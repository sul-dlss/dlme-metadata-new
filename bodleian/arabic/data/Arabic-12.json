A. in The Selden roll: an Ancient Mexican picture manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (Berlin, 1955). This unfortunately incomplete painted roll from the Coixtlahuaca region incorporates both Mixtec and Aztec elements. It apparently records myths of origin and the migratory journey of historical or mythical ancestors up to the time when early settlement begins. Lines of footprints are used to indicate movement of people. Dates are given according to the Mixtec calendar (see also 'Codex Bodley', MS. Mex. d. 1), and temples are represented as plinths on a paved area, rather than great pyramids. Written on native amatl paper, this roll is painted only on one side. Entirely non-European, but post-Conquest.", "materials": "paper (amatl)", "collection": "Images from 35mm Slides and Filmstrips", "digitization_project": "Medieval and Renaissance Manuscript Illumination (from 35mm)", "record_created": "2018-08-01T13:00:00Z", "holding_institution": "Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford"}
