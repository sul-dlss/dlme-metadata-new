Of the original eight books, 1-4 survive in Greek, 5-7 are preserved only in Arabic translation, and the eighth is lost. The Arabic translators were Hilāl ibn Abī Hilāl al-Ḥimṣī (Books 1-4) and Thābit ibn Qurrah (Books 5-7). Edmund Halley made use of this fine copy in preparing his complete edition of the Conica, printed at Oxford in 1710 CE.", "collection": "Arabic Manuscripts and Maps", "record_created": "2018-08-01T13:00:00Z", "holding_institution": "Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford"}
