Only the sides of this box are preserved, and it may have held a number of ushabti figures or a set of canopic jars. The deities associated with death and the afterlife are represented on the box's panels. There is the figure of a jackal on top of a shrine, which represents the embalming god Anubis. Isis and Nephthys flank the large symbol of Osiris and the four sons of Horus. All of the inscriptions are related to the god Osiris.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase with funds provided by the S. & A.P.
