Its flat underside is incised with a vertically arranged design of a pair of facing, connected \"Udjat\" eyes with script signs below. The design of the back of the scarab is simple with short and aligned carved side-notches and a well proportioned layout. The workmanship of the piece is slightly rough and it is not very carefully made.\r\n\r\nThis scarab originally functioned as an amulet. It should protect the life and regeneration of its owner and provide divine support. The piece was originally mounted or threaded.\r\n\r\nThe very stylized shape of \"Udjat\"-eye-pair was common in the late Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/3908", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "15th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Canaanite", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1522053", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.39_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.39_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.39_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.39_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.39_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
