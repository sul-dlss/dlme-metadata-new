He is nude except for elaborate, high-laced and open-front boots. His hair is elaborate, with long tendrils hanging down his shoulders, curls on the sides of his head, a top knot above his forehead, and the rest of his hair coiled in a bun at the back of his neck. He wears various bands (some with fruits as appropriate to Dionysus) around this forehead, topknot, and bun. Various parts of the figure are out of proportion, including the hands, which are large compared to the arms and torso, and the head, which is quite small and especially in contrast to the overly large eyes and eyebrows.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1909", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/4690", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [as from Upper Egypt]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1909, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2018-04-11T01:00:00.933", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.815_Fnt_DD_AT18-034358-tms.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.815_Fnt_DD_AT18-034358-tms.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.815_Fnt_DD_AT18-034358-tms.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.815_Fnt_DD_AT18-034358-tms.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.815_Fnt_DD_AT18-034358-tms.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544299", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_54.815_BackAT_H74-tms.jpg, PL7_54.815_FntAT_H74-tms.jpg, PS1_54.815_3QtrLft_DD_AT18-034365-tms.jpg, PS1_54.815_3QtrRt_DD_AT18-034389-tms.jpg, PS1_54.815_Back_DD_AT18-034377-tms.jpg, PS1_54.815_Back3QtrLft_DD_AT18-034371-tms.jpg, PS1_54.815_Back3QtrRt_", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
