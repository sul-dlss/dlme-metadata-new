The ornamentation includes garlands, birds, and animals, all popular motifs in Early Byzantine Egypt.  This type of tunic was worn by men, women, and children, and dates from as early as the 3rd century.  The wool garment is woven in one piece, with colorful, decorative panels (segmenta), vertical strips (clavi), and neck and sleeve bands.
