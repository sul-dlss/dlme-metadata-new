While early 12th Dynasty in style, this impressive seated statue shows Itj-ibj in a classic pose copied from Old Kingdom sculpture: hands balanced on his thighs, the left flat and the right clenched in a fist, holding a folded cloth. \r\n\t\r\nTraces of red paint with white spots remain on the fleshy areas of the sculpture, and it has been suggested that the exposed parts of the body were painted to make the limestone resemble red granite, a more costly stone.\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1927", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26545", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Maurice Nahman, Cairo, by 1926, [mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1927, by purchase [Joseph Brummer as agent; Brummer inv. no.
