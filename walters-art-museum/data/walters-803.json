They combine different divine aspects to provide the donator of such an image with all possible protection and support. The magical function of these representations is well-known and some of the images, such as on papyri, were combined with magic spells or words. This figure combines aspects of a human body, a jackal, and a ram head, with a bird's tail and wings. He is standing on crocodiles and his crown refers to Amun and Osiris. All of these symbols clarify that the depicted divine creature embodies all major divine aspects as well as magical power.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/34569", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Giovanni Dattri, Cairo, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Lambros-Dattari Sale, Hotel Drouot, Paris, 1912, June 17-19, 1912, p. 48, no. 418; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1912, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:40.643", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2083_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2083_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2083_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2083_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2083_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172", "Images": "ARG_54.2083_Fnt_BW.jpg, PS1_54.2083_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2083_3QtrRt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2083_Back_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2083_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2083_Lft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2083_Rt_DD_T12.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
