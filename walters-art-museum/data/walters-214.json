The composition is made up of animated vignettes. Look, for example, in the right corner, where a man in orange sits with betel quids—a mild stimulant—arrayed in front of him, watching two men embroiled in a dispute, one with a dagger drawn. A second pair, at the far end and close to the pavilion, seems also to be enraged enough to draw blood. The rest look on in anticipation, smoking and conversing.", "CreditLine": "Gift of John and Berthe Ford, 2002", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/7883", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Mughal; Illustration; Painting; India", "Provenance": "John and Berthe Ford, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 2002, by gift.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.904.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.904.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.904.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.904.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.904.a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689, 1507079", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CPS_W.904.a_Fp_DD.jpg, CPS_W.904_Det_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
