Both pieces tell the story of King David.  This fragment depicts David the musician.  The ankh, an ancient Egyptian symbol of life, was adopted by Egyptian Christians as a variant of the cross.  Its presence between the heads of the two figures suggests a Christian owner.  Several smaller roundels with equestrian figures originally accompanied the scene.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase, 1977", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/8526", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Estate of Dikran Kelekian;  Charles Kelekian [date of acquisition unknown], by inheritance;  Walters Art Museum, 1977, by purchase.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-04-03T17:22:19.057", "Creator": "Coptic", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": null, "Small": null, "Medium": null, "Large": null, "Raw": null}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2672", "Images": "PL7_83.728_Fnt_BW.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
