Attributable to the early 11th century AH/17th century AD, it is in the style of drawing defined by the school of the famous Persian artist Riza 'Abbasi (active AH 1001-1044/AD 1591-1592 to 1634). The composition is the reverse of a work by the Safavid painter Sadiqi (AH 939-1018/AD 1533-1610) in the Musée du Louvre published by Ivan Stchoukine in 1929 that has been identified as a depiction of a mullah (religious scholar). The illuminated borders of landscape scenes and gazelles are slightly later than the drawing and probably date to the late 11th century AH/17th century AD.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26833", "Keywords": "Islamic; Persian; Safavid; Illumination; Illustration; Miniature; Drawing; Iran", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Safavid Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Iranian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.681.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.681.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.681.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.681.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.681.a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667", "ExhibIDs": "2339", "Images": "CPS_W.681.a_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
