As part of a composition of the Descent from the Cross, it shows Joseph of Arimathea ready to receive Christ's dead body taken down for burial. The bowl from which the dispersed pieces come is one of a kind. Discovered in Egypt, it was probably made there for use in a local Christian church. Remarkably, its technique and style closely resemble Islamic pottery from the same period.", "CreditLine": "Gift of Barbara R.
