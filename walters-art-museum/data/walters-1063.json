Seyller and Brend read it as dated 42 and thus interpret it as the 42nd year of Emperor Akbar's reign, i.e. AD March 1597-March 1598. According to Seyller the vertical stroke that precedes the 42 should be regarded as an extended dot over the nun in the word sana (year). According to Brend the vertical stroke should be read as an alif for ilahi.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/78322", "Keywords": "Islamic; Mughal; Persian; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Colophon; Illumination; Illustration; Manuscript; Medallion; Painting; Original Binding; Binding; India; Literature -- Poetry", "Provenance": "Muhammad Zaki, 1241 AH/AD 1825-1826 [mode of acquisition unknown] [oval seal, fols. 1a, 211a]; 'abd al-raji Muhammad Shafi', 1247 AH/AD 1831-1832 [mode of acquisition unknown] [rectangular seal fols. 1a, 211a]; Muhammad 'Ali [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [large oval seal with no date on fol. 211a]; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Amir Khusraw Dihlavi (died ca. 729 AH/AD 1328)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.624.211a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.624.211a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.624.211a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.624.211a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.624.211a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1496883", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CPS_W.624.211a_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
