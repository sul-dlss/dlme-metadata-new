A question exists as to whether these rings were ever actually used as signets or were for funerary purposes, religious souvenirs, or gifts for special occasions. It seems probable that rings with blank bezels were mass-made in molds and that, while the material was soft before firing, the inscription was added. \r\n\r\nThis small version is made of blue faience. Incrustations exist in the shallow crudely carved hieroglyphs which read \"Men-ib-re, right of voice, the great god,\" a fictitious name which is attested elsewhere.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/3685", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-17T15:10:01.847", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.416_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.416_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.416_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.416_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.416_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2513", "Images": "CUR_42.416_SideA_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.416_SideB_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.416_SideC_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.416_SideD_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.416_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
