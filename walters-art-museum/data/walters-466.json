The interlocking figures and the pyramidal silhouette are distinctly Hellenistic.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1909", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19363", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [said to be from Kharbia, Lower Egypt]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1909, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-11-10T17:07:59.19", "Creator": "Greek", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.1050_Fnt_DD_T06.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.1050_Fnt_DD_T06.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.1050_Fnt_DD_T06.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.1050_Fnt_DD_T06.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.1050_Fnt_DD_T06.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2089, 2536, 2644, 2237, 3294", "Images": "PS1_54.1050_3Qtr_DD_T06.jpg, PS1_54.1050_Back_DD_T06.jpg, PS1_54.1050_DetA_DD_T06.jpg, PS1_54.1050_DetB_DD_T06.jpg, PS1_54.1050_Fnt_DD_T06.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Greek Art"}
