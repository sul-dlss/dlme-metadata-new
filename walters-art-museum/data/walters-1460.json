The upper part displays arabesque leaves and tendrils and the buckle as well as lower tip is decorated with rhombic and rosette-shaped appliqués. The back of the upper part is blank.

They were very precious, and kept in families for generations.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the sheath is an Arabic stamp with the name of the ruler and a date: al-Mansur 115x. The stamp belongs to Imam al-Mansur al-Husayn, who lived from AH 1139 to 1161 (AD 1775-1809).\r\n\r\nAn engraved inscription in Hebrew names the silversmith: H(arun) Kasil.
