Between the curved horns of the ibex is a projection with a rectangular tang. This tang would attach to the crossbar of the lyre. The angle of the piece and the shortness of its length suggest that it was fitted as the shorter support of an asymmetrical lyre. The ibex head would have faced outward. The piece is well preserved and the ibex is realistically rendered right down to a tiny projection representing a bearded tuft beneath the chin of the animal. According to Peter Lacovara the base of this piece may be located in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/12993", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th-20th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:41.3", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_61.270_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_61.270_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_61.270_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_61.270_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_61.270_Fnt_SL_T.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_61.270_NF_4058-tms.jpg, PL9_61.270_Fnt_SL_T.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
