Both are from the opening chapter, entitled The conduct of kings. The lower register depicts a king who had given a large sum of money to a beggar, who squandered it and then returned for more. At first, the king refused the beggar additional money, but his minister advised him to allot the poor man an allowance in installments so that he would not squander it. This anecdote is meant to illustrate that one should not render someone hopeful by an act of unbounded kindness and then dash his or her hopes. The upper register depicts a prince visiting holy men in the wilderness.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/77496", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Mughal; Persian; Safavid; Qajar; Calligraphy; Illumination; Illustration; Miniature; Painting; Accordion book; Album; India; Iran; Literature -- Poetry", "Provenance": "'Abduh Khudadad, 1189 AH/AD 1775 [mode of acquisition unknown] [seal impression: 'Abduh Khudadad, 1189 AH/AD 1775 on fol. 58a]; Farhad, 1234 AH/AD 1800 [mode of acquisition unknown] [seal impression: Farhad, 1234 AH/AD 1800 on a number of folios];\r\nMuhammad al-Hasani [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [seal impression: Muhammad al-Hasani on fol. 28a]; Fath 'Ali [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [seal impression: Fath 'Ali on fol. 82b]; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty, Safavid Dynasty, Qajar Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Islamic", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_W.668.49a_Fnt_DD_T09.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_W.668.49a_Fnt_DD_T09.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_W.668.49a_Fnt_DD_T09.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_W.668.49a_Fnt_DD_T09.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_W.668.49a_Fnt_DD_T09.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689, 1507667", "ExhibIDs": "2509, 2714, 2827", "Images": "PS1_W.668.49a_Fnt_DD_T09.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
