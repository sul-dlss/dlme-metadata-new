The top of the scarab is high and simple with carved details. The workmanship of the piece is good, and it is carefully made. \r\n\r\nThis amulet has kingship connotations, and was originally mounted or threaded. The royal title and the unification icon refer both the the association of the dualistic aspects of kingship and state, as well as of the whole creation. The amulet should provide its owner with royal support and guarantee a stable and well-organized environment. The unification icon also has a renewal connotation. \r\n\r\nThe combined use of the title and icon is much less common than the icon alone. The five times serration of the clypeus of the scarab is rare, and does not have many parallels.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1911 (?)", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/662", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1911 (?)
