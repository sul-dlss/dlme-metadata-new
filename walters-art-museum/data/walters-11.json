In keeping with artistic conventions, he is placed in the center, larger than the two other figures, and receives their supportive gestures. The smaller man is Teti's father, also named Teti, while the woman is the elder Teti's wife, Meket. The reference to the god Ptah of ancient Memphis in the inscription on the front of the younger Teti's kilt suggests that the sculpture may have been dedicated in a temple there. This association with Memphis might also account for the statue's unusual pyramid-like shape, as a similarly shaped sacred monument, called the \"benben,\" was worshiped in the region.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1926", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/184", "Keywords": "priest; family; kilt; hieroglyph; high relief; Granodiorite", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1926, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty", "Reign": "Thutmosis IV (1397-1388 BC)", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.063", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.163_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.163_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.163_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.163_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.163_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544370", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL9_22.163_Fnt_SL_T.jpg, PS1_22.163_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_22.163_Lft_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
