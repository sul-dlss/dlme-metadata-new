The work dates from the Crusader period (1097-1291), when Islamic imagery, including inscriptions in Arabic, as here, was often combined with Christian themes.  It includes compositions in which figures resembling saints alternate with two-storied, domed structures that may represent monastic communities.  A smaller vessel in the Walters collection (Walters 47.18), perhaps made to pair with this beaker, depicts a figure riding a grey donkey -- possibly Christ entering Jerusalem.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1925", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/30576", "Keywords": "Arabic; animals; architecture; mosque; calligraphy", "Provenance": "G.
