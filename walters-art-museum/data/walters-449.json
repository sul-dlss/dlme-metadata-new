Written for the library of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I, it was completed in Bursa in 918 AH/AD 1512, the year of that ruler's accession to the throne. The text, which opens with an illuminated headpiece (fol. 1b), is written in Naskh script mostly in black ink with certain words, such as qawluhu and aqulu, in red. It is possible that the scribe is also the author of this work. The brown goatskin binding with central lobed oval and pendants with arabesque designs is contemporary with the manuscript.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/18627", "Keywords": "Arabic; Book; Codex; Colophon; Manuscript; Contemporary Binding; Turkey; Logic", "Provenance": "Izzat [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [ex libiris (min kutub), seal erased on fol. 1a]; 'Abd al-Qadir [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [ex libris, fol. 1a]; Muhammad Amin, Inspector of awqaf [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [bequest entry on behalf of Bashir Agha with seal and the shelfmark 419 on fol. 1a; bequest (waqf) seal of of Bashir Agha dated 1130 AH/AD 1717; the same seal is also present on fols. 2a, 35a, 52a, and 77b; the shelfmark 419 is also inscribed on the tail edge]; al-Hajj Bashir Agha Dar al-Sa'adah, 1130 AH/AD 1717, by bequest [ex libiris, dated 1158 AH/AD 1745 (plus his seal) on fol. 1a, middle of the page; the same seal is also on fols. 32b and 78a]; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": "Sultan Selim I", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Muhammad ibn Pir Ahmad al-shahir bi-Ibn Arghun al-Shirazi (early 16th century)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.591.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.591.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.591.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.591.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.591.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1501461", "ExhibIDs": "112, 2730", "Images": "CPS_W.591.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
