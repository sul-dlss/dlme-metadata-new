Girsu was an important religious and civic center in the 3rd millennium BCE. Gudea ruled over the city-state of Lagash (in southern Iraq) in the second half of the 22nd century BCE (ca. 2144-2124 BCE). In this text, Gudea draws attention to his personal connections to two deities: Ningeshzida, his patron, and Gatumdu (or Gatumdug), a goddess local to Lagash. Over one hundred examples of this text are known, appearing mostly on clay nails. \r\n\r\nClay cones and nails were inscribed in the name of a ruler of a Mesopotamian city-state to  commemorate an act of building or rebuilding, often of a temple for a specific deity. Deposited in the walls or under the foundations of these structures, the words of the texts were directed at the gods but would be found by later restorers.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19678", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Edgar J.
