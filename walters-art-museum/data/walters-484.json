The slight fleshiness of the body hint at the owner's desire to be seen as successful and, therefore, well fed.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1930", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19866", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Maurice Nahman, Cairo and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1930, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.\r\n", "Dynasty": "early 12th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:41.33", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_71.509_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_71.509_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_71.509_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_71.509_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_71.509_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485, 1544497", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PS1_71.509_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_71.509_Back_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_71.509_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
