The two most common shapes take their names from Greek pottery: \"amphoriskoi\" (little amphoras) and \"krateriskoi\" (little kraters). This vessel is an example of the former, with its broad shoulders, rounded base, and opaque white ground. It is a core-formed vessel; the technology of blown glass was as of yet unknown. The molten mass, composed of silica and natron (heated to a temperature of around 1000°-1150° C) was wrapped around a clay or dung core that was later removed. Decorative bands were formed by pressing threads of colored glass onto the molten surface; combing the threads with a metal tool created decorative patterns.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/28178", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "F.
