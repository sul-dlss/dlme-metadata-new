With the exception of the elephant, used as a hunting steed, these animals were regularly hunted in Mughal India. The decoration thus alludes to the object’s function: flasks holding gunpowder were essential firearm accessories in royal hunts. The lavishness of the materials, however, which originally included paint and gilding, and the refinement of its execution far exceed a purely utilitarian function. \r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1925", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/2698", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Lucien Demotte [1906-1934], Paris; purchased by Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1925; by bequest to Walters Art Museum, 1931.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.33", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS3_71.418_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS3_71.418_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS3_71.418_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS3_71.418_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS3_71.418_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PS3_71.418_Back_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_DetA_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_DetB_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_DetC_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_DetD_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_DetE_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_DetF_DD_T10.jpg, PS3_71.418_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
