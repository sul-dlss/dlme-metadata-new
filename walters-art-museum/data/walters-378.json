This exceptional fish pendant depicts a \"Tilapia nilotica,\" a common species in the Nile. It was appreciated for its taste, and was also regarded as a symbol of rebirth and resurrection because it carries its eggs in its mouth and was, therefore, believed to be self-created. Carnelian was very popular in the New Kingdom and was used especially for rings, pendants, and other items of jewelry.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1926", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/15392", "Keywords": "fish; god; religion; magic; food; Resurrection", "Provenance": "William Tyssen-Amherst, London, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Collection of Lord Carmichael of Skirling [a few miles north of Biggar, Scotland] [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Antiquities of the Collection of the Late Lord Carmichael of Skirling Sale, Sotheby and Company, London, June 9, 1926, p. 22, lot 233 (19); Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, 1926, by purchase; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1926, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.58", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_42.196_RtSide_DD_T12.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_42.196_RtSide_DD_T12.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_42.196_RtSide_DD_T12.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_42.196_RtSide_DD_T12.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_42.196_RtSide_DD_T12.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "1954, 2227, 2513, 2682, 3193, 3240", "Images": "PL1_42.196_Prof_TR_C79II.jpg, PS1_42.196_LftSide_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_42.196_RtSide_DD_T12.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
