According to the colophon, it was completed by Shaykh Kamal ibn 'Abd al-Haqq al-Sabzawari, the calligrapher and illuminator, in Astarabad (present-day Gorgan, Iran) in 941 AH/AD 1534. The text, divided into 5 compartments, is in calligraphic vocalized Naskh in black ink and vocalized Thuluth in gold ink outlined in black. Illuminated rosettes with colored dots serve as verse markers. The decorated colophon (fol. 8b) is written in Tawqi'/Riqa' in gold ink.
