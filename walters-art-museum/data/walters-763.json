He was worshiped at Thebes (in southern Egypt) from the beginning of the Middle Kingdom (2046 BC). The Egyptians considered him to be \"King of the Gods\" and divine father of the pharaoh. He was also worshiped in Nubia and was the principal god of the Kushite empire (in present-day Sudan).\r\n\r\nThe style of the figure clarifies that it was made when the Kushites ruled both Egypt and Nubia. The god wears his characteristic feather-crown combined with the solar disk of the sun-god Re. The attributes he would originally have held were probably the symbols for prosperity (\"was\") and life (\"ankh\").\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1911", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/32904", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1911, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "25th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:40.393", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.413_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.413_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.413_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.413_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.413_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544582", "ExhibIDs": "3193, 3240", "Images": "PS1_54.413_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_54.413_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_54.413_Back_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_54.413_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_54.413_Lft_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_54.413_Rt_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
