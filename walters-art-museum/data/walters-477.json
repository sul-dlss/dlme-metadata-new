It represents a son's lamentation at his father's funeral. The parent manuscript was likely produced in Timurid Herat or Bukhara in the late 9th century AH/AD 15th. There are fewer than 10 known illustrated copies of the Mantiq al-tayr. In the bottom right corner is a later attribution to the famous Persian artist Bihzad (died 942 AH/AD 1536-1537). The painting is surrounded by a biscuit-colored, gold-sprinkled border. The Walters' leaf is comparable to the same scene illustrated in the copy housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (63.210.35).", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19657", "Keywords": "Islamic; Persian; Timurid; Illustration; Miniature; Painting; Iran", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Timurid Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Farid al-Din 'Attar (died 618 AH/AD 1221)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.678.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.678.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.678.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.678.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.678.a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1520224, 1521790", "ExhibIDs": "709", "Images": "CPS_W.678.a_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
