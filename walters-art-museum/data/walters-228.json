When complete, the statue showed the owner offering a \"naos\" or shrine, to his god.  Signs of age, with hints of bittersweet emotion, appear only in the private sculpture of the Late Period and Ptolemaic Period, never in royal works.  This is in direct opposition to works of the Middle Kingdom where signs of age, weariness, and care appeared first in royal facial features.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/8571", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.22", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.395_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.395_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.395_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.395_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.395_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL9_22.395_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
