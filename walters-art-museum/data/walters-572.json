He also refers to himself as ruler of the Amnanum, an Amorite tribe that also had links to Babylon and as far north as Mari. More than one hundred examples of this text survive, appearing on bricks, tablets, and cones. \r\n\r\nClay cones and nails were inscribed in the name of a ruler of a Mesopotamian city-state to commemorate an act of building or rebuilding, often of a temple for a specific deity. Deposited in the walls or under the foundations of these structures, the words of the texts were directed at the gods but would be found by later restorers.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase, 1941", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/24024", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Sadie Jones (Mrs. Henry Walters), New York, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Sale, Joseph Brummer, New York, 1941 [Brummer inv. no.
