This statue represents Djed-khonsu-iuef-ankh, a priest of the god Montu of Thebes. He holds a statuette of Osiris, god of the underworld. Priests cared for cult images of the gods by cleaning and clothing them, as well as, offering them daily food and drink. The inscriptions on this statue indicate that it was placed in the Temple of Montu at Karnak and was dedicated on behalf of Djed-khonsu-iuef-ankh by his son, Khonsu-mes. The owner of such a statue benefited during his life, but also after his death, from the rituals for the god with whom he is represented.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1911", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14770", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1911, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "late 25th-early 26th Dynasty", "Reign": "Taharqa-Psametik I", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.08", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.174_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.174_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.174_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.174_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.174_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544582", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PS1_22.174_3QtrLft_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_Back_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_Bot_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_DetA_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_DetB_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_DetC_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_DetD_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.174_DetE_DD_T11.jpg,", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
