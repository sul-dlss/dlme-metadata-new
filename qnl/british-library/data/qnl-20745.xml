[pp. 423-5\ The progress of the Wahhabi power in Eastern Arabia now claims our attention. In 1800, after the occupation of the Hasa and Qatif Oases by the Wahhabis, a large Wahhabi detachment, mounted on horses and camels, made their way thence by land to Baraimi on the confines of the 'Oman Sultanate; here their leader Hariq, a Nubian slave, established a fortified settlement; and here the Na'im, Bani Qitab and other tribes of Dhahirah, who were unfriendly to the central government of 'Oman, quickly identified themselves with the Wahhabi cause. Saiyid Sultan, ever prompt in action, made peace with his enemy the Qasimi Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and marched, via Wadi-al-Jizi, against Baraimi; but the result of the first encounter was so unfavourable that he made a truce with Hanq and retired on Sohar. This temporary respite from hostilities at home enabled Sultan, as we have seen, to prosecute his designs against Bahrain with some measure of success; but, in that direction also, the influence of the Wahhabis, which was thrown into the scale of the 'Utub, retarded the progress of his arms; and a fresh breach with the Wahhabi Amir, which occurred in 1803, destroyed his last hope of success in Bahrain. The immediate cause of the final rupture seems to have been the favourable reception by Sultan of overtures from the Sharifs of Makkah, who were then endeavouring to defend the Hijaz district of Western Arabia against the assaults of the Wahhabis. Early in 1803 Sultan had himself gone on pilgrimage to the Holy Cities, leaving 'Oman to be governed in his absence by his young son Salim, assisted by a council of regency; and, though he did not himself take any active part in the hostilities between the Sharifs and the Amir, he assisted the former with money and munitions of war, and possibly also with the loan of a small armed contingent. During the absence of Sultan his nephew Badar, the son of Saif, after failing in an attempt to obtain possession of Fort Jalali at Masqat, fled to 'Ajman and thence to Zubarah, eventually making his way to Dara'tyah, where he associated himself closely with the Wahhabi Amir. The resentment of the Wahhabi ruler at Sultan's conduct in Hijaz affairs, intensified by the aversion which he already felt for him as an Ibadhi heretic, at length broke forth in a declaration of war. As suzerain of the Qawasim of Ras- al-Khaimah and of the 'Utub of Bahrain and Kuwait, the Wahhabi Amir now called upon them, unwilling though they were to abandon the pearl fishery for the season, to cruise against the subjects of the 'Oman Government; and they reluctantly obeyed his summons. Alarmed by a new development that seemed to threaten the future safety of their own coasts, the Persian and Turkish authorities in the Gulf at first showed a disposition to make common cause with Saiyid Sultan; but for want of courage, or possibly of the appropriate means, their good intentions remained inoperative; and the ruler of 'Oman was left to bear the brunt of the Wahhabi's displeasure alone. Sultan quickly destroyed the war fleet of the 'Utub; but his enemies were too numerous for him, even at sea; and he found himself unable to undertake offensive operations and at the same time protect his own coasts from ravage. A descent by a hostile squadron on the island of Qishm, then a dependency of 'Oman, which they overran and pillaged, was among the incidents of this maritime warfare. At last, a mission having been sent by Sultan to Dara'iyah, a truce was concluded for three years on condition that 'Oman should pay an annual tribute of $12,000, and that a Wahhabi political agent should be allowed to reside at Masqat. The truce, however, had hardly begun, when it was violated by the Wahhabis. The Wahhabi troops under Hariq entered the Batinah district, committing unspeakable atrocities as they advanced towards Masqat; and a force was despatched by Saiyid Sultan for the defence of Suwaiq which was in danger, was ambushed by them in difficult ground and almost altogether annihilated. In this emergency a national council of war was convened by Saiyid Sultan at Barkah, and it was resolved to continue the struggle against the invaders to the uttermost. The first objective of the patriotic assembly was to raise the siege of Sohar, where Hariq, after his successful action near Suwaiq, had invested Qais; and Khaburah was appointed as a place of rendezvous for the tribes of 'Oman. When, however, a large force had collected at Khaburah and was about to march on Sohar, Hariq, who in the meanwhile had probably received intelligence of the assassination of Early pro ceedings of the Wahhabis in 'Oman.

Aggressions of the Wahhabis and Egyptians, 1829-56. [pp. 456-8] The dangers which threatened 'Oman from the side of Najd during the later part of Sa'id's reign are so little connected with the course or local affairs just related as to be capable of separate consideration; their appearance and disappearance were regulated chiefly by the crises through which the Wahhabi kingdom itself passed during this period. w By 1830 the power of the Wahhabis, temporarily crushed at its centre in 1818, had revived to a considerable extent in Eastern Arabia; and in 1833 their pressure was felt once more on the frontiers of 'Oman. The British Government in India, who admitted no responsibility for the defence of the Saiyid's dominions by land, having approved his intention of entering into a friendly understandinng with the Wahhabi Amir, a compact was formed between the Saiyid and the Wahhabis under which the limits of direct government of the contracting powers were defined and Sa'id undertook to pay $5,000 a year as Zakat to the ruler of Najd. A further stipulation by which each party was bound to assist in suppressing rebellion in the dominions of the other was deemed imprudent by the British authorities, especially in view of the hostile relations existing between the Wahhabis and the Pasha of Egypt; but Sa'id assured them that the observance of this article would be regulated, on his part, by a strict regard for the wishes of the British Govern ment. The arrangement just described appears to have been negotiated with the Wahhabi general Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq by Saiyid Sa'id immediately before his third expedition to East Africa, but there is nothing to show how long the tribute promised continued to be paid. The abortive combination formed by Sa'id and the Wahhabis in 1836 for the purpose of expelling Hamiid-bin-'Azzan from Sohar and Rustaq has already been noticed under the head of internal affairs. In 1839 the Egyptians occupied the position in Central Arabia from which they had ousted the Wahhabis; but they continued the domineering policy of their predecessors towards Oman, and they even made use of the same local agents, namely Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq and Bin-Battal. Sa'id, in order to promote his designs on Bahrain, which he had never abandoned, was disposed at first to conform his policy to that of Muhammad 'Ali, Pasha of Egypt; but, on becoming aware of the anti-Egyptian sentiments of the British Government in what concerned Eastern Arabia, he associated himeslf with their views, underwent the reconciliation already mentioned with his kinsman Hamud of Sohar, who was a consistent opponent of Egyptian influence, and disregarded a peremtory demand made on him for assistance by Khurshid Pasha, the Egyptian Commander in Najd. Such correspondence with the Egyptian authorities as he could not avoid he carried on henceforward with the cognisance and approval of the British Government. The danger to 'Oman from the Egyptians ceased only on the withdrawal of the latter from Najd in 1840. At the beginning of 1845, during Sa'id's longest absence from 'Oman, Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq appeared once more at Baraimi in his original and familiar character of Wahhabi agent, captured Majls, and demanded tribute of Sa'id's representative (Saiyid Thuwaini) and of Hamud (the Sohar chief) at the rate of $20,000 and $5,000 per annum respectively. Hamud was ready to appeal to arms, but Thuwaini preferred to temporise; and a truce was patched ud on the under standing that $5,000 down should be paid on account of Sohar, while the rest of the demand was referred to Saiyid Sa'id at Zanzibar. This arrangement was in consonance with the advice of the British Resident in the Persian'Gulf, who on the first appearance of danger had counselled Thuwaini to comply with the Wahhabi demands, provided they were not excessive or humiliating, and in the opposite case to threaten a reference to the British Government. Sa'ad-bin Mutlaq soon violated the truce by permitting a raid on Barkah, and began to collect a huge levy of tribesmen, largely Bani Qitab, for an attack of Masqat: in this emergency the British Resident in the Gulf addressed a stringent protest to the Amir, enjoined Sa'ad to await his master's orders, and sent British war-vessels to cruise upon the Batinah coast. These steps caused the Wahhabi to abate his demands; he agreed to accept, exclusive of an initial present of $2,000, an annual tribute of $5,000 a year which Thuwaini under his father's instructions was willing3 to pay; and the Wahhabi expedition was then broken up, and Majis restored to the ruler of 'Oman. The prestige of the Wahhabis seems to have suffered by this settlement, for we now tind a number of local chiefs and tribes—particularly the Yal Sa'ad—arming against them; and their messengers in Batinah were after this frequently detained and otherwise treated with contumely. At the end of 1852 'Abdullah-bin-Faisal, the son of the Wahhabi Amir, arrived at Baraimi with a commission to extend and enforce the authority of his father's Government. Taking advantage of the recent expulsion of Qais-bin- 'Azzan from Sohar, he required the cession of that district by Saiyid Sa'id, and demanded an increase of tribute so great as to make it apparent that what he really wished was a pretext for declaring war. The British Resident in the Gulf, who had meanwhile reached the coast of Trucial 'Oman upon a different errand, at once applied himself to counteracting the influence and prestige of the Wahhabis, and at the same time encouraged the regent Thuwaini to resistance by a promise to assist him, if need be, in the defence of his capital: his attitude emboldened Saiyid Thuwaini to proceed to Sohar, which he placed in a state of defence. The Wahhabis then abandoned their design of attacking Batinah, and a compromise was arranged under which the frontiers of 'Oman remained intact, but the yearly- tribute payable to the Wahhabis was increased from $5,000 to $12,000; simultaneously an oifensive and defensive alliance was established between the signatories, the Wahhabis in particular undertaking to assist the regent Thuwaini hT case of internal difficulties. In the next year, the tribes of Batinah having withheld their contributions and payment of the stipulated tribute being consequently impossible, Thuwaini called upon 'Abdullah-bin-Faisal for the aid guaranteed by the recent treaty; it was afforded, though not without reluctance; and at the end of 1853 the refractory tribes had been coerced and amity still prevailed between the Government of 'Oman and the Wahhabi power. Ahmad the Sadairi, whom the Wahhabis now placed in charge of Baraimi, seems about this time to have undertaken a tour in 'Oman Proper, where he probably wrung fresh contributions from the inhabitants, irrespective of the tribute already paid for the whole country by the ruler of 'Oman. Renewed Wahhabi aggressions and British intervention, 1864-66. [pp. 473-6] Toward the end of 1864, when hostilities broke out between the Sultan and 'Azzan-bin-Qais of Rustaq, the latter received support from Turki-bin-Ahmad the Sadairi, Wahhabi agent at Baraimi. Saiyid Thuwaini, in alarm, at once sougnt the mediation of the British Government and asked to be supplied wit ammunition; and Colonel Pelly, the Resident in the Persian Gull who was then on the point of undertaking his remarkable journey to Riyadh in Central Arabia, was ordered by Government to report upon the situation. No rurtner deve op- ments took place until Colonel Pelly's return from the interior, when, in April 186^, he proceeded to Masqat and there ascertained that Azzan-bin-Qais had thrown off his allegiance to Thuwaini and placed himsell under the Wahhabi Amir, and that the Amir had begun to demand increased tribute from Oman and to threaten an invasion of the country in case of non -compliance. Colonel Pelly on becoming aware of these facts sent a letter to the Wahhabi Amir, with whom his visit to Riyadh had made him personally acquainted, offering his own sei vices as a mediator, and he also invited 'Azzan-bin-Qais to a conference at Masqat, but the letter remained unanswered, and the invitation was politely declined. In August 1865 the usual Wahhabi mission arrived at Masqat and demanded four times the customary annual tribute; the Sultan, by the advice of Colonel Disbrowe, the British Political Agent, paid the ordinary amount and sent a message to the Amir that, as regards the remainder, he awaited the result of Colonel Pelly s offer of mediation. , • , , In the same month the Jannabah of Sur, who were discontented with the Sultan's rule, sought Wahhabi assistance trom Baraimi; and the Wahhabi agent, nothing loth, sent his brother and a Wahhabi contingent who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by some of the disaffected tribes of Ja'alan, especially the Jannabah and Bani Bil 'Ali. A garrison occupying a fort on behalf ol the Sultan of Oman held out for two days; but they were unable to prevent the entrance of the enemy into the quarter, and eventually they themselves surrendered. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell upon Hindu traders and shopkeepers of the place, who were British Indian subjects; the extent of their losses was estimated at $27,700, and one of 48533 c Tribute from 'Oman to the Wahhabis enhanced to $12,000 in 1853.

They were prevented Irom disposing in the ordinary way of the corpse of their companion; and, before being allowed to leave for Masqat, they were stripped of almost all their clothing. The Sultan, after a feeble demonstration by sea in the direction of Sur, purchased peace of the Wahhabis by one payment of $10,000 and another of Rs. 6,000; but the British authorities in India, conscious that policy and self-interest required them to abandon their usual attitude of neutrality, now incited him to resistance and prepared to aid him with munitions and ships of war in re-estab lishing his authority at places where it had been overthrown by the Wahhabis. On the advice of Colonel Pelly, Thuwaini was shortly afterwards supplied with two guns and a large quantity of powder and other ammunition for an assault upon Baraimi, which was clearly recognised to be the key of the Wahhabi position in 'Oman, and the Sultan began to collect his tribes for the expedition,—measures to which the Wahhabis replied by an attack on Saham, where some Banyans, British Indian subjects, were driven into the sea, one of them being drowned. The British Political Resident also addressed notifications to the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, reminding those who were partisans of the Wahhabis that their ports were within range of British naval guns, and informing the others, who sided with the Sultan, that they were at liberty to proceed to his assistance by land. These were the local dispositions made to meet the situation; and among those of a further-reaching character, more fully noticed in the history of Najd, was an ultimatum sent through his seaport of Qatif to the Wahhabi Amir, in which a written apology and compensation for the outrage at Sur was demanded. No reply to the ultimatum having been received within the limit of time prescribed, naval operations against the Wahhabis followed at Qatif and Damman; and on the 11th of February H.M.S. ' Highflyer ' appeared off Sur to insist on atonement by the Jannabah for their part in the affair of August by payment of $27,700 com pensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate, a fire was opened which demolished their forts; the whole of their boats were either confiscated or destroyed; and a large quantity of their ship-timber was burned. No personal injury was suffered by non-combatants, who were given ample opportunity to remove; but a small part of the town was accidentally burned, in consequence of a change in the direction of the wind. At length, on the 20th of February, two letters from the Wahhabi Amir reached Colonel Pelly, who had taken up his post of observations at the British telegraph station then existing in Khor-ash-Sham: the first, which was dated 28th January, accepted Colonel Pelly's mediation between the Wahhabis and the State of 'Oman, subject apparently to a condition that the British Government should undertake to enforce the award; while the second, in reply to the British ultimatum, stated that an agent would be sent to discuss matters and that the Jannabah were guilty of the outrage at Sur, but that the Armr recognised his responsibility for recovering damages from them. The Government of India animadverted on the stringency of the demands which had been made by their representative at Qatif and Sur, and on the shortness of the time allowed for compliance with the British terms at both those places; but they were on the whole satisfied with the result of the operations. In April 1866 Wahhabi emissaries from 'Abdullah, who had recently succeeded his father Faisal as ruler of the Wahhabis, arrived at Bushehr and undertook, besides giving other more general assurances, that the Amir should not in future attack Arab tribes in alliance with the British, especially those of 'Oman, so long as the customary Zakat was punctually paid. The British Government on their part declined to guarantee the payment of Zakat, but the good offices of the Bushehr Residency were promised in any dispute which might arise on the subject. The subject of this mission in its wider aspects is discussed in the history of British relations with Najd. Baraimi taken by 'Azzan from the Wahhabis, 1869. Relations of 'Azzan with the Wahhabis, 1869-70. [pp. 484-5] After the murder of the Wahhabi agent in 'Oman, the Na'im tribe of Baraimi, who had suffered much from his tyranny, were inclined to shake off the Wahhabi yoke altogether and applied to 'Azzan for his assistance. 'Azzan immediately proceeded in their direction and, in passing through the Batinah district, endeavoured to recruit reinforcements; but the tribesmen generally did not respond to his summons, and the Ghafiris in particular were firm in their refusal to break5 with the Wahhabis. At Barkah 'Azzan had received a letter from the Wahhabi Amir, who called upon him, on the ground of his having assumed the title of Imam, to remit the customary tribute of 'Oman to Riyadh; but, the Khalili having been consulted, it was resolved to ignore this demand. A more threatening communica tion was now received from 'Abdul 'Aziz, a Wahhabi commander who had recently made a successful raid on Sohar and who, from his name, may have been identical with the Wahhabi leader of the attack made upon Sur in 1865. Having been joined by Salih-bin-'Ali with a contingent of 500 men from the Ja'alan district, 'Azzan advanced on Baraimi with a total force of about 1,500 men; took the place, after slight resistance, on or about the 18th of June 1869; and, after installing a garrison under one of his own relations, returned to Masqat. Before leaving Baraimi 'Azzan entered into an alliance with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and under took to pay him a subsidy on condition of his protecting the Baraimi frontier of 'Oman. A counter-alliance was formed by the remaining Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman among themselves; but the Shaikh of Sharjah quickly forsook it and attached himself to the interests of 'Azzan. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf, on hearing of the capture of Baraimi, inability of hastened to remind the Wahhabi Amir of the obligation under which he had placed th&lt; r Wah l iabl himself in 1866 to abstain from molesting Arab States in alliance with the British Government; but his letter was apparently ignored, and 'Azzan presently received isyo. a laconic warning from 'Abdullah-bin-Faisal to prepare for an invasion of 'Oman by the Amir in person at the head of 20,000 men. At the beginning of 1870 it seemed probable that the threat would be carried into effect; for the Wahhabi chief was then at 'Oqair on the coast of Hasa and had ordered a large fleet of boats to be made ready, which he probably intended to use as transports for a part of his force. Meanwhile, at the end of February, 'Azzan, accompanied by his own brother Ibrahim and by Sa'ud, a rebellious brother of the Wahhabi Amir, proceeded to Baraimi and conferred there with his ally the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Various obstacles now interposed, which obliged the Wahhabi to defer his operations against 'Oman: among them were the unseasonable scarcity of water and forage in the country between Hasa and Baraimi, the combination between the Abu Dhabi Shaikh and the ruler of 'Oman, the prospect of being himself called to account by the British power in connexion with the recent invasion of Bahrain from Hasa, and the fear of intrigue at Riyadh during his absence. Before long 'Abdullah was involved in civil war at home, and he found no further opportunity of prosecuting his designs on 'Oman. 485336 HISTORY OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN* [pp. 630-755] Relations of the Portu guese with the coast of 'Oman between Khor Quwai and Ras-al- Khaimah. 1600-1750.

The history of the region at the present day known as Trucial 'Oman before the middle of the J8th century is almost entirely lost. PERIOD PRECEDING THE RISE OF PIRACY, 1600-1778. In February 1625, after his defeat off Bandar 'Abbas by the English and the Dutch, the Portuguese commander Ruy Freire de Andrade retired with some of his vessels to an anchorage—probably Khor Quwai—on the opposite Arabian coast, and there established a temporary base; and about the same time the Portuguese authorities seem to have had in view the establishment of a station at Khasab. Eventually Kung became the chief if not the only Portuguese settlement in the Persian Gulf proper, though, from a mandate of the King of Portugal dated 1649, for the strengthening of the ' fortress of Cassapo,' it might perhaps be inferred that a post was also maintained at Khasab. About 1631, in pursuance of measures for recovering Hormnz from the Persians by force, the Portuguese built a fort ' in Julfar,' i.e., near Ras-al-Khaimah; and this may have been the post, just mentioned, which is conjectured to have existed at Khasab. It does not appear that the Arabs of the 'Oman coast were much in evidence in the neighbourhood of Bandar 'Abbas, or anywhere upon the Persian side of the Gulf, before the Afghan invasion of Persia which began in 1720. In the confusion following the overthrow of the Safavi dynasty Shaikh Rashid, probably the ruler of Ras-al-Khaimah, seized Basidu on the island of Qishm and there established a settlement of which the trade seriously affected the customs receipts at Bandar 'Abbas, then shared by the Persians and the English. This led to an English naval expedition in April 1727 against Shaikh Rashid, conducted by Mr. W, H. Draper, the East India Company's Agent at Bandar 'Abbas; the ships employed were the ' Britannia ' frigate, the ' Bengal ' galley, and two Trankis; and the outcome was the recovery from the Shaikh of ' the share of customs due to the East India Company.' In 1737, when a Persian force landed at Khor Fakkan and began to overrun the territories of the Imam of 'Oman, the Arabs of Ras-al-Khaimah appear to have made submission to the Persian commander; but in 1741, the Persian occupation of the Imamate still continuing, the Arabs came under suspicion of intending plunder of Bandar 'Abbas, in concert with the Imam, after seizing an island in the vicinity. Very little is known of the internal condition even towards the end of the 18th century of the region now styled Trucial 'Oman; but it seems clear that neither the Portuguese nor the Persians then retained any hold upon the country, and that the influence of the Qasimi Shaikh, whose capital at this time was Ras-al-Khaimah town, greatly predominated over that of his neighbours. The subjects of the Qasimi, to whatever tribes they might belong, were generally spoken of as Qawasim; and it seems possible that, abroad, the name was applied to almost * The chief general authorities for the history of Trucial 'Oman are Bombay Selections, XXIV, 1856; Mr. J. A. Saldanha's Precis of Correspondence regarding the Affairs of the Persian Gulf, 1801-53, printed in 1906, supplementing the last in various important respects; Mr. J. A. Saldanha's Precis of Correspondence regarding the Trucial Chiefs, 1854-1905, also published in 1906; and the annual Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency. Buckingham in his Travels in Assyria, Media and Persia, 1829, gives a valuable and independent account of the piracies of the Qawasim; and Low's History of the Indian Navy, 1877, contains full information relative to all British naval or combined land and sea operations affecting Trucial 'Oman. Some additional facts relating to the Qasimi pirates will be found in Morier's Journey through Persia, 1812, and in Mignan's Winter Journey, 1839. For early times (1600-1800) the authorities are, generally, those cited in the footnote to the title of Chapter First of this volume. For revision of the recent history of the tract, and for much supplementary information regarding the same, the writer is indebted to Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, who was assisted in his enquiries by Khan Bahadur 'Abdul LatTf, Residency Agent at Sharjah. Interesting extracts from the Regimental Records of the 65th Foot were kindly supplied by Captain T. D. Parkinson, Adjutant, 1st York and Lancaster Regiment; and the writer is also indebted to Major H. G. Purdon and to Captain J. B. Wall (?) Adjutant, of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment.4? all Arabs hailing from the western coast of the 'Oman promontory. It was the decline of the Persian influence in the Gulf after the death of Nadir Shah that in the end brought the Qawasim upon the general scene. From their first appearance abroad their energy was directed to exploiting the nearer parts of the Persian coast and to promoting or opposing the policy of their neighbour, the Imam of 'Oman, as their interests at the moment might happen to dictate. On the decease of Nadir Shah in 1747, Mulla 'Ali Shah, who under the late sovereign had been Governor of Bandar 'Abbas and its dependencies and Darya Baigi or Admiral of the Persian Gulf, finding himself pressed with demands for tribute from more than one quarter and threatened by Nasir Khan, the hereditary ruler of Lar, secured the aid ot the Qawasim, with whose Shaikh—apparently Rashid-bin-Matar—he seems to have allied himself by giving him a daughter in marriage. In 1758 Mulla 'Ali Shah with vessels from Hormuz, came to the assistance ot the Qasimi Shaikh against the Imam of Masqat 5 but no actual collision occurred between the opposing forces. In 1759, as related in the chapter on the General History ot the Gult, the crews of some Arab vessels, subjects of the Qasimi Shaikh, who were supposed to be cruising against Mir Mahanna, the piratical chieltain of Rig at the northern end of the Gulf, created a disturbance at Bandar 'Abbas and inflicted serious injuries on the servants of the British Agency there, for which no reparation was afforded by the Persian Deputy-Governor of the place. In June 1760 the Qawasim, who appear in the meantime to have obtained a footing at Qishm and Laft on the island of Qishm and also at Lingeh and Shanas on the coast of the mainland to the westwards, assisted Mulla 'Ali Shah to seize the town of Bandar 'Abbas; but, being unable to dislodge a garrison which held the fort for the Khan of Lar, they again withdrew; on this occasion their strength was estimated at 1,000 men, and they were commanded by Shaikh Rashid in person. The Khan of Lar replied with demonstrations against Lingeh and Ras-al-Khaimah, but he found both places too strong and too well prepared to be seriously attacked; he succeeded, however, in devastating the island of Qishm. In 1761 Mulla 'Ali Shah brought over the Arabs of Ras-al-Khaimah to help him in an attack on Hormuz, where his family were kept prisoners in the fort by the inhabitants of the place and by the Bani Ma'in Arabs; two assaults were made, but both failed. In the course of these disturbances vessel from Masqat, carrying 2,400 bags of rice and a ' Leaguer of Arrack ' for the British Factory at Bandar 'Abbas, was seized by the Qawasim, and the rice was appropriated by Mulla 'Ali Shah, who seems, however, to have made restitution. Early in 1763 a tripartite peace was arranged between the Bani Ma'in on the one side and the Qawasim and Mulla 'Ali Shah on the other; among the conditions were the definite assignment to the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah of a ship named the ^ Rahmani,' of which he had taken possession, and an equal division of the revenues of Qishm Island among the parties. Karlm Khan, Zand, in establishing his power over the south of Persia appointed Shaikh 'Abdullah of the local tribe or family of the Bani Ma'in to be ruler over Bandar 'Abbas, Hormuz and Qishm; and this Shaikh succeeded about 1765, in expelling the Qawasim and other intruders from his dominions, and was able during his lifetime to keep them at a distance. . , th e ^ r expulsion from Persia the Qawasim had generally been at war with the Imam Ahmad of 'Oman, who apparently claimed, yet was unable to entorce, a species of suzerainty over them. Afterwards, when the policy of Karim Khan appeared to threaten the independence of the Arabian littoral generallv they formed a temporary alliance with the Imam; and in 1773 two Persian aallivats belonging to Bandar 'Abbas were destroyed by the 'Omani fleet, assisted^by that J vl 6 H° rmGz Shaikh, the Masqat vessels retiring thereafter to Ras -al-Khaimah. In 17/5, however, the Qasimi Shaikh and the Imam were again at war between themselves; and the Shaikh, relying on his personal resources alone did not scruple to seize Bushehr vessels on the plea that the cargoes belonged to subjects of the Imam. In 1870 their relations were still hostile. In or about 1777 Shaikh Rashid resigned the headship of the Qawasim in tavour of his son Saqar, and the latter sought escape from the extreme isolation of his position by marrying a daughter of Shaikh 'Abdullah of Oishm and so adjusting his differences with the Ma'lni family.

In the years 1779 and 1780 the whole Gulf was in a state of turmoil owing to the non -existence of any controlling power; and the contest between the Oasimi Shaikh and the Imam, resumed after a short interval during which the Oawasim had addicted themselves to mercantile pursuits, contributing largely to Che prevailing confusion. The Qasimi fleet, manned by ruffians who depended on Diracv for their livelihood, scoured the seas plundering all indiscriminately; and their successful example soon found imitators in every Arab port. Towards the end of 1778 the Qawasim captured a vessel oelonging to the East India Company on its way from Bombay to Basrah, and sold the crew and passengers hs slaves ' and in 1779 they seem to have been in possession ot a ship named the ' Expedition ' belonging to the Shaikh of Bushehr, which they declined to restore. In 1782'the Shaikh of the Qawasim, after mediating unsuccessfully between the TJtub and the Persian claimants of Bahrain, took part with a contingent of his subjects in the unsuccessful assault by the Persians on the Atbi stronghold of Zubarah' his attitude on this occasion appears to have been determined by a recent outrage on the part of the 'Utub, who had captured a boat belonging to his Shaikhdom and put 18 ot the crew to death. About 1783 Ibn-Rahmah, a Shaikh of the Pirate Coast—as the modern Trucial 'Oman may most appropriately be styled at this time—made a serious attack on Rustaq, then the capital of the Imam of ;Oman; but the identity of the chief cannot now be fixed* nor the significance of his raid ascertained. j r Some years of peace followed, during which nothing was heard oi the Oawasim; but in 1797 a state of war again prevailed between Masqat and Ras- al-Khaimah and hostilities had been declared between the Imam of Oman and the Government of Persia— circumstances which may have conduced 10 the commission in this year of two remarkable and unprovoked outrages by the Qawasim.Je ^ of M 1797j off R ams , a fleet of Qasimi boats attacked and captured the snow ' Bassein though under British colours and carrying public despatches, and took her to Ras-al-Khaimah, where she was detainee for two days and then released by order of the Shaikh. No reparation seems to have been exacted for this insult to the British flag. . Impunity bore its natural fruit. In the month of October following a fleet of Qawasim, commanded by Salih, a nephew of the Qasimi Shaikh, were &gt;ing in the harbour of Bushehr, their purpose being to intercept some Sun vessels returning from Basrah, and were granted, on the request of the representative ot the Indian Government, at Bushehr, a supply of powder and cannon shot trom the H.E.I. Company's brig 'Viper' of 14 guns; haying received it they treacherously and without warning attacked the Viper at anc w ^ * crew were at breakfast on deck. The ' Viper,' with great promptitude slipped her cable and made sail to escape being boarded; and, in the engagement wnicn followed, she not only beat off her assailants but succeeded in chasing them out to sea; her gallant commander. Lieutenant Carruthers, was killed, and among a crew of 65, all told, there were no less than 32 casualties. Once more the authors of the outrage were suffered to escape without punishment. The were apparently satisfied by an assurance received from the Qasimi Sheikn, tna he had the highest regard for the British nation but exercised no contr ^. 0 i y^ Shaikh Salih, who ' had proceeded to the Persian shore and there estabiisnea ' himself among the Bani Khalid Arabs, marrying a woman of that tribe wmc ' was one of a villainous nature and character; ' and no exception appears to nave been taken even to a statement by the Shaikh that the Viper ' had been the ti to fire. * It may have been Shaikh Saqar of Ras-al-Khaimah, whose great -great-grandfather's name was Rahmah. , . £ ^ ^ ,r.r.i^nK t Mr. F. Warden, Member of Council at Bombay, gives another explanation of these inciacius (see Bombay Records, XXIV, pp. 57 and 302); but his two suggestions, (1) that the Britisn nau previously failed to observe neutrality in the Gulf and (2) that the conduct of the Qawasirn from a contest between the Tman Sa'id of 'Oman and his brother Sultan, appear to be equ unfounded.9 In 1798 Saiyid Sultan of 'Oman made peace with the Qawasim in order to facilitate the enforcement of certain claims which he had against the Turkish authorities at Basrah; with the settlement of the Turko-'Oman dispute there was a return to the normal state of warfare between the two Arab powers, and Saiyid Sultan made a naval attack, which was beaten off, on the Qasimi seaport of Dibah. In 1799 an attempt on Sohar was made by the Na'im and Bani Qitab tribes, assisted by Bani Yas from Dibai; but the invaders were defeated at Liwa, with great loss, by the Saiyids Sultan and Qais of 'Oman. In 1880, as related in the history of the 'Oman Sultanate, an advanced force of the Wahhabis, who had lately annexed the oases of Hasa and Qatif, arrived in Baraimi. The leader of the expedition immediately took measures for a permanent occupation of the place, which he must have seen to be admirably adapted for controlling all western 'Oman, and succeeded in attracting some of the neighbouring Bedouin tribes to his standard; and the ruler of Masqat and the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah—though they sunk for the moment their hereditary differences, consulted together, and even tried conclusions with the newcomers in the field—were unable to rid themselves of their presence. The wilder tribes of 'Oman continued to flock to the standard of the Wahhabi invaders, and, by the middle of 1802, the whole eastern coast of Arabia from the neighbourhood of Basrah to Dibah in the Gulf of 'Oman was reported to acknowledge their authority. In 1803 the Qawasim, under pressure from their Wahhabi masters, took the sea against their late ally, Saiyid Sultan; and they probably had their share in a raid on the island of Qishm, then a dependency of Masqat, which was ravaged in the same year at the instigation of the Wahhabis. Relations with Masqat, 1798-99. Establish ment of ths Wahhabis in 'Oman, 1800-03. Increase of Piracy, 1804-05. The establishment of the Wahhabis at Baraimi was followed by an increase Alleged of piracy and lawlessness at sea, which in India was ascribed chiefly to their Qf S f h 0 e nslblllty influence; but a dispassionate study of the facts, after the laps of more than a wahhabis hundred years, by no means confirms the extreme contemporary view that the Qawasim, in the incidents which now took place, were mere unwilling instruments in the hands of the Wahhabis. The natural character of the Qawasim, as proclaimed by their conduct in 1778-79 and 1797, and the policy of the Bombay Government, which will shortly appear from the sequel, were such that it appears almost superfluous to search for any further explanation of events in the working of Wahhabi influences; and it must be remembered that force majeure on the part of the Wahhabis afforded a convenient and unverifiable excuse for acts which nothing could justify. In 1804 a number of English gentlemen and Indian British subjects, who had The 'Fly' been captured by a French privateer* and released at Bushehr, were making the case ' 1804 - passage from that place to Bombay in a native vessel, when, between Tunb Island and Ras Musandam, they were captured by Qasimi pirates after a resistance in which several of their number were wounded. Some of the party had belonged to the H.E.I. Company's cruiser ' Fly ', which, on being pursued by the French vessel, had been run ashore on Qais Island, the treasure and despatches that she carried being at the same time thrown overboard in shallow water; and on their way down the Gulf the travellers had made shift to recover the ' Fly's ' despatches, but had been obliged to leave the treasure behind. Finding that they were held prisoners at Ras-al-Khaimah without hope of release, they volunteered, on condition of receiving their liberty, to enable the Qawasim to recover the sunken treasure of the ' Fly ', which they did; but the Arabs then proceeded to a general massacre of the inhabitants of Qais and afterwards departed, leaving the released prisoners to their fate upon the deserted island. In the end, out of a once numerous company, only two—Mr. Jowl or Yowl, an officer of the mercantile marine, and a seaman named Fennel—survived to reach Bombay and deliver the carefully preserved despatches of the 'Fly'; the rest mostly perished between Qais and Bushehr, some by shipwreck and others from the hardships of the way. The death of Saiyid Sultan of Masqat at the hands of the Qawasim in 1804 is related in another place. * This ship was ' La Fortune ' of 38 guns. Captain Surcouff, afterwards taken by H.M.S. ' Concorde '.10 Capture of the ' Shannon and ' Trimmer. 1805. Attack on the ' Morning- ton.' 1805. In 1805 two English trading brigs, the ' Shannon Captain Babcock, and the 'Trimmer', Captain Cummings, both belonging to Mr. Manesty, the H.E.I. Company's Resident at Basrah, were attacked by pirates in the neighbourhood of Farur Island and taken after a slight resistance. The Indian members of the crews were put to death; and Captain Babcock, having been seen to fire a musket in the fray, was condemned to lose his arm, which was accordingly struck off with a single blow of a sword. The European prisoners were then conveyed to the Arabian coast, from which in course of time they succeeded in making their escape. Subsequent enquiry showed that the ' Shannon ' had fallen to the Qawasim of Lingeh, while the ' Trimmer ' had passed into the possession of those of Ras-al- Khaimah; and both were at once converted by the captors into vessels of war and were regularly employed in piracy. Mr. Manesty, conceiving that the Wahhabi Amir had power to order the release of his property, sent an agent to wait upon him at his capital of Dara'iyah; but nothing resulted from this mission. In the same year a fleet of 40 Qasimi vessels surrounded the H.E.I. Company 's cruiser ' Mornington ', of 22 guns, and tried to capture her, but the attack failed, and the assailants had reason to regret the encounter. First British expedition against the Qawasim, 1805. Policy of the Bombay Government. Coercive measures adopted. March 1805. Blockade of the Qasimi fleet at Qishm, July 1805. Up to the point that we have now reached, the Government of Bombay had manifested towards the pirates a degree of forbearance which, in the light both of earlier and of later events, it is difficult to understand. It appears to have been a standing order of that Government that none of their vessels in the Gulf should fire until they had been fired upon,—a rule which placed their small and isolated cruisers at a dangerous disadvantage in dealing with an enemy whose favourite method of attack was by boarding; and offenders against this regulation were liable to heavy punishment. On one occasion Lieutenant Gowan of the ' Fury,' 6 guns, having beaten off a number of boats which closed in upon him with hostile intent during a calm, received on arrival at Bombay a severe reprimand from the Governor in person for ' daring to molest the innocent and unoffending Arabs of these seas.'* In March 1805, however, at the suggestion apparently of Captain David Seton, who had been sent to Masqat as Resident for the second time in consequence of the death of Saiyid Sultan, Government determined to assist the ruler of Masqat in chastising the Qawasim ;t but the decision was hedged about by so many conditions and qualifications as to render it almost impossible of execution. Captain Seaton was to refrain from action altogether unless satisfied that the Wahhabi Amir would not take offence at the coercive measures to be employed; in his proceedings towards the pirates, even, he was ' to act with the greatest moderation ' and ' to aim at pacification by means of negotiation '; and he was to avoid all possible complications with the Governments of Turkey and Persia. A further difficulty was created by his being required to conduct his proceedings in consonance with the ideas of Mr. Manesty, Resident at Basrah, and also with those of Lieutenant Bruce, Resident at Bushehr. In the event Captain Seton, who sailed from Masqat in the ' Mornington' on the 28th of May 1805, unfortunately allowed himself, before taking steps against the Qawasim, to be drawn into thinly-veiled co-operation with Saiyid Badar against the Ma'ini possessors of Bandar 'Abbas,—a proceeding against which the Persian authorities afterwards protested as an act of hostility against themselves; but before their protest had time to take effect Captain Seton found an opportunity for a partial reckoning with the Qawasim. On the 15th of June the Anglo-'Omani squadron, on a report that a Qasimi fleet had arrived there, moved over to Qishm town; but the rumour proved to be incorrect, and, as the Qawasim were in too great force on shore to be attacked by landing parties, the ships returned to their former station. At daybreak on * These are the allegations of the journalist Buckingham, but they have been adopted by Low, the historian of the Indian Navy. Some allowance must be made for the strongly anti-official tendencies of Buckingham, who was subsequently deported from India because of his attacks upon the Government of the day. t There was chronic hostility, as we have seen, between the Qawasim and Masqat; and at this time it was specially incumbent on the ruler of Masqat to take steps for avenging the death of his immediate predecessor, Saiyid Sultan, who had been slain by the Qawasim.11 the 5th of July, however, a flotilla of 30 Qasimi boats carrying about 1,000 men entered the Qishm roadstead; and here Captain Seton and Saiyid Badar immediately blockaded them. In the negotiations that followed the part of intermediary was assumed by Preliminary Mulla Husain, Shaikh of Qishm. Captain Seton in the first place required that negotiations, the losses suffered by British shipping should be made good by the Qawasim; but, as they assured him that they could not pay more than Rs. 10,000, and such a sum only by instalments, the question of an indemnity was dropped. Eventually it was arranged that, if the ' Trimmer ' were returned to Captain Seton at Masqat in 25 days, along with a letter for the Governor of Bombay expressing the penitence of the Qawasim, their inability to pay an indemnity, and their resolve to abstain from piracy in the future, a truce should be observed until the Governor's pleasure was known; and that, if the Governor considered the settlement satisfactory, the ' Trimmer ' should be retained by Government and peace declared. Mulla Husain was anxious that Captain Seton should have a personal interview on shore with Sultan-bin-Saqar, Shaikh of Qawasim, who was present; but Captain Seton avoided compliance with this wish as he learned that further conditions, to enable the Qawasim to visit India, would be pressed upon his acceptance. Saiyid Badar was anxious to return to Masqat, and it is possible that his impatience may have prejudiced the negotiations; on his part he was satisfied with a truce of 70 days, after which he intended, according to his own statement, to requite the Qawasim for the death of Saiyid Sultan and to expel them entirely from Qishm and the other parts of his Persian fief. While the Masqat fleet was before Bandar 'Abbas the Qawasim appear to have attempted a diversion by means of maritime raids on Sur and Gwadar. Eventually, in October 1805, an agent from Mulla Husain of Qishm arrived Further at Masqat to negotiate on behalf of the Qawasim, and Captain Seton applied for negotiations, the instructions of the Bombay Government; these, when received, were to the 0c,;ober l 805 * effect that any peace to which the Government became a party should be of a universal character, extending to the whole Gulf, and that full indemnification for past losses must in any case be required. First British treaty with the Qawasim, 1806. The enforcement of these extensive demands, so disproportionate to the impression which had as yet been made on the minds of the Gulf Arabs, having proved impossible without recourse to hostilities on a large scale, a modest treaty was signed by Captain Seton at Bandar 'Abbas on the 6th of February 1806 and was confirmed by the Governor-General of India on the 29th of April following. By this document peace was established, the Qawasim binding themselves under a penalty of $30,000 to observe the same; the 'Trimmer', which had been brought to Masqat, was restored, all claims to the cargo, guns, etc., of that vessel and of the 'Shannon' being however waived by the British Government; the Qawasim undertook to assist British vessels visiting, or driven upon, their shores, and promised to give three months' notice before infringing the peace, should they find themselves compelled to do so at the behest of the Wahhabi Amir; finally in case of the treaty being ratified, as it was shortly after, the tribe were' to be at liberty, as before, to frequent the ports of India. The Wahhabi Amir was not consulted in the negotiations. Before the execution of the treaty the ' Shannon ' had already been returned in a dismantled state. Temporary cessation of piracy, 1806-1808. For fully two years from the signature of this peace the Qawasim remained Large quiescent, abstaining at least from offences against British trade and vessels. It British fleet is not improbable that their good intentions, recorded in the treaty of 1806, were in the Gulf ' confirmed by the presence in the Gulf during 1807 of a fleet of no less than eight l807 ' of the H.E.I. Company's cruisers. These ships were originally sent in company with H.M.S. Fox ' to threaten Basrah, in consequence of hostilities in Europe between Britain and Turkey; but, instead of being withdrawn on the conclusion of this service, they were left on duty in the Gulf for about a year. 4853312 Tribal wars of the Qawasim. etc., 1806- 1808. Deposition the Qasimi Shaikh by the Wahhabi Amir. 1808. In other directions, however, the turbulence of the Qawasim was not altogether suspended. In 1806 some of the Qawasim espoused the side of Saiyid Qais of Sohar in his contest with Saiyid Badar of Masqat for the mastery of 'Oman, but they did not do so with sufficient force to prevent his being worsted by Badar. A spirited movement by which the Qasimi Shaikh, Sultan-bin-Saqar, recovered Khor Fakkan from the 'Omani Saiyids Sa'id and Qais in May 1808 is described in the history of the 'Oman Sultanate. His exploit at Khor Fakkan must have been one of the last public acts of Sultan-bin-Saqar at this time, for within the next few months he was deprived, under orders from the Wahhabi Amir, of his general headship over the Qawasim. He retained at first independent authority in his own port of Ras-al-Khaimah; but in the following year (1809) even this was taken from him; Husain-bin-'Ali, Shaikh of Rams/was nominated governor and tax-collector on behalf of the Wahhabis over most of what is now Trucial 'Oman, including Ras-al-Khaimah; and other Wahhabi officers were appointed to the smaller sub-divisions of the country. The Wahhabis also possessed themselves of the forts of Fujairah, Bithnah, and Khor Fakkan in Shamailiyah. Attack on the ' Lively,' 1808. Capture of the ' Minerva,' 1808. Capture and re-capture of the cruiser ' Sylph,' 1808. Revival of piracy, 1808-1809. Apparently before the removal of Shaikh Sultan from the Qasimi Shaikhship the predatory instincts of his tribe had broken forth once more upon the high seas and the 'treaty of 1806 had been violated. This breach of their engagements was the more notorious that it was committed off the coast oi India. In April 1808, off the coast of Gujarat, the schooner 'Lively,' Lieutenant Macdonald, was hemmed in by 4 Arab vessels, each larger and carrying more men than herself, and an attempt was made by the enemy to board her; but it was repulsed by the determined fire of the ' Lively,' which did great execution. Three of the pirate craft which took part in this affair were subsequently discovered at Surat and were taken to Bombay; but, though wounded men were found concealed on board and the identification in other respects appeared to be complete, the Government, ' in consideration of their long detention, set them free again to exercise their calling on some hapless coaster.' This they, or others resembling them, seem to have done with effect; for, in the course of 1808, no less than 20 country vessels fell a prey to Arab buccaneers off the Indian coast. About September 1808 the 'Minerva,' Captain Hopwood, another trading ship belonging to Mr. Manesty of Basrah, was captured by boarders from a number of Qasimi boats, which had maintained a running fight with her during several successive days. The majority of the occupants were, it was said, put to a cruel death by methods indicative of religious fanaticism; but the lives of the second mate and carpenter and of an Armenian lady, wife of Lieutenant Taylor, Assistant Resident at Bushehr, were spared, and they were carried prisoners to Ras-al- Khaimah. Mrs. Taylor was successfully ransomed a few months later by Lieutenant Bruce, the Resident at Btishehr, but her two less fortunate companions never, apparently, regained their liberty. On the 21st of October 1808, a few weeks after the mishap to the ' Minerva,' the H.E.I. Company's cruiser ' Sylph ' of only 78 tons, mounting 8 guns, was approached by a fleet of large Arab vessels; she had been accidentally separated from the squadron which carried Sir Harford Jones and the members of his Mission to Persia; and Muhammad Husain Khan, one of the Persian secretaries attached to the Mission, was actually on board of her at the time. Precluded by regulation from using her guns until it was too late, the tiny vessel fell an easy prey to the crowd of boarders which the Arab ships hurled on her deck from their towering bows; and a wholesale massacre of her crew, who perished fighting desperately, was the sequel. Among the few survivors of the action were the commander. Lieutenant Graham, who fell, covered with wounds, down the fore hatchway, and the Persian secretary, who hid himself in a cabin-locker. The lives of the remnant were saved by the sudden appearance on the scene of H.M.S. ' Nereide,' Commodore Corbett, a frigate of 36 guns, at the sight of which the Qawasim took flight in their own vessels abandoning the ' Sylph,' and were pursued for some distance by the ' Nereide,' but without success.* * The statement of Sir H. J. Brydges in his Brief History of the Wahauby (page 36), that the ' Nereide ' sank three of the pirate vessels, is not accepted by Low, the historian of the Indian Navy. See also a quotation from the log-book of the ' Nercide ' at page 46 of Morier's Journey through Persia,'Z 13 Only three days after the 'Sylph' incident the H.E.I. Company's brig Attack on 'Nautilus' of 14 guns, Lieutenant Bennett, was threatened, while passing the J^autilifs' island of Hanjam, by a squadron of two large and two small pirate vessels. In 18 q J | u 1 us ' consequence of the order which prohibited British ships from taking the initiative in these affairs. Lieutenant Bennett considered himself obliged to hold his tire until the hostile squadron had advanced so near that the war dances and brandished spears of the Arab crews could be distinctly seen and their songs and shouts heard; he then hoisted the British colours and fired two shots across their bows. As they still continued to approach, the ' Nautilus ' immediately discharged a broadside at the two larger vessels; and a gunnery combat ensued which was maintained for nearly an hour. At length the Arab squadron took to flight, pursued by the ' Nautilus,' who plied them with her shot as long as they were within range. Second British expedition against the Qawasim, 1809-10. The insolence of the Qawasim and their power for mischief had now reached such a point that they could no longer be ignored; and the spirit of the tribe was clearly shown in a demand, made by the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah about this time, that the Government of Bombay should pay tribute for the privilege, which he would accord to their ships, of navigating the Persian Gulf in safety. The Qasimi sailing craft were estimated to amount to 63 large and 813 smaller vessels, and the crews to aggregate nearly 19,000 men. The outbreak of piracy in 1808 was attributed, like the same phenomenon in 1805, to Wahhabi influence; but the indications of this, though more substantial than on the former occasion, could still hardly be called conclusive. Husain- bin-'Ali of Rams had, it is true, visited the capital of the Wahhabis before becoming their representative in the Qasimi country; and there were rumours of an engage ment on his part that one-fifth of the proceeds of piracies should be paid to The Wahhabi Amir in accordance with Wahhabi practice in such matters. The piracies on the Indian coast were considered by Captain Seton to be due to Wahhabi instigation; and, whether his belief were well-founded or no, it was undeniable that the recent outrages coincided very closely in time with the supersession of the hereditary Shaikh of the Qawasim by a Wahhabi officer. In 1908 the deposed Qasimi Shaikh, Sultan-bin-Saqar, was decoyed by the Wahhabis to their capital, Dara'iyah, and there detained; but he eventually escaped, by way of Yaman and the port of Mokha, to Masqat, where he was kindly received by Saiyid Sa'id, the ruler. Meanwhile a demand had been addressed to the Qawasim by the Wahhabi Amir, that they should join the 'Utub in a naval expedition against Kuwait and Basrah; and with this requisition they seem to have complied, or at least to have professed their willingness to comply. On the coast of Persia, in 1809, the Qawasim sustained a check, being driven out of Lingeh and Charak by a Persian force from Lar and compelled to retire to Basidu on Qishm Island; it is probable, however, that this reverse was of very short duration, for a British armament a few months later destroyed Lingeh on the ground of its being a Qasimi town. The Qawasim about the same time sent 22 boats to the relief of Rahmah-bin-Jabir. a pirate of Khor Hassan in Qatar, when he was attacked by a Persian expedition from Bushehr; and so effectual was their co-operation that the Bushehr flotilla was repulsed and six of the vessels belonging to it were captured. Perhaps the last victim of Qasimi rapacity during this period was the ' Deria Dowlut,' Captain Flemming, which seems to have been taken in June 1809; while in October of the same year a boat from H.M.S. ' Caroline,' commanded by Lieutenant Wood, boarded and captured one of a fleet of 27 piratical vessels. A naval demonstration was made by Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat against the Qasimi ports, but it was wholly ineffectual. In these circumstances a naval and military expedition was sanctioned by the Governor-General of India, of which the principal object was to destroy completely the sea power of the piratical tribes at that day denominated ' Qawasim,' and to release British subjects and others who might be held by them in bondage; but there was also an intention of replacing Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat in possession of certain places in the Gulf of 'Oman, of which he had been deprived by the Qasimis. The 'Oman Sultanate was at that time threatened with invasion by the Wahhabi general Mutlaq, whose headquarters were at Baraimi; and a desire to relieve the ruler of Masqat from this danger has also been mentioned as among the motives Temerity and strength of the Qawasim.

Strength and organisation of the expedition. The voyage. of the expedition.* A conciliatory convention was, if possible, to be arranged with the piratical powers after the destruction of their vessels. Incidentally topographical information regarding the country, and especially the ports, of the Qawasim was to be procured; and an ' eligible island ' was to be sought for in the vicinity of the Qasimi coast, which it might be possible to occupy as a maritime station or a Residency. The instructions issued to the naval and military commanders in charge of the expedition placed all these objects before them for attainment, except that relating to the relief of Masqat from Wahhabi pressure; this last, if it entered into the scheme at all, was apparently viewed as an indirect consequence, with which executive officers were not concerned. Special stress was laid upon the complete destruction of all piratical craft. From the political point of view extreme caution was enjoined. Land operations of every sort were to be avoided, so far as possible, and especially any conflict with forces in the service of the Wahhabi Amir; no hostility towards the Wahhabis was to be expressed; and the supposed connection of the Wahhabis with the Qawasim was to be ignored, the latter being treated for all purposes as an independent power, t The susceptibilities of the Persian and Turkish Governments were to be respected to the utmost, and the local representa tives of the former were to be assured, if necessary, that the operations against the pirates covered no territorial designs. At Laft, though that place was no longer under the control of the Saiyid of Masqat, the Qasimi shipping was not to be destroyed without his express assent. The naval force detailed for the expedition was placed under the command of Commodore J. Wainwright of H.M.S. ' Chiffonne,' 36 guns, and consisted, besides the flagship, of H.M.S. ' Caroline,' 36 guns; and of the H.E.I. Company's cruisers ' Mornington,' 22 guns; 'Ternate,' 16 guns; 'Aurora,' 14 guns; ' Mercury,' 14 guns; ' Nautilus,' 14 guns; ' Prince of Wales,' 14 guns; ' Vestal,' 10 guns; 'Ariel,' 10 guns; 'Fury,' 8 guns; and ' Stromboli,' bomb-ketch. The land force, conveyed in 4 large transports and commanded by Lieutenant- Colonel Lionel Smith of His Majesty's 65th Regiment, amounted to about 1,411 fighting men, of whom 883 were Europeans and 528 natives of India; the European portion was composed of His Majesty's 65th Regiment, the flank companies of His Majesty's 47th Regiment, and a detachment of the Bombay Artillery. + The armament, as a whole, was under the joint command of Captain Wainwright and Colonel Smith. By the death of Captain Seton, Resident at Masqat, a month before it sailed, the expedition was deprived of its political adviser. § Mr. Bunce, who was sent to take Captain Seton's place but probably possessed no local knowledge, was ordered by the Bombay Government to remain at Masqat; he also expirecTbefore the end of the year. The expedition started from Bombay on the 14th of September 1809. Before the ships had been 24 hours out of port the bottom fell out of the ' Stromboli' bomb-ketch, and she foundered, carrying with her an artillery officer, most of her crew, and the main supply of heavy ammunition for the force. Masqat was reached on the 24th of October, and here the expedition was joined by Captain Pasley and other members of Sir John Malcolm's third Mission, then on their way to Persia; these gentlemen ' most handsomely volunteered their services,' which were accepted. Saiyid Sa 'Td, who was in a despondent mood, seemed to regard the smallness of the armament with some dismay in view of the task assigned it; and he did not, apparently, at this stage offer to co-operate. Pilots and small boats for landing were, however, obtained; and on the 2nd November the expedition left Masqat. An offer made by the Shaikh of Kuwait to join the British expedition with his whole naval force and supply pilots for all the piratical strongholds was * See Bombay Selections, XXIV, pages 131 and 305. t In some earlier instructions sent to Captain Seton a sort of explanation to the Wahhabi Amir of the action about to be taken against the Oawasim appears to have been contemplated; see Bombay Selections, XXIV, page 43. The writer has not been able to ascertain whether these earlier instructions were cancelled or executed. X According to Regimental Records there were 638 sepoys and the whole force only numbered about 1,200 men. § Captain David Seton, of the Bombay Military Service, was Resident at Masqat, with two short intervals, from 1800 to 1809. He died of fever at Barkah on the 2nd of August, 1809, and was buried at that place. He was not a careful reader of his instructions, and the repudiation by Government of the treaty which he arranged with the Emirs of Sind in 1808 (vide Kaye's Afghan War) will be remembered; but he seems to have been an earnest and energetic officer, and his death was much regretted.15 declined by Captain Wainwright, who afterwards regretted his action in this respect, for the pilots obtained at Masqat were altogether useless. The expedition arrived off Ras-al-Khaimah on the afternoon of the 11th November; but the shallowness of the soundings made it necessary for the ships to anchor at distances of 2 to 4 miles off the town, according to their size. The captured ' Minerva,'' a full-rigged ship on which the Qawasim had mounted 20 guns, was starting from Ras-al-Khaimah on a cruise when the British squadron arrived; but, on sighting the armament, she put about and ran aground under a circular tower about a mile to the south of the town. In this position she was attacked by the smaller British vessels and taken; but a heavy fire from the shore prevented her removal, and she was burned instead where she lay. In the attempt to cut out the ' Minerva,' the cruiser ' Prince of Wales ' went aground and suffered some damage by a fusillade from the land. On the 12th the town was bombarded during three hours by such of the vessels as from their size could approach near enough; but the defenders maintained an unshaken fire from small batteries and entrenchments thrown up along the beach, and little or no impression was made.* In the early morning of the 13th a demonstration was made against the mouth ol the harbour at the north end of the town, under cover of which the whole of the British infantry and some detachments of marines and native troops were landed at the opposite end, in water reaching to their waists. The landing was disputed by a crowd of swordsmen, but their rush was broken by a fire of case from gunboats, and they were then driven back by a charge. By sunrise the wall across the peninsula on the landward side of the town had been secured, along with its towers and some adjacent buildings. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the centre of the town had been gained, the British flag had been hoisted on the Shaikh's house, and only the northern quarters at the point of the peninsula remained in possession of the enemy. By 4 p.m. 50 vessels belongins to the place, including 30 large war boats, had been set on fire by the seamen of the fleet, and the town had become the scene of a general conflagration. Some booty was obtained by individuals,! but no general plunder was authorised. At daylight on the 14th, in consequence of a report that a large body of Arabs was approaching from the interior. Colonel Smith, actuated doubtless by the instructions to avoid a conflict with the Wahhabis, hurriedly re-embarked his force. No admission of defeat had been obtained from'the enemy, who immediately re-occupied the shore with every gesture of defiance. There is reason to believe that the Wahhabi general Mutlaq did actually move to the assistance of Ras-al-Khaimah as soon as he heard that it was attacked; and, especially in view of what occurred a few weeks later at Shinas, it is imDosible to condemn the cautious behaviour of the British commander. It does not appear that the fighting at Ras-al-Khaimah can have been of a severe character; but some particular buildings were held with obstinacy. The fatal casualties on the British side were two men killed on board the ' Prince of Wales ' and Captain Dansey of the 65th Regiment, slain by a spear, which struck him in the neck while he was clearing a house in the town; the wounded numbered 21. But for the screen formed by the smoke of burning houses, the British losses would, it is said, have been much heavier. In regard to the enemy it was reported that ' from 70 to 80 of these vagabonds were killed.' The landing and embarkation of the troops, in view of the difficulties by which these operations were attended, were considered to have been very successfully performed. The armament then crossed the Gulf to Lingeh, which was deserted by the inhabitants at its arrival; on the 17th the town was occupied without resistance by a small detachment of native troops and given to the flames; and 20 sailing craft, of which 9 were large war vessels, were destroyed. At midday on the 26th of November the cruisers ' Mornington,' ' Ternate ' ' Nautilus ' and ' Fury ' with the transport ' Mary,' having obtained pilots at Qishm town,entered Clarence Strait and anchored off the port of Laft. They carried a force of about 500 land troops, most of whom were Europeans, the Qawasim or their Qishmi allies occupying the place, were summoned to surrender; but Arrival at Ras-al-Khal- mah, 11th November 1809.

About 2 p.m. on the 27th, the garrison being still defiant, 300 men* were landed to storm the fort; but the work proved to be of unexpected strength, and the result was a decided reverse tor the assailants. A 5^-inch howitzer, which had been brought up to force the only entrance, was abandoned in the open under heavy fire; and the attacking force were obliged to take cover behind hillocks and sand ridges, in positions from which they could not even retire until darkness fell. Meanwhile, however, a heavy fire was maintained by the ' Fury ' and some gunboats; and by sunset the fort had b sen seriously shattered. The casualties of the day amounted to 11 killed and 55 wounded, among the killed being an Irish subaltern of the 47th Regiment, Lieutenant S. Weld, who made a gallant attempt to form a party for the recovery of the howitzer. At nightfall an ultimatum was sent to Mulla Husain, who commanded the defence, requiring the evacuation of the fort by 2 a.m.; and daybreak revealed a Union Jack waving on the battlements in the hands of Lieutenant Hall of the Bombay Marine, a survivor of the ' Stromboli,' who had entered the place single-handed by night, a few of the garrison who still lingered there taking flight at his approach. Eleven vessels, captured apparently during the unsuccessful attack on the tort, were burned, and the town, with miscellaneous property to the value of Rs. 2,00,000 12 lakhsl, was delivered over intact to an agent of the ruler of Masqat. On the 7th of December the whole force rendezvoused at the base, which was the roadstead of Barkah near Masqat; and the flank companies of the 47th Regiment and 200 sepoys were sent back to Bombay. In the general destruction of Qasimi shipping small boats not convertible to piratical uses had been spared to avoid exciting unnecessary bitterness. Saiyid Sa'id, whose confidence had revived with the recovery of Laft, was now anxious that the programme of the Bombay Government should be executed in its entirety by the expulsion of the Qawasim from the ports of Shinas and Khor Fakkan on his western seaboard, and it was decided to comply with his wishes. The successful operations which resulted from this decision are described, together with their for the Saiyid disastrous sequel, in the history of the Sultanate of 'Oman. Leaving Shinas, the expedition returned to the Persian Gulf and on the 15th of January 1810 reached Rams, where 10 large vessels were given up to be burned. At Jazirat-at-Hamra, the next place visited, the people at first made a show of resistance; but, learning that the town of Rams had been spared, they eventually surrendered 8 large vessels for destruction. At Sharjah no large vessels in good condition were found. The war fleet of 'Ajman evidently was spared or escaped, for in 1811 we find it cruising the Gulf in company of the pirate Rahmah-bin-Jabir. On the 21st of January the armament, having crossed the Gulf, anchored at Mughu on the Persian coast, and four Sharjah boats found in the anchorage were destroyed. Nakhilu, Charak, Kung and Band Mu'allim were visited, but no large craft were found; a strict warning was addressed, however, to the Shaikhs of the two first-named ports. Before the return of the whole expedition to India, a discussion took place as to the expediency of operations against Rahmah-bin-Tabir, the piratical chief of Qatar, who, with the assistance of the Qawasim, had defeated an attack made on him bv the Persian authorities of Bushehr. His punishment was strongly advocated by Mr. Hankey Smith, the British Resident at Bushehr; but the project was in the end negatived, partly on the ground of Rahmah's neutral and even friendly attitude towards the British power, and partly on that of a close connection which he had recently formed with the Wahhabis. The bulk of the expeditionary force returned to Bombay in February 1810; but a portion was detained in the Gulf until the question of Rahmah's punishment had been settled, and did not reach India till April. As Sultan-bin-Saqar, the legitimate Shaikh of the Qawasim, was still at this time an exile without authority over his tribe, while the Qawasim themselves as yet remained in strict if not voluntary subjection to the Wahhabi agents set over them, no attempt was made to arrange the conciliatory convention which it had been one of the objects of the Bombay Government to bring about. Regard being had to the somewhat inconclusive end of the military operations at Ras-al-Khaimah, it is probable that no satisfactory arrangements could have been attained at this time without further coercion. An impression nevertheless prevailed among British * Viz., a light company of the 47th. half a company of the 65th, a detachment of the 2nd Native Infantry and some seamen and marines.17 officials that the danger from the Qawasim was practically at an end; and discussion was limited to proposals for preventing its recrudescence. Mr. Manesty, the Resident at Basrah, advised that an embargo should be laid by Government on the exportation of timber from India to Masqat and the ports of the Persian Gulf; and his suggestion, which was supported by General Malcolm, British Envoy to Persia, was adopted, but proved futile.* To the Wahhabi Amir a letter would seem to have been addressed, requesting that potentate to prohibit piracy by his dependents; and he in his reply, which was dignified but somewhat sarcastic in tone, appears to have stated that he had no cause to quarrel with Christians and that he had interdicted his followers from molesting British vessels.t The ' distinguished zeal, prudence, promptitude and ability ' with which the operations generally had been conducted by Captain Wainwright and Colonel Smith! were highly commended by the Governor-General of India in Council. Renewed trouble with the Qawasim, 1811-1819. During the remainder of 1810 and throughout the year 1811, the H.E.I. Company's cruisers ' Benares ' and ' Prince of Wales ' being for part of that time employed in the Gulf, there was a complete cessation of piracy; but in 1812 the Qawasim showed signs of returning to their nefarious practices. In 1813 several large cratt belonging to Kangu and Basrah fell into their hands, while some Indian trading vessels under the British flag were plundered by them, and others lay in enforced idleness at Porbandar not venturing to put to sea. The possibility of a renewed outbreak such as occurred is partially explained by the unsurveyed state of the Persian Gulf, in consequence of which a much larger proportion than was supposed of piratical craft had escaped destruction in 1809-10. In 1813, as mentioned § in the history of the 'Oman Sultanate, an expedition was undertaken by Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat against Ras-al-Khaimah, the ostensible object of the same being the restoration of Sultan-bin-Saqar, the legitimate Shaikh of the Oawasim, who promised to exert his influence for the repression of piracy, to his position of authority over the tribe. At the suggestion of the Saiyid and under orders from the Government of Bombay, Lieutenant Bruce, the British Resident at Bushehr, accompanied the 'Omani expedition for the purpose of witnessing the agreement which Sa'id proposed to form with Sultan-bin-Saqar; of arranging with the Qasimi Shaikh, after his restoration, a renewal of the treaty oi 1806; and of concluding new treaties upon similar lines with other Arab powers in the Gulf. The failure from the military point of view of the Saiyid's expedition, notwithstanding help rendered by the Bani Yas tribe of Abu Dhabi, caused the British scheme founded on it to fall to the ground. u t) 0 ^ fresh expedition by Saiyid Said against Ras-al-Khaimah in which the Bam Yas once more assisted, was crowned with partial success, the Qawasim binding themselves by the terms of peace to abstain from aggression upon the inhabitants of either coast of the Gulf of 'Oman and of the Persian Gulf below Bahrain and Kangun, all of whom were to be regarded as subjects of Masqat and to return any booty which might have been taken by their fleets then actuallv at sea; but the engagement was not observed. During the presence of the Saiyid before Ras-al-Khaimah, or very shortly after his departure, a Persian vessel carrying goods from Masqat to Bandar Abbas, a port under his jurisdiction, was attacked by 7 Qfisimi boats and taken after a stout resistance in which many were killed on both sides, and it is not clear that restitution was made even in this case, although it was covered by the terms of the treaty, on which the ink was not yet dry.

Preliminary agreement between the Resident at Bushehr and a Qasimi plenipoten tiary. Octo ber 1814. Immediate break-down of the arrangement. Saiyid Sa'id, before sailing against Ras-ai-Khaimah in 1814, had attempted to enlist the active co-operation of the Bombay Government by claiming the benefits of an offensive and defensive alliance; but this interpretation of existing Anglo-'Omani treaties was at once repudiated by the British authorities. Lieutenant Bruce, however, who had been instructed to proceed to Ras-al-Khaimah in any case and to demand satisfaction for recent injuries by the Qawasim, besides obtaining, if possible, a fresh treaty with the tribe, was authorised to accompany the expedition; but it would seem that either the course of events or the line of policy followed by his associate was such as did not permit of his intervening in the negotiations. , , o • j , , In the accommodation which was arranged the Saiyid appears to have concentrated his attention on obtaining advantages lor himself, and even to have obliged Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar to relinquish in his favour all claims to Ras-al- Khaimah; but it was agreed that the Shaikh should be placed in possession of Sharjah, at which place and at Lingeh he for some time afterwards continued to reside. In August 1814 Sultan -bin-Saqar, who was then at Lingeh and was supposed to be well disposed towards the British Government, sent an agent ol his own to the Court of Shiraz, on a mission of which the nature did not transpire, the only visible result was that, three months later, the Shaiivh received a dress of honour from the Shah of Persia and was requested to co-operate with the Persians in tne reduction of Bahrain. . , The Resident at Bushehr had for some time been in correspondence with Hasan-bin-Rahmah, de facto Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, in regaid to depredations committed by the Qawasim on the coast of India; and in the meanwhile the ship 'Ahmad Shah.' apparently containing remounts for the East India Company, had been taken by the Shaikh of Charak near the island of Qais, whence a part of the booty had been carried off to Ras-al-Khaimah in a Qasimi boat. Hasan- bin-Rahmah did not immediately reply to the Resident's first letter but proceeded to Dara'lyah to confer, perhaps on the subject thereof, with Abdullah-bin-Sa ud, the Wahhabi Amir. On his way back to Ras-al-Khaimah Hasan-bin-Ranman despatched from Hasa a certain Hasan-bin -Muhammad-bin-Ghaith with letters from the Shaikh himself and from the Wahhabi Amir for Lieutenant Bruce , this emissary arrived at Bushehr on the 2nd of October 1814. In their epistles the Amir and the Shaikh both denied the commission of offences by the Qawasim against the British flag, but promised the restitution of any property the taking of which could be proved; both requested that the distinction between British subjects and others might be made more plain; and a request was added by the Shaikh that Hasan-bin-Muhammad might be treated as a plenipotentiary empowered on his part to renew the treaty of 1806, and that the past might be regarded with a lenient eye. To increase the attractiveness of these proposals a hope was held out that an Agent would shortly be deputed by Hasan-bin-Rahmah to Bombay for the purpose of negotiating a regular treaty; and, by way ol mollifying the resentment of the British Government, it was verbally explained by the envoy that the incessant naval warfare in which the Qawasim engaged was necessary for the maintenance of their position in the Gulf, and that without it they could not live in safety from their enemies. Lieutenant Bruce and the emissary accordingly signed a preliminary agreement by which it was provided that, in consideration of the Qawasim's respecting British vessels in future, flying a special flag to distinguish them from other maritime Arabs, restoring the Company's property taken from the ' Ahmad Shah,' and fulfilling certain other conditions, the misdeeds of the past should be overlooked and the tribe should be at liberty to visit the ports of British India. On the Resident's part this agreement was entered into subject to the approbation of the Government of Bombay, to whom it was immediately referred. The hollowness of the arrangement was, however, very shortly demonstrated by the seizure, in Ras-al-Khaimah harbour, of a boat in which Lieutenant Bruce, under the orders of Government, had sent friendly letters to the chief and to his envoy, Hasan -bin-Muhammad, regarding the capture off Porbandar in the preceding month of August of some boats under British colours. According to one authority* the wretched envoy himself had, on his return from Bushehr to Ras-al-Khaimah, been subjected to the most degrading treatment because of his concessions to the infidel. * Vide Buckingham, pages 424-425.is. 19 The Oawasim, feeling perhaps how deeply they had committed themselves, now indulged in a carnival of maritime lawlessness, to which even their own previous record presented no parallel. In the Mughu anchorage, with the connivance of the people of Mughu, they captured a Baghlah belonging to Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat which was laden with remounts for His Majesty's 17th Light Dragoons and with sulphur for the British Government. Six native vessels were taken by them off the coast of Sind; and not long afterwards an action was fought off Quryat between one of their fleets, consisting of a ship with 25 Baghlahs and Batlls, and a squadron commanded by Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat in person. In this encounter the Saiyid was wounded, while his flagship the ' Caroline ' was boarded, and, but for an opportune discharge of grape from the poop among the enemy's boarders crowding the forecastle, would probably have been taken. In 1815 a British Indian vessel was captured by the Qawasim near Masqat, the majority of the crew being put to death and the remainder held to ransom. On the 6th of January 1816 the H.E.I. Company's armed pattamar ' Deriah Dowlut,' officered and manned entirely by natives of India, was attacked by Qawasim off Dwarka, and eventually taken by boarding. Out of 38 souls on board, 17 were killed or murdered, 8 were carried prisoners to Ras-al-Khaimah, and the remainder, being wounded, were landed on the Indian coast. The entire armament of the ' Deriah Dowlut'' consisted of two 12-pounder and three 2-pounder iron guns; whereas each of the pirate vessels, three in number, carried six 9-pounders and was manned by 100 to 200 Arabs, fully armed. In the same month a Qasimi squadron composed of 15 vessels, the smallest pulling 20 oars, waylaid the H.E.I. Company's cruiser ' Aurora ' of 14 guns, Captain Jeakes, while convoying down the Persian Gulf a large Baghlah that carried treasure for the ruler of Masqat. Though much incommoded by the Baghlah, which she had in tow, the ' Aurora ' stood on through the middle of the hostile fleet; and in the action which ensued she plied them so hotly with grape and canister that several were sunk, and the remainder at nightfall drew off baffled, and disappeared in the direction of the Arabian coast. Not long after this, the Qawasim pursued and fired at the American ship 'Persia'; attacked the ' Macaulay ' and the 'Cintra'; and even plundered a French schooner on the voyage from Mauritius to Basrah, though convoyed by a ship of the same nationality. A few weeks later several other seizures were achieved by the Qawasim, among them that of a ship under the British flag, of which the name was never ascertained; this vessel was taken by five pirate boats and her crew and passengers were put to the sword. The H.E.I. Company's armed boat 'Turrarow' also fell into the hands of the Qawasim; and on every side their captures and atrocities continued. Matters had now reached such a pitch that Lieutenant Bruce, the Political Resident, could not even obtain a boat to carry a letter of remonstrance to Ras-al-Khaimah; most of the ports on the Persian side to the south of Naband had begun to emulate the Pirate Coast to the best of their ability; the Shaikh of Charak had attached himself to the piratical Qasimi organisation; and 'Abdullah-bin-Ahmad, Shaikh of Bahrain, was reported to have announced his intention of adopting piracy as the shortest road to fortune. Matters were at length brought to a head by the capture in the Red Sea, in 1816, of three Indian merchant vessels from Siirat, which were making the passage to Mokha under the British flag; of the crews only a few survivors remained to tell the tale, and the pecuniary loss was estimated at Rs. 12,00,000. The pirates were commanded on this occasion by Amir Ibrahim, a kinsman of Hasan-bin- Rahmah, the de facto Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. In this new and remote quarter the offences by the Qawasim had their beginning in 1815; and it was probably about this time that, as tradition relates, they made cruel raids at various points along the southern coast of Arabia including the Kuria Muria Islands and Hasik on the mainland, both of which they left virtually depopulated. The circumstances of the outrage upon the Surat vessels took some time to investigate; but in September 1816, as soon as the facts had been made clear. His Majesty's sloop ' Challenger,' 18 guns, and the H.E.I. Company's cruisers ' Mercury ' and ' Vestal,' 14 and 10 guns respectively, sailed from Bombay for the Gulf. The ' Ariel,' already present there, was meanwhile sent to Ras-al-Khaimah to demand an explanation, and returned to Bushehr with a flat denial, on the part of the Qawasim, of their complicity in the Red Sea affair; to this denial were subjoined the further curious justifications, that the Qawasim had promised to respect the lives and property of Christians only, not those of idolatrous Hindus, and that in any case they could not recognise as native subjects 48533 f Numerous fresh outrages by the Qawasim, 1815.

The Resident, Lieutenant Bruce and his Assistant Lieutenant Taylor arrived off Ras-al-Khaimah on the 26th of November with the ' Challenger ' ' Mercury,' ' Vestal' and ' Ariel,' and early the next morning a letter addressed to the Shaikh was conveyed ashore by was not allowed an interview with the chief. A httle later, however, Hasan-bin-Rahmah consented to see Captain Bridges ot the Challenger, w om Mr J S Buckingham, afterwards well-known as a traveller and journalist, accompanied in the capacity of interpreter; and by these gentlemen it was ascertained from the chief personally that he had both received the letter of the Resident and fully understood its contents. In that communication discussion of the principal point, whether the Qawasim were the authors of the crime in the Red Sea or not. was refused; the immediate restoration of the plundered vessels and property or, alternatively, the payment of their value in cash was demanded; the surrender of Amir Ibrahim for punishment was claimed, and it was added that two sons of Shaikhs must be delivered up to the Government of Bombay as hostages for the future behaviour of the tribe. In event of failure to comply with all or any of these terms the squadron, under the instructions received by the Resident, was simply to withdraw after denouncing the displeasure of Government against Qawasim. the answer of the Shaikh, delivered at noon on the 27th, was insolent and evasive; but he was given a further period of 24 hours for consideration, and meanwhile a wind from the north-west arose, which compelled the squadron to weigh anchor and run over for shelter to the coast of Qishm. On the 30th the ships again appeared before Ras -al-Khaimah and a fresh period of grace was allowed ^the Shaikh, terminating at noon on the following day. Hasan -bin-Rahmah continued obstinate and adhered firmly to his own counter proposal, which was that he should be allowed to send envoys to Bombay to settle the matter there On the receipt of this reply the squadron stood in as close to the town as thev could without going aground and opened fire upon four Arab vessels which were anchored close in-shore; but the range, which was fully a mile, was too great for all but a few of their guns; and, though some 350 rounds were fired, no visible execution was done.* The squadron then dispersed, the Mercury and ' Ariel ' being detailed to visit Sharjah, Lingeh and Charak on a mission similar to that performed at Ras-al-Khaimah, while the ' Challenger convoyed the ' Vestal ' out of the Gulf, turning back at Masqat to afford protection to upward- The piratical force of the Qawasim at this period was estimated at 60 large boats belonging to Ras -al-Khaimah, carrying from 80 to 300 men each besides 40 others of a smaller size distributed over the ports ot Sharjah, Rams, Latt, Lingen and Charak. At the time of the British squadron's visit to Ras -al-Khaimah it was understood that the Qawasim had about 20 vessels actually at sea, ol which 15 were then prowling in the Gulf of 'Oman and 5 in the upper part of the Persian C j ulf The Government of Bombay, though decisive action against the Qawasim was now contemplated, were not in a position to take immediate steps; and, while thev delayed, the temerity of the pirates continued to increase. In October 181/ a Qasimi fleet made a raid on Shaikh Shu'aib, ourned and plundered the villages at the western end of the island, drove off all the cattle, and slaughtered a number of the inhabitants. A little later they entered the roadstead of 'Asalu, captured there 5 large native Baghlahs worth with their cargoes Rs. 3,00,000, and put the crews to death. After a stay of 12 days at Asalu the pirate fleet made a demonstration against Kangun and even attacked Daiyir, but they were repmsed by the inhabitants of the latter place. These outrages, of which the proximity to Bushehr steadily increased, caused a panic in that town; and the people were with difficulty restrained by the Governor from taking flight to the interior. Simultaneously two native ships, with cargoes of cotton, were taken by the Qawasim off Diu; and thereafter the ' Mustapha,' an Arab vessel but officered by Englishmen and flying English colours, was captured only 70 miles north of Bombay. * In these proceedings the local officers appear to have exceeded their instruction. Vide Buckingham, pages 497-498.21 In December 1818 the H.E.I. Company's brigs 'Thetis' and 'Psyche,' Escape of a assisted by H.M.S.

On the 21 si of December 1818, near the island of Qishm, the Company's Defeat of cruiser ' Antelope ' came upon the ' Rahmany,' a full-rigged ship belonging ^ to the Sultan of 'Oman, beset, along with a native Baghlah, by a Qasimi fleet by the consisting of 4 great Baghlahs, 2 Batils of the largest size and another vessel, with 'Antelope,' which they had maintained a running fight for two days, almost exhausting their December ammunition. The ' Antelope,' Lieutenant Tanner, immediately attacked the 1818 - pirate fleet and drove them towards the coast of Qishm; they then turned at bay and made desperate attempts to board their determined assailant, but were repulsed bv the accurate fire of the British guns, after having on one occasion succeeded in approaching within 100 yards. On the pirates taking to flight the ' Antelope ' gave chase and pursued them for 5} hours, but could not overtake them on account of the lightness of the wind. This was a remarkable action, inasmuch as the combined force of the Qawasim amounted to 29 guns and about 1,070 men, whereas the 'Antelope' carried only twelve 18-pounder carronades and two 12-pounder brass guns with a crew, all told, of 71 Europeans and 37 natives. The Qawasim subsequently confessed to the loss of 117 men in the affair with the ' Antelope.' On Christmas morning, 1818, H.M.S. ' Eden ' and the Company's brig-of-war Various ' Psyche ' rescued a captured boat from two pirate Trankis, which managed to engagements, escape; during the whole of the same day the Company's cruiser 'Thetis' ^^ritish tC ' followed without success a Qasimi fleet of 7, and on the next day another of 4 sail; C r U i S ers, and on the 10th and 11th of January 1819 H.M.S.'Eden' sunk 2 piratical Baghlahs October 1818 off Oishm and Hanjam, but failed to capture 6 Trankis by which the Baghlahs to February were accompanied. About the same time H.M.S. ' Conway ' found 17 Qasimi 1819 - war vessels at Bahrain, returning with a large number of men from Qatif, where they had arrived too late to help the Wahhabi Amir in opposing the Egyptian forces which were then overrunning Arabia; but the commander. Captain Barnard, out of respect for the neutrality of the port of Manamah abstained from attacking the Qawasim at anchor; and, once at sea, the Qawasim were able to evade his pursuit. Between October 1818 and January 1819 the Company's cruisers 'Thetis ' and ' Psyche ' encountered the Qawasim sailing in flotillas of 2 to 10 vessels no less than 17 times, and continued to drive them from place to place; but, on account of the superior sailing qualities of the Arab boats, the British vessels seldom or never succeeded in bringing them to action. In February 1819, on the occasion of a British naval demonstration at Bahrain, the Shaikh of those islands was induced to arrange with Hasan-bin-Rahmah for the exchange of some Qasimi prisoners in the hands of the British Government against Indian women then held in captivity at Ras-al-Khaimah: of the latter 17 were released. The Oawasim now entertained the design of forming a settlement at Basidu Preparations on the island of Qishm, to which they might retire if successfully assailed by the by the ever advancing Egyptians, and whence, at the same time, they might continue to Qawasim prey with convenience upon the upward and downward commerce of the Gulf, The gallant action fought by the 'Antelope' is believed to have been largely instrumental in frustrating the execution of this scheme. Conscious of impending retribution, the de facto Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah Overtures of at this point made overtures for a reconciliation with the Government of Bombay the Qawasim and adverted to the negotiations of 1814 between himself, the Wahhabi Amir [h^G^vern- and the British power; but it was too late. His advances were sternly rejected. ment 0 f Bombay. The third British expedition against the Qawasim, 1819-20 The third campaign of the Indian Government against the pirates of the Deliberations Persian Gulf was undertaken, after full consideration, with a firm resolve that preceding the it should be final and conclusive; and it probably would not have been so long cx P ctiltlon - delaved as it was, had it not been for difficulties in India, particularly those occasioned by the Ghurka war of 1814-15 and by the Pindari troubles and Maratha war of 1817-18. Operations appear to have been contemplated as early as 1816; but it was not until September 1818 that the Government of Bombay submitted. 4853322 under orders from the Government of India, detailed suggestions for the pacifica tion of the Gulf. It was believed that a stubborn resistance would be offered by the Oawasim, to overcome which, a strong land force, estimated by the Government of Bombay at 3,000, and by the Government of India at 4,000 or 5,000 men, would be required; and, as on account of the position of affairs in the Dakkhan not a single battalion could be spared in time for service abroad during the approaching winter, the Government of India directed that the expedition should be postponed until the following year. The Wahhabi power in Central Arabia had recently been overthrown by Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad 'Ali Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt; and it was hoped that the eastward progress of the Egyptians, whose active co-operation against Ras-al-Khaimah it was at the same time resolved to invite, would in the meantime make the task of the British easier by striking terror into the Oawasim. Pending a settlement the Government of Bombay maintained the system, which had already been for some time in force, of protecting trade by giving convoy up and down the Gulf to trading vessels,—a duty in which they were materially assisted by His Majesty's ships. Some of the East India Company's vessels were placed for this purpose at the disposal of the officer of the Royal Navy commanding in the Gulf, while others were stationed off the Persian Coast to prevent piratical attacks upon that side. In the following year, 1819, discussion of the measures to be taken in the Gulf was resumed, and various schemes were proposed for ensuring the maintenance of peace after the conclusion of the expedition. The Government of Bombay, who did not regard the possible introduction of the Egyptians into Gulf affairs with much satisfaction, inclined apparently to a scheme under which the Saiyid of 'Oman should be placed in charge for the future of the Pirate Coast and Bahrain Islands, and should in return authorise the formation of a British settlement upon the island of Oishm, and even defray the cost of maintaining it. The Government of Bombay considered that the Saiyad had a hereditary claim to suzerainty over the Pirate Coast, and that the Shaikh of Bahrain had forfeited all claim to consideration by harbouring and protecting pirates; and they understood that the Shah of Persia had expressed his readiness to agree to the occupation of Bahrain by the Saiyid on condition of an annual payment of 30,000 Tumans to himself out of a total estimated revenue of 200,000* Tumans; but they entertained some doubt of the expediency of destroying the independence of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, and they evidently anticipated serious opposition on the part of the Persian Govern ment to the location of a British post on Qishm. The course which was in the end adopted, after argument,t will appear from the sequel: it involved the acceptance of naval and military aid from the Saiyid of 'Oman and the ultimate occupation of Qishm under his authority, but without his financial assistance. * The estimate must have been excessive for the Tiiman was then worth about a pound sterling, while the present revenue of Bahrain is only about £20,000 per annum. t An independent line was adopted by Mr. F. Warden, who had made a special study of Persian Gulf subjects, who in his capacity of Chief Secretary had not been consulted by the Governor of Bombay in regard to the expedition, and who therefore, as a provincial member of the Bombay Board, delivered himself on the 12th August 1819 of a monumental minute on policy. Mr. Warden's main contention was that the Wahhabis, not the Qawasim, were principally to blame for the piracies committed by the latter; and he observed: ' The result of my researches has ' established this important fact, that piracy is not indigenous to the soil or the shores of the Persian ' Gulph, but of recent growth; on the contrary every tribe is rather disposed to engage in ' commercial pursuits.' He argued that the molestation of British vessels was to be attributed to undue interference by the British Government in native affairs in the Gulf; he endeavoured to explain away the ' Bassein ' and 'Viper' cases of 1797; and he represented the Qasamin and 'Utiib as obliged by the Wahhabis to engage in piracy against their will. Of the Qawasim he wrote: 'The Joassmees then, not being free agents but compelled by the Chiefs placed over ' them by the Wahabee to engage in maritime depredations, do not appear to be so atrociously ' guilty, so deeply stained with the crimes of piracy, as 1 thought when I was less acquainted 'with their history.* * * * prevalence of piracy, then, in the Gulph of Persia ' may be attributed wholly and exclusively to the instigation of the Wahabee tribe. Under that 'impression I feel disposed in some degree to advocate the cause even of the Joassmee tribe, and ' to palliate their enormities.' Mr. Warden regarded the Saiyid of 'Oman, on whose weakness and restlessness he dwelt at length, as a most unsuitable chief to be invested with any sort of general supremacy in the Gulf; and it cannot be doubted that he stood on firm ground when he insisted that the Saiyid had no valid claim to the overlordship of the Pirate Coast, that the Persian Government would object to his being placed in possession of Bahrain, and that his claim to sovereign rights over Oishm, as against Persia, was probably ill-founded. Mr. Warden was in favour of reducing the strength of the proposed expedition and of limiting its scope to the restoration of the authority of Shaikh Sultan, the lawful non-Wahhabi head of the Qawasim, for which purpose he would have invoked the co-operation not only of the Saiyid of 'Oman, but also of the Shihuh, the Bani Yas, the 'Utfib of Bahrain and Kuwait, the Persians and the Turks. He23 For the purpose of concluding preliminary arrangements,* Captain G. Forster Mission of Sadleir of His Majesty s 47th Regiment had already been despatched from Bombay, Captain on the 14th of April 1819, with letters for Saiyid Sa'id and Ibrahim Pasha. The '?o m e l r ' A P ni instructions of this officer were that he should call at Masqat, and, after making j anua ^ known to the Saiyid the nature of his mission to Ibrahim Pasha and ascertaining 1820. the nature and extent ot the assistance which the ruler of Oman himself would be able and willing to alford, should proceed with the utmost despatch to the camp of the Egyptian commander, whom he was authorised to assure that, as soon after the termination of the monsoon as it might be convenient to undertake operations from India, an adequate British force, naval and military, would be sent to the Persian Gulf for the purpose of co-operating with the Egyptians in the reduction of Ras-al-Khaimah, and that the town would thereafter be delivered over to be garrisoned by Egyptian troops, provided the Pasha should have allotted a competent force to the service ot covering the siege. In the formal letters addressed to Ibrahim Pasha that general was congratulated on his recent brilliant successes, and the scheme of joint Anglo-Egyptian operations was unfolded for his considera tion. Captain Sadleir was further directed to study the situation of the Egyptians in Central Arabia and to fathom, if he could do so without showing too great an interest in the subject, their ulterior designs in the direction of the^Persian Gulf; agreed, however, with the general opinion that a British station should be established on the island of Qishm, but to this end he would have negotiated with the Government of Persia rather than with that of Oman, and he was even in favour of a transfer of the Persian Gulf Residency from Bushehr to Qishm. He urged the desirability of a convention with the tribes for the suppression of piracy, the importance of a right to visit all ports and destroy armed vessels, and the necessity of a prohibition of the export of ship-building timber from India. Some of Mr. Warden's suggestions had results which are traceable in the subsequent proceedings; but his general line of argument did not meet with the approval of Government In a minute, dated 6th September 1819, Sir E. Nepean, the Governor of Bombay, observed: ' The ^ Board is already in possession of my opinion on the rest of the points contained in Mr. Warden's minute, and all that may be necessary for me at present to add is that the impressions formed by a ll the mo st intelligent officers, naval and military, who have for some years past visited the ' Gulph are directly in opposition to those entertained by Mr. Warden; and so far from thinking ^ they (? the tribes) are disposed to quit their present predatory habits and to have recourse to 'commercial pursuits, they consider their present habits so deeply rooted that nothing but the ^ strong hand of power will keep them down. What said the Chief of Rasell-Khyma on Mr. Bruce's ;; remonstrances in consequence of his breach of engagement on the capture of some vessels belonsing 'to our native subjects? 'If we (meaning the Joassmees) were to accede to the proposition of ' respecting vessels navigated by natives of India, we must starve.' ' * As it has been stated information about Captain Sadleir is not now procurable, the present writer takes the opportunity of placing on record some facts which he has been able to collect regarding the forgotten career and personality of a remarkable officer. George Forster Sadleir was born at Cork on the 19th January 1789. His father, James Sadleir who belonged to a Tipperary family, purchased an estate named Shannon Vale and was at one time High Sheriff of the city of Cork. His mother was a Miss Forster, and his second name was derived from her family. He had two brothers, of whom the younger, Richard served in the Royal Navy. Sadleir joined the Army as Ensign on the 4th April 1805; he was promoted Lieutenant in the same year. Captain in 1813, and Major in 1830; and he retired from the service, by the sale of his commission, on the 17th February 1837. He saw military service at Monte Video and Buenos Aires in 1807; from April 1812 to June 1815 he was engaged, with twelve sergeants from his Regiment, in training the Shah's troops in Persia, in acknowledgment of which he was subsequently awarded a Farman and sword of honour from Fateh 'Ali Shah; he took part in the Malwa campaign, Central India, and was employed in a political capacity under Sir J. Malcolm, 1 f 17_ ! 8; in 1 819-20, he carried out the mission in Arabia, described in our text, for the charge of which he was recommended by the Government of India to the Government of Bombay; in 1820-21 he was sent as Envoy to Sind and concluded the 'Treaty of Hyderabad on the Indus' and in 1824-26 he discharged the duties of Major of Brigade with the'Beneal Division of the British army in Burma. He returned to Europe in 1833 or 1834, probably not for the first time since his departure tor the East, for on the 20th March 1826 he had been enrolled as a Freeman of Cork After his retirement he married, probably in 1847 or 1848, a Miss Ridings of Cork, her brother also marrymg his sister; and about 1855 he emigrated to New Zealand. He died in Auckland before 1868. A personal touch is supplied by an officer of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment who ' : i T ? 1 adlier w 1 as . a great ,,n g mst ' but a man of violent temper, and he was the cause of ^ Colonel Elnngton being tried by Court Martial, as he reported the Reaiment to be in a mutinous ^ state on the line of march in Scotland, when he was in command. It was in the year 1834 and u the Bat j ta allowance was given in kind (bread) in Scotland instead of money, and 'the men could not understand this and stuck the loaves on their bayonets.' Whether his name was spelt ' Sadleir ' or ' Sadlier ' must be considered doubtful: possiblv it was written both ways. An extract copied from the Freeman's Roll of Cork ^ives 'Sadlier'- but Sadleir ' is the form found in the records of the War Office and that favoured bv most of his surviving relatives and friends. It is believed that no male representative of the family bearine the name of Sadleir or Sadlier is now alive. y UCdr]n S24 Captain Sadleir's negotiations with the Sultan of 'Oman, May 1819. Captain Sadieir's quest of Ibrahim Pasha and journey across Arabia, June to September 1819. Unsatisfac tory issue of Captain Sadleir's negotiations with Ibrahim Pasha, September to November. Assurances to Persia. but, whatever those designs might be, he was to refrain irom giving the Egyptians, on behalf of the British Government, any guarantee beyond that authorised in regard to Ras-al-Khaimah. As much information as possible regarding the geography and resources of Central Arabia itself was to be collected by Captain Sadleir in his journeyings; and, having accomplished his mission, he was to return to the Presidency headquarters. Before Captain Sadleir's arrival on the spot, the political situation had so changed as to render the main part of his task impossible of fulfilment, but in his efforts to perform it he showed himself possessed of extraordinary energy and perseverance. Incidentally he achieved the unique distinction of being the first European to traverse the Arabian continent from sea to sea, and that at the hottest season of the year. Captain Sadleir remained at Masqat from the 7th to the 18th of May 1819 and was successful in obtaining from Saiyid Said a careful estimate of the political position and military force of the Qawasim, a promise by the Saiyid to co-operate in person with the British expedition at the head of a large force, a precise statement on the part which he was prepared to take in the operations, and a detailed undertaking to assist in the matter of supply and marine transport. In one respect only Saiyid Sa'id was not amenable to persuasion: he would not consent to any sort of association between his own troops and those of the Egyptians; and he manifestly regarded the proposed co-operation of the latter at Ras-al-Khaimah as in the highest degree dangerous to his interests. Saiyid Sa'id also expressed an opinion that Ibrahim Pasha would be unable to reply to the British proposals without a reference to his father, the Viceroy of Egypt, and that Captain Sadleir's mission could not be accomplished before the time fixed for the expedition, unless the hitter were postponed; in both of these respects his anticipations were remarkably confirmed by the event. On his journey from Masqat to Bushehr, Captain Sadleir was much delayed by contrary winds; nor did he reach Qatif, where his attempts to open communication with Ibrahim Pasha began, until the 21st of June. He found the credit of the Egyptians already gone and their short-lived occupation of Eastern Arabia practically at an end, but he still considered it his duty to convey his despatches to their destination. From Hofuf, which he reached on the 11th of July, he accompanied the disorganised and retreating Egyptian forces by Dara'iyah and SKaqrah to Rass in Qasim, where he arrived on the 26th of August, only to learn that the Pasha^had left 48 hours previously for Madinah. From Rass it was impossible for Captain Sadleir, in the actual state of the country, to return to the Persian Gulf; and he therefore pushed on with the Egyptians to Madinah, in the environs of which he arrived on the 6th of September, his horse falling down exhausted just as he reached the last halting place. On the 8th of September Captain Sadleir obtained an interview with Ibrahim Pasha, and on the following day he delivered the letters of the Governor-General of India and the Governor of Bombay, together with a sword, a gift from the former to the Pasha; but the Egyptian commander insisted on referring the proposals of the Indian Government, though no longer capable of being put into effect, to Muhammad 'Ali at Cairo. The Pasha then proceeded on pilgrimage to Makkah, Captain Sadleir meanwhile awaiting the result of the reference at Yanbo', where he suffered severely from fever. When a sufficient time had elapsed for the receipt of a reply from Egypt, Captain Sadleir followed Ibrahim Pasha to Jiddah; but the tone of the Pasha, formerly friendly, had now become uncivil. Eventually, in consequence of a studied insult to the Governor-General of India contrived by the Pasha in connection with his return present. Captain Sadleir broke off communication on the 14th of November. On the 23rd of January 1820, the H.E.I. Company's cruiser ' Prince of Wales ' happening to visit Jiddah, Captain Sadleir was taken on board and so, apparently, returned to Bombay after an absence of nearly a year, during which he had supported with indomitable spirit the most unusual hardships. Of the despatches sent by Captain Sadleir to the Government of India after his departure from Hofuf not one reached its destination; and in the expedition against Ras-al-Khaimah, which meanwhile took place, the expectation of Egyptian assistance was after the first discarded. To prevent a misunderstanding by the Persian Government of the objects of the British expedition, such as might easily arise through the chastisement of the Shaikhs of Lingeh, Mughu, Charak and Chiru, who were believed to be implicated in recent piracies and whom it was intended to punish, Dr. Jukes was despatched in advance with reassuring letters from the Governor of Bombay for25 the Persian Governor-General of Fars and the Persian Governor of Bushehr; and, on the 15th of December 1819, a letter explaining the intentions of the Indian Government was addressed to Mr. H. Willock, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, for the satisfaction of the Persian Court. iz . J^ the inst [ uctions ultimately issued to Major-General Sir Willian Grant Keir, K.M.G., m whom were vested both the supreme political authority and the direction of the military operations, much was left to the discretion of the commander; but it was clearly indicated that the main purpose of the expedition was the exemplary punishment of the Qawasim of Ras-al-Khaimah and the annihilation of their power, by the capture of the town and the destruction of all their piratical craft as well as of every object of naval or military use which might be found there; and similar measures were to be applied to Rams and other ^ty ports subordinate to Ras-al-Khaimah, and to places on the Persian coast of which the piratical character might be established. The principal restrictions imposed by the orders of Government were that the British troops should not, unless in verv exceptional circumstances, be employed at any distance from the places at which there were piratical vessels to be destroyed; and that, on the Persian side, the utmost practicable consideration should be shown for the undisputed nghts of His Persian Majesty. As regards the temporary administration of Ras-al-Khaimah, which the Government as yet intended to transfer to the Egyptians, it was at first ordered that Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, who had recently deserted the Saiyid ol Masqat in an attempt to capture the place, should not on any account be placed in charge of the same; but this prohibition was early rescinded, Sir W. Grant Keir being invested instead with discretionary power to make the town over after capture to Sultan-bin-Saqar, or to any other chief whom the people might elect, provided only that he was unconnected with the Wahhabis and unlikely to become a patron of piracy. The ships of war placed at the disposal of Sir W. Grant Keir were the lollowing, some of which were assembled at Bombay while others were alreadv in the Gulf; H.M.S. 'Liverpool,' 50 guns. Captain Collier; H.M.S. 'Eden' ^^£ uns ' Curlew, 18 guns; and the H.E.I. Company's cruisers i7 e i| n T. 0U £' ^ Ben J ares ' ' Aurora '' ' Nautilus,' 'Ariel' and 'Vestal,' of 15, 16 14, 14, 10, and 10 guns respectively. The transports for the conveyance ot land troops and naval stores numbered 18; and the military portion of the force con^sted of one company of European artillery,* His Majesty's 47th and 65th Regiments, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry the nank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry and of the Marine Battalion, and half a company of Pioneers; in all 3,069 fighting men ot whom 1,645 were Europeans and 1,424 were sepoys.t The divisional staff consisted of Major E. G. Stannus, Assistant Adjutant-General; Captain D Wilson Assistant Quartermaster-General; and Captain G. F. Sadleir of the 47th Regiment' nterpreter . the place of the last, as he was still absent on his mission, was taken by,. Captain T. Perronet Thompson of H.M.'s 17th Light Dragoons. Sir W. Grant Keir, having embarked in the ' Liverpool' the division of transport 8 carrying the European troops sailed from Bombay on the 3rd of Novem ber 1819 and was followed by the remainder at an interval of a few davs; the woe were under the convoy of men-of-war. The Qawasim remained active to the last. At the end of October their vessels were reported to be cruising in large numbers oft the coasts of Makran, Sind and Kathiawar; and the ' Curlew ' while actually on her way to Bombay to join the fteet, had been attacked bv 15 large Qasimi boats which she deleated in a five hours' battle, sinking three and'eapturin® seven. While the fieet made straight for the appointed rendezvous off Oishm the commander of the expedition proceeded in the ' Liverpool ' to confer with Saivid Said at Masqat arriving there on the 13th of November; on the 21st he joined the main body of the expedition at sea; and on the 24th, a gale then blowing all but the rearmost ships were collected at an anchorage under the lee of r n'raV Island.

Military results. On the 25th of November the ' Liverpool,' 1 accompanied by the ' Benares,' arrived off Ras-al-Khaimah and blockaded the harbour, while the transports on the 26th moved round to Qishm town to take in water. The 26th and 27th were devoted by Sir W. Grant Keir and his chief engineer to an examination of the defences of the town; and. as the result showed that the place might be taken with the force already available at Qishm, the ' Benares ' was sent to summon the fleet thence. The ships arrived on the 2nd of December, followed in the afternoon by the four last transports, whose arrival—lest a change of weather should^ take place—it had been decided not to await; and on tne same day Saiyid Said ot Masqat made his appearance with two trigates and 600 men. Upon this occasion the landing was effected about 2 miles south of the town, and a cordon was immediately formed across the peninsula; the jrd of December passed in these preliminary'operations and in disembarking tents, stores and provisions. It was found that the old wall across the isthmus had been taken down since 1809, leaving a bank in its place, and that a fort' haci been constructed in the middle of the isthmus with the materials; a new wall had also been built, nearer to the town than the old. Rifle pits had been dug by the enemy in advance of his position. On the 4th a ridge about 900 yards from the nearest part of the fortifications was seized by the' 5 ' ' skirmishers and pickets of the torce. the enemy beins driven back upon the fort and town; in this engagement Major Molesworth of the 47th, ' a gallant and zealous off^csr, ,, was struck on the head and killed by a shot from one of the enemies' auns, the fire of which he had mounted the ridge to observe. During the following night a battery for four guns was completed at a distance of 300 vards from the southernmost tower of Ras-al-Khaimah, with a mortar battery on'the right of it about 100 yards from the edge of the inner harbour or backwater. On the 6th the town was bombarded, and its defences shaken by the guns of the fleet and of the land batteries, the response of the defenders'was feeble, apparently for want of ammunition, for they frequently fired large stones from their guns and darted out, between the discharges ot the British arttllery, to collect round-shot which had lodged outside the walls. On the night of the 6th, under cover of unusual darkness, the Arabs made a stealthy sortie; and the British mortar battery on the right was actually in their possession for a short time, during which they succeeded in removing a howitzer to a distance of about 100 yards; but they were quickly driven out again at the point of the bayonet, leaving six dead. During the 7th more guns and mortars were brought into position, including two 24-poiinders from the ' Liverpool, and during the 8th the enemy's works were subjected to almost continuous battering. A bombard ment of the town was maintained throughout the night; and before daylight on the 9th the guns re-opened against the fort, the breaches in which were reported practicable at 8 a.m. The storming party, composed of 100 bluejackets and marines, the whole of the 47th Regiment, and the grenadier and flank companies of the other regiments, then advanced to the attack under the command of Colonel Erlington of the 47th; but their advance were unopposed, and the town, which had been evacuated in the night, was occupied as fast as the troops could run through it. Boats were then brought into the creek, and a party were sent over to Maharah on the Mainland and took possession of a round tower there. The operations had involved much fatigue and privation, which were borne with cheerfulness by the troops. The weather, during part of the time, was inclement and unfavourable. On the British side the total loss in the operations was 1 officer and 4 men killed and 3 officers and 49 men wounded. The casualties of the enemy were admitted by the Shaikh himself to amount to 400 killed and wounded, and some reports placed them at so high a figure as 1,000. Very little ordinary property except cattle remained in the town, the length of the siege having afforded the inhabitants' ample opportunity to remove their effects across the harbour to the mainland; but 60 or 70 guns, most of them small and unserviceable, and about 80 vessels of 40 to 250 tons were captured. The only persons found in the place were a score of men and a few old women; of the former some were captives of the Qawasim. * The fort, which was 350 paces from the new town wall, was a quadrangular stone building of much more solid construction than any ever before seen in ths Persian Gulf. (Regimental Records of the 65th Foot.) t Viz., all the light companies of the force (5 in number) under Captain Backhouse of the 47th, followed by pickets under Major Molesworth of the same regiment.27 III. Useful assistance, especially in the matter of disembarkation and embarkation and in the conveyance of guns, materiel, etc., was lent by the crews of the Masqati frigates. The 'Omani land army did not arrive until two days after the capture of the town; and, at the instance of the British General, they were immediately sent home, lest their presence should lead to complications, and because ol the scarcity of supplies. The Saiyid himself remained on the spot until the 7th of January, when he took his leave. On the fall of Ras-al-Khaimah the ' Curlew,' ' Aurora ' and Nautilus ' were sent to blockade Rams, a coast village a few miles to the northward, at which there were some piratical vessels and of which the Shaikh, Husain-bin-'Ali, was devoted to the Wahhabi interest and had at one time acted as agent on behalf of the Wahhabis in the whole Qasimi country. Rams was found abandoned, the inhabitants having retired to Dhayah, a place about 2 miles inland, where there was a village with a strong fort belonging to Husain-bin-'Ali upon a pyramidal hill; and, as the fort was considered by the Arabs to be impregnable, preparations for its capture, in view of the moral effect which its fall might be expected to produce, were immediately undertaken. On the 18th of December a force, consisting of His Majesty's 65th Regiment, of the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Native Infantry Regiment, and of 30 artillerymen with two brass 12-pounders, two 8-inch mortars and four field guns proceeded against Dhayah under the immediate command of Major Warren of the 65th, General Grant Keir, however, accompanying the troops in person. On the 19th the enemy were driven back upon Dhayah, disputing every foot of ground as they retired through the date plantations; an evasive answer was returned by the Shaikh, who had been summoned to surrender; and a couple of mortars commenced playing on the fort. The defences of Dhayah were found to be unexpectedly strong. On the 20th more ground was gained, and the attacking force was increased by the flank companies of H.M.'s 47th Regiment, under Captain Backhouse, and of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry. On the morning of the 21st Dhayah was completely surrounded. Ensign J. Matheson* of the 65th, ' a most gallant, intelligent and zealous officer,' being killed; and in the evening two 24-pounders from the ' Liverpool,' which had been brought up in face of great physical difficultiest by a naval contingent from the ships, were got into position against the fort on the north-east side, and a couple of 12-pounders against the Shaikh's house on the westward. On the 22nd an opportunity was allowed the garrison of sending their women and children to a place of safety; but it was neglected. At 8-30 a.m. the guns opened, and at 10-30 a breach had been made practicable and a column were about to advance to the assault, but were halted on the appearance of a white flag. The besieged now surrendered on condition that their lives should be spared, they giving up their arms and other property; at 1 *30 p.m. the British flag was hoisted on the fort and Shaikh s house, and the prisoners, amounting to 398 fighting men, were marched to Rams to be embarked on the transports. For the safety, and even comfort, of the women and children, who exceeded 400 in number, every consideration was shown; and before the departure of the squadron so many of the male adult prisoners as were certified by Lieutenant Bruce, the Political Resident, to be usually peaceful cultivators were set at liberty and permitted to rejoin their families, with whom they found an asylum at the adjacent village ot Shimil in Sir. The prisoners not released, amounting—exclusive of the Shaikh himself to 177, most of whom were either professional men-at-arms or natives ol places that remained to bs visited by the expedition, were then removed by sea to Ras-al-Khamail. Eleven guns were captured, and the fort and the Shaikh s house were blown up. The total British loss in the operations at Dhayah was 1 officer and 3 men killed and 16 men wounded, one of whom died; among the Indian troops there were apparently no CclS LI cllt 10S At their return to Ras-al-Khaimah, on the 26th of December 1819, the force from Dhayah found that the demolition of the defences there ordered to be destroyed had been completed by the troops left behind, while the construction of a work for the accommodation of a British garrison had also made considerable Co-operation of Saiyid Sa'id.

On the 17th of January 1820, a garrison of 800 sepoys with some artillery being left at Ras-al-Khaimah, the expedition proceeded against the remaining piratical harbours upon the coast. Jazirat-al-Hamra was found deserted; but at Umm-al-Qaiwain, reached on the 18th of January, and at Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail and Dibai, the fortifications and larger vessels v/ere destroyed. The fate of the shipping of Ras-al-Khaimah itself is not clear; Sir W. Grant Keir was evidently averse to its total destruction, and, for a time at least, spared a portion under plea of employing it in the service of the fleet.* On the receipt of the report that ten piratical vessels had taken refuge in Bahrain, which was now clearly shown to be a constant resort of the pirates and the principal market in which they disposed of their plunder, a naval force was detached to obtain their surrender; and, having been handed over, they were duly destroyed. In February some of the war-vessels and transports, carrying the bulk of the force, crossed over to the island of Qais, where they watered; and thence, the expedition being declared at an end, they returned to Bombay. Some boats were taken and destroyed at the Persian ports of Lingeh, Mughu, 'Asalu and Kangun. Prize money with interest, aggregating Rs. 2,66,625, was distributed seven years later under the orders of the East India Company: it was chiefly on account of vessels taken or destroyed. General Treaty of Peace, 1820. Negotiations with the Qawasim. Preliminary agreements. Having followed the course of military events to the end, we may now revert to the political negotiations which commenced upon the fall of Ras-al-Khaimah. During the siege terms had been offered to such of the garrison as might surrender, but none of them had taken advantage of the offer; on the town passing into the possession of the British, however, Qadhib-bin-Ahmad, Shaikh of Jazirat-al- Hamra, came in upon an assurance of safety and was allowed to remain at large. Encouraged by his example, Hasan-bin-Rahmah also gave himself up on a promise of 41 Aman '; this was a condition by no means implying freedom from personal restraint, but, as his confinement along with his suite appeared to excite general distrust, he was again set at liberty, and confidence was re-established. Numbers of Arabs then flocked in for the purpose of buying back the dates and rice which they had abandoned in the town; Sultan-bin-Saqar, Shaikh of Sharjah, soon after appeared to tender his unconditional submission; and he was followed by Muhammad-bin-Hazza', the nine-year old chief of Dibai, sent in by his father's widow, who was in charge of the government of that principality. On the 15th of January 1820 Shaikh Husain-bin-'Ali of Rams and his followers were released, partly in order to facilitate the negotiations, and partly because there was sickness among the prisoners and it seemed not unlikely that a number of them might die in custody. As the first step towards a general settlement, each principal Shaikh of the Pirate Coast was required to sign a preliminary agreement; and not until he had done so, and had fully discharged its obligations, was he allowed to become a party to the General Treaty of Peace, which was the principal result achieved by the expedition. The objects of the preliminary agreements were, generally, the surrender of the vessels, towers and guns of piratical places, under a promise that pearling and fishing craft should be restored, and the release of Indian prisoners; but no two of the agreements were precisely similar, and that signed at a late stage in the proceedings by an envoy of the Shaikhs of Bahrain bore reference chiefly to commercial dealings between Bahrain subjects and the pirates of 'Oman. By Hasan-bin-Rahmah, now described as Shaikh of Khatt and Falaiyah only, it was agreed that Ras-al-Khaimah, with Maharah on the further side of the harbour, should remain in possession of the British Government. In the case of the Shaikh of Sharjah who had shown from the first a lively anxiety to submit, and of the Shaikh of Dibai, who was but little to blame and for whom the ruler of Masqat had interceded, an undertaking was given that the British troops should not enter or lay waste their towns. 'Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain as well as Sharjah were disposed of in the preliminary agreement made with Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar. The dates of execution of these documents, giving a rough clue to the progress of the * That the Bombay Government, some time later, had reason to doubt whether the orders for the total destruction of piratical craft had been carried out as ordered appears from paragraph 6 of their letter No. 37 of the 16th February 1820. In the Regimental Records of the 65th Foot it is stated that 218 vessels in all were taken or destroyed by the expedition.negotiations, were as follow: by the Shaikh of Sharjah, 6th January 1820; by the Shaikh of Khatt and Falaiyah (Hasan-bin-Rahmah); 8th January; by the Shaikh of Dibai, 9th January; by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Uth January; and by the Shaikhs of Bahrain (through an envoy), 5th February. The General Treaty of Peace, subscribed in turn by each of the above chiefs after the obligations imposed on him by his preliminary agreement had been fulfilled, and also by some additional Shaikhs, was signed as below: by Hasan- bin-Rahmah of Khatt and Falaiyah, formerly of Ras-al-Khaimah and by Qadhib- bin-Ahmad of JazTrat-al-Hamra, at Ras-al-Khaimah on the 8th of January 1820; by Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Thabi, at Ras-al-Khaimah on the 11th of January; by Husain-bin-'Ali ol Dhayah, at Ras-al-Khaimah on the 15th of January, the day of his release; by Zaid-bin-Saif, on behalf of his nephew the Shaikh of Dibai, at Sharjah on the 28th of January; by Sultan-bin-Saqar of Sharjah, at that place on the 4th of February; by Saiyid 'Abdul Jalll, envoy on behalf of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, at Sharjah on the 5th of February, and bv the Shaikhs themselves, Sulaiman-bm-Ahmad and 'Abdullah-bin-Ahmad, in Bahrain on the 23rd of February; and, finally, by Rashid-bin-Hamaid of 'Ajman and 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid of Umm-al-Qaiwain, at Falaiyah on the 15th of March. From their separate signature of this treaty it would appear that the Shaikhs of 'Ajman and Umm-al- Qaiwain were now considered to be independent rulers,—a status not conceded to them in the preliminary agreements. This position they have retained to the present day; but it may be observed, in the same connection, that the Shaikhs of Dhayah (or Rams) and Jazirat-al-Hamra, who no longer enjoy any such distinction, were apparently treated in 1820 as on an equality with those who still do. By the first article of the General Treaty of Peace the signatories bound themselves to abstain for ever from all plunder and piracy by sea and land, in the second article plunder and piracy were distinguished from lawful warfare; and plunder and piracy, to whatever nation the persons attacked might belong, were interdicted under pain of death and forfeiture of property. The third article prescribed a flag for use by all Arabs included in the treaty, namely, that known in the British Navy as ' White-pierced-Red '; of this pattern the red centre was understood to perpetuate the blood-red flag of the Qawasim, the emblem even at the present day of most maritime Arabs, while the white border was symbolical of peace. The object of the fourth article was apparently to make it clear that the British Government entertained no political or territorial ambitions in the Persian Gulf and would not interfere in ordinary local disputes. The fifth article, some difficulty in enforcing which was foreseen by Sir W. Grant Keir himself contemplated the introduction of two sets of papers, viz., identification of every vessel by means of measurements signature of the chief, and a ' Port Clearance,' also signed bv the' chief, to certifv the particulars of the actual voyage on which the vessel might be engaged, both of which were to be produced on the demand of a British or ' other ' vessel; the object of these provisions was to introduce law and order at sea and to prevent irresponsible equipages from ranging the Gulf with impunity. Principally to facilitate execution of the provisions relating to ships' papers the sixth article empowered the ' pacificated ' Arabs to maintain an agent at the British Residency in the Gulf and the British Government to accredit an envoy to the Arabs, the representative in either case to be paid or maintained by the party whose interests he represented. The seventh article, introduced chiefly in order to make it clear that failure of one or more signatories to conform to the treaty should not be held to absolve the others from observance of the same, imposed upon the pacificated Arabs the duty of co-operating with the British Government to punish plunder and piracy. The eighth article condemned the barbarous Qasimi custom of putting prisoners to death in cold blood and proclaimed a war of extermination against those who should in future practise it. The ninth article, which was inserted at the instance of General Grant Keir's Interpreter, Captain Thompson, afterwards a distinguished Abolitionist,* prohibited the slave trade among the pacificated Arabs: this article, which, strange to say, was accepted without demur, was described as politically advantageous, inasmuch as the resistance to the British forces had been carried on largely by means of slaves. The tenth article made the pacificated Arabs free of British ports and conferred on them, in somewhat vague terms, guarantee of British protection against aggression by all and sundry. The eleventh a ' Register ' for etc., given under the the General Treaty concluded, 8th January, 1820. Terms of the Treaty. a See footnote in the history of the 'Oman Sultanate, page 463. 48533 F 2 y •30 Dissatisfac tion of the Government of Bombay with the terms arranged. and last article provided for the adherence from time to time of fresh signatories The Government of Bombay, though they highly commended his conduct of the military operations and appreciated the humane motives that inspired his policy, were disappointed at the leniency of General Grant Keir s settlement, and desired, if it were not too late, to introduce some conditions ol greater stringency. In their opinion the more guilty of the Shaikhs should have been removed from their positions of authority, other local chiefs being substituted for them or their possessions transferred to the Saiyid ot Masqat, while those who had actually fallen into the hands of the force should have been detained m custody, the release of Husain-bin-'Ali was particularly regretted. The* treaty ought to have interdicted the fitting out of armed vessels at ports hitherto piratical, to have limited the size of the vessels employed in commerce; to have stipulated for powers of search and confiscation by the British authorities in order to enforce these conditions; to have provided for a restriction of the export of ship-timber from India, and to have forbidden the construction of fortifications in certain circumstances, at the same time empowering the British Government to enter on and destroy any that might be built in disregard of the prohibition. In the view ot the Bombay Government the treaty, as it stood, afforded no guarantee against the renewal of piracy except one of an illusory character depending on the institution of ships papers, and was so drafted that breach of its conditions would not render he culprits liable to any punishment that might not equally have been inflicted in the absence of a treaty. . • j u * + i , To these strictures Sir W. Grant Keir made a spirited but temperate reply. He explained that if, instead of accepting the voluntary submission of the hostile chiefs, he had attempted to enforce extreme measures against them, it would have been necessary for him, in contravention oi his instructions, to have pursued them into the interior; and that, if others had been substituted in their place, the British Government, committed to the support of their own nominees, would have become entangled in local affairs. The minor stipulations which it was desired to insert in the treaty might, he conceived, be enforced at any time when a necessity for them should arise, for they would be in harmony with the general spirit and objects of the treaty, which were perfectly well understood by the Arabs. In his opinion, any condition which obliged the boats of particular ports to put to sea unarmed would make in incumbent on the British Government to protect them from the attacks of their enemies; and the export of ship-timber from India appeared to him to be a question of the internal regulations of that country, to which it was unnecessary to refer in a treaty with the Qawasim. But the principal argument of Sir W. Grant Keir was that, though a treaty might be entered into with tne Qawasim to restore confidence, ' any measure calculated to secure their retorm must have its foundation in power,' and that reliance must be P la ced, not on the binding power of any agreement, but rather on the moral effect of the defeat whicn the tribe had sustained, and on prompt and effective action by the naval and military force which it was the intention of the Honourable Company to maintain for the future in the Gulf. By the treaty death and forfeiture were declared to be the penalty of piratical crimes, and, such being the case, it could not be said that the treaty failed to render punishable the violation of its own terms. In the end, though in certain respects the views of the Bombay Government remained unaltered, the settlement as arranged upon the spot was allowed to stand; and subsequent events proved the policy of Sir William Grant Keir to have been no less judicious than it was liberal. PERIOD FROM THE GENERAL TREATY OF PEACE TO THE FIRST MARITIME TRUCE, 1820-35. Arrangements for the repression of piracy after the expedition, 1820-23. Views of In despatching a force against Ras-al-Khaimah the Government of Bombay the Bombay had not, as already shown, lost sight of the fact that, whatever immediate success Government might attend the expedition, further measures of a more permanent character * In the objections referred to in this sentence we seem to discover the influence of Mr. Warden. (See footnote, page 659.) [P. 22 of these Extracts.]31 I would be required to confirm the results obtained. The project to which they inclined was the establishment of a British naval and military station in a central situation in the Gulf, which would enable them to exercise a more immediate and commanding influence over its waters than could be wielded from either Bushehr or Basrah. They anticipated that the island of Qishm, which with Hanjam they believed to appertain to the ruler of Masqat, would be found to afford every advantage for the execution of this scheme; that a port might be created thereon which, by means of customs dues, could be rendered self-supporting, at least in part; and even that the Political Residency at Bushehr, where a commercial factory had ceased to be required, might without detriment to British interests in Persia be transferred to the new settlement. The project was referred to Sir W. Grant Keir for an expression of his opinion; and in the meanwhile an effort was made, through the British Envoy at Tehran, to obtain the concurrence of the Persian Government, which it was felt would probably be withheld. One battalion of native infantry was the military force which the Government intended to locate permanently in the Gulf; but they were prepared if necessary to exceed this limit, and at one time they even proposed the retention of one company or more of European troops. An argument advanced in favour of the occupation of an island was that a detachment in such a position would be less exposed to attack than on the mainland, and that the proportion of the garrison immobilised for the defence of the station would in consequence be smaller. At the beginning of April 1820, after a personal visit to Qishm Island, Sir W. Recommen- Grant Keir submitted his views. He deprecated the immediate removal of the j! ati ^ ls J? f Residency from Bushehr, as possibly involving the commercial ruin of that place; ^dr ^ and he suggested that, after the establishment of the new station, some time should 1 ' be allowed for trade to settle in its natural channels before any great modification of the existing political arrangements was undertaken. The General regarded the position of the garrison at Ras-al-Khaimah as perfectly secure; but a very serious difficulty existed in regard to the water supply and scurvy and fever were prevalent, and he consequently advised that the troops should be transferred to Qishm, which he concurred with the Government of Bombay in thinking the most suitable place in the neighbourhood for a cantonment. These views having found acceptance, Captain Thompson, who, ' having Evacuation exerted himself most successfully in acquiring the confidence of the inhabitants,' of R as -al- had been placed in political and military charge of Ras-al-Khaimah with the fgthTuP 1st Battalion of the 2nd Native Infantry and 20 artillerymen under his orders, 1820. U&gt; was instructed, after procuring the consent of the Saiyid of Masqat, to remove his force to the island of Qishm, destroying the defences of Ras-al-Khaimah before &gt; evacuating it, and handing the town over at his departure to Shaikh Sultan-bin- Saqar of Sharjah, or to any other suitable chief. Saiyid Sa'id having readily j signified, in writing, his consent to the occupation of Qishm, Captain Thompson proceeded to negotiate with Sultan-bin-Saqar, promising him possession of Ras- al-Khaimah on condition that he should agree to the detailed stipulations of which the omission from the General Treaty of Peace had been regretted by the Bombay Government; but to this condition the Shaikh would by no means agree, and he further insisted that the defences of the place should not be destroyed before its rendition. Captain Thompson, as the Shaikh remained obstinate and he himself was not vested with discretion in the matter, first destroyed nearly every building in Ras-al-Khaimah, these being all in a greater or less degree fortifications, and then evacuated the place on the 18th of July. Two days later the troops disembarked at Qishm town The occupation of Qishm having given rise to difficulties with Persia, and the Temporary climate of the island having proved extremely unhealthy, a scheme of maritime occupation control was, about the end of 1821, adopted by the Government of Bombay on ^iiowe^bv the advice of Mr. Meriton, Superintendent of Marine; this, it was hoped, would a system J render superfluous the retention of a military force in the Gulf. It was decided purely to maintain in all a squadron of six cruisers, of which three, based on the island maritime of Qais, should cruise continually off the Arab forts from Rams to Dibai. On the control, island of Qais, which was selected because the prevailing winds favoured rapid com munication between it and the Pirate Coast, a small depot of stores, with gunboats, should be established under the care of a Master Attendant and the protection of a small sepoy guard. Of the remaining three cruisers, two were to be employed in carrying despatches, in affording convoy, and in other miscellaneous duties between Masqat and Basrah; and the third was to be used in maintaining communication with Bombay. A year later, on the evacuation of Qishm being32 carried into effect, these arrangements were slightly modified, four instead of three vessels being appropriated to active cruising duties, while one only was reserved for general employment between Masqat and Basrah. Masqat was made, at the end of 1822 the point of rendezvous of the H.E.I. Company s vessels in these seas; but in 1823'Mughu on the Persian Coast was substituted, and arrangements were made for establishing a store depot at that place, as also a Native Agent on the part of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Ultimately in September 1823 the Resident was instructed, in case, as appeared to be probable, the Persian authorities should object to a British establishment at Mughu, to make the necessary dispositions at Basidu instead. Instructions to the Resident, November 1822. Lieutenant McLeod's tour on the Pirate Coast. January 1823. Questions relating to the inter pretation of the Treaty, 1823. Relations of the British Government with the Pirate Coast, 1820 35. The immediate supervision of the Pirate Coast having devolved, at the with drawal of the Qishm detachment, on the Residency at Bushehr, Lieutenant J. McLeod,* an able and judicious officer, now appointed to that post vice Captain Bruce removed, was directed to visit the signatories of the General Treaty of Peace for the purpose of conciliating them, and of confirming them in the disposition which they had hitherto shown to adhere to their obligations; he was also to take advantage of the opportunity to explain that the^ evacuation of Qishm betokened no change ot policy on the part ot the British Government, and that a marine force would still be maintained in the Gult and would continue to visit the Pirate Ports; and he was to arrange for the introduction of ships' papers and the use of a particular flag,—two provisions of the treaty which had hitherto been generally neglected. In case of a recurrence of piracy he was empowered to proceed to the destruction of boats; but he was not to resort to operations by land. On the Persian side the Resident was to maintain a close watch upon piratical ports; but, in case of action becoming necessary, he was merely to refer to the Persian Government, who had now undertaken full responsibility for the control of their own coast. Lieutenant McLeod, besides establishing a system of news reports, was to study in detail the whole political system of the Persian Gull. The true understanding of local affairs upon the Arabian side may be said to date from the time when these orders were carried into execution. In January 1823 the Resident, in the ' Ternate' accompanied by the ' Aurora ' and the Antelope,' all under the command of Captain Faithfull, made a voyage along the Pirate Coast and visited Qatar and Bahrain. Besides interviewing all the principal Shaikhs and fulfilling the other instructions which he had received from Government, especially that relating to the institution of ships papers, the Resident discussed with the chiefs a number of points that had arisen in regard to the interpretation of the General Treaty of Peace, of which document even the simplest requirements did not appear to be universally understood; and the free and friendly intercourse thus established inaugurated a new epoch in the history of British dealings with the Pirate Coast. Incidentally, Lieutenant McLeod sought to dissuade Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar of Sharjah from hostilities against the ruler of Masqat, for in his opinion a state of war between these two, of whom the former possessed the greater military strength and had less to lose, while the latter was the more wealthy, was fraught with grave danger to the safety of seas; and he concerted measures with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to compel Suwaidan-bin- Za'al, a dangerous maritime wanderer with a large following, to adopt a more settled mode of life. As a marine survey of this part of the Gulf, recommended by General Sir W. GranW Keir before his departure, was now in progress, the Resident took the opportunity afforded by his cruise to visit the scene of operations. Between Sharjah and Dohah in Qatar the squadron took a still unsurveyed passage. One measure now recommended by the Political Resident was the establish ment of a Native Agency at Sharjah, if necessary by the transfer of a Native Agent who was then maintained at Qatif; and the proposal appears to have been carried into effect soon afterwards. Connected with the Treaty of 1820 were a number of doubtful points, certain of which, raised for the most part by the perverse ingenuity of Sultan-bin-Saqar, the Resident now referred to Government for an authoritative decision. Before the removal of the troops from Qishm, Colonel Kennett being then the political officer at that place, two other questions had been agitated,—whether the British * Lieutenant McLeod died of fever at Bushehr in the following September.33 authorities had the right to enquire into the building of new vessels at the piratical ports and to destroy them on the stocks in event ot the explanation given being unsatisfactory, and whether it was permissible to detain the vessels of signatory states if not possessed oi the papers or flying the flag required by the treaty of 1820. in both cases the decision appears to have been in the negative. The principal points now discussed were the competence of the British authorities to forbid the building or rebuilding of fortifications by chiefs, the scope of the article (No. 9) relating to the slave trade, and the extent to which under another article (No. 10) the British Government was pledged to protect the pacificated Arabs against the attacks ol non-signatory powers. It was ruled with reference to these, in March 1823, that the terms of the treaty did not warrant any prohibition of the building of forts, that the article in which slaves were mentioned referred not to the buying and selling of persons already enslaved but to raids on the coast of Africa for the purpose of making slaves, which alone could be correctly described as plunder and piracy ; and that the promise of protection against non-signatories only covered the Indian ports to which, by the same article, access was guaranteed to signatories. Here it may be mentioned that Sultan-bin-Saqar, having apparently received Destruction permission from Lieutenant-General Smith so long before as 1821, proceeded in of a tower 1823 to erect a tower 30 feet high on the sea-face of Ras-al-Khaimah, whereupon f S harjah ' Captain Faithfull of the Bombay Marine, supposing this to be a breach of the treaty, at once proceeded to the spot with five cruisers and obtained the demolition of the work. Captain Faithfull's action was rendered possible by his omission to consult the Resident, who was probably by this time aware of the ruling of Government in regard to new fortifications,—an omission which he was enjoined to avoid for the future in all political questions, unless of extreme urgency. The establishment of order at sea was necessarily a gradual process; but piracy Minor had ceased to be a profession, and such cases as occurred, even when they could P ira cies, not be attributed to quarrels among the Arab chieftains or their subjects, did not 1823 - 88 - often affect the vessels of foreigners. At the end ol 1823 one Hassun of Sharjah fitted out a boat for piratical purposes 1823. and was said to have cruised for some time, but without success, off the coast near Jashk; on his return to port his proceedings became the subject of inquiry, but evidence sufficient to ensure his conviction was not obtained. At the beginning of 1824 two other Sharjah boats put to sea with nefarious 1824. intentions, as was reported to the Senior Marine Officer bv the Shaikh, though not until after their departure; and a little later it was stated that they had captured a Mahra Baghlah near Soqotrah, putting all on board of her to death, and had proceeded on their wav to Zanzibar. This case also was apparently not free from doubt, for the British Government, on the return of the boats to their home waters, rested content with the breaking up of one, which was found abandoned at Charak' while the other, discovered at Matrah, was left unmolested. In 1825 a somewhat grave case occurred through an unprovoked attack by 1825. some vessels of Sharjah upon a Bahrain boat near the island of Hanjam, in which the Bahrainis had three or four men killed and were robbed of a considerable amount of specie, and in the month ol August the Senior Marine Officer was directed to proceed to Sharjah with a squadron and demand full compensation.' should it not be granted he was to remove the Residency Native Agent and to capture all the vessels belonging to the port. As a result of his proceedings ample redress was vouchsafed to the injured parties, the Shaikh of Bahrain expressed himself satisfied, and a proper appreciation of the treaty of 1820 was inculcated upon the people of the whole Gulf. In 1826 a series of piracies were committed by 'Obaid-bin-Sa'adui and Saif- 1826-27. bin-Dhaikhan (or Tikhan), adherents of the freebooter Suwaidan-bin-Za'al who had fled from Abu Dhabi territory and settled at Dohah in Qatar, in the nominal jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain. Their offences included the taking of an Abu Dhabi Baghlah, several persons in which were killed and wounded; the capture of an Umm-al-Qaiwain boat, not long retained, with a loss to the defenders of one man killed and one wounded; and the plunder of a vessel belonging to Bahrain. On the ground that the base of these piratical operations was Dohah in the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain, while the sufferers in one case belonged to Umm-al-Qaiwain, a dependency of Sharjah, Sultan-bin-Saqar now attempted to evade payment of the compensation arranged in the Hanjam case of 1825; but his plea was not admitted by the British authorities. It does not appear that in the cases of 1826, though the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi appealed34 1828. Serious piracy on a Sohar boat, 1828. Case of the ' Sunbury,' 1829. Further petty piracies. 1831-34. 1832. 1832-33. to the British authorities and nearly declared war against the Shaikh of Bahrain, any action was taken by the Resident; but in 1827 the Shaikh ot Sharjah was induced to imprison one Adwi of Ajman who had committed piratical acts against boats belonging to Dibai. . . , . , , In 1828 some Bani Yas pirates, who in July of that year had captured two Bahrain Baqarahs and a Kuwait Batil not far trom Dohah, succeeded in escaping to the interior; but the boats taken were recovered and restored to the owners. In September 1828 a vessel manned chiefly by subjects of Abu Dhabi, a cruise upon the Persian Coast of their captain at one place where they toucned, returned to the Arabian side, plundering on their homeward way four boats belonging to 'Asalu which they found in the neighbourhood of Yas Island; but the Shaikh ol Abu Dhabi, on both parties appearing before him, caused the sufferers to be fully compensated. In 1828 the atrocities of earlier days were recalled to mind by an attack made upon a boat from Sohar by a Batil under the command of one Muslim-bin-Rashid of Ras-al-Khaimah; in this affair the whole cargo of the Sohar boat was plundered, the crew numbering 14 persons were tied to a grapnel and thrown overboard, and the vessel itself was scuttled and sunk. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saoar, alarmed at the view of the case taken by the British authorities, despatched a Baghlah in pursuit of the pirate Batil, which was eventually torced on shore near Lingv.h, the majority of the buccaneers were captured and taken to Ras-al-Khaimah, where they were imprisoned for several months; and the Batil and the stolen property recovered were delivered up to the Saiyid of 'Oman. Muslin-bin-Rashid seems to have been subsequently strangled by order of Sultan-bin-Saqar, whom, it rumour may be trusted, he accused of being himself the instigator oi the crime. In 1929 the British merchant ship ' Sunbury ' was somewhat unceremoniously- handled at Sharjah in consequence of a belief, not unfounded, that she carried supplies for the hostile port of Abu Dhabi. The cargo for Abu Dhabi having been resold by the agent of the owner to the Shaikh of Sharjah without the knowledge of the captain of the ship, several boatluls of men boarded the Sunbury in a verv insolent manner to take delivery; an attempt was made to haul down the British flag; and the mate, in resisting it, was struck with some violence by one of the Arabs. The incident was quickly terminated on the arrival of the ' Amherst ' sloop-of-war. Shaikh Sultan, after protesting his ignorance of the affair, caused the first boat that had boarded the ' Sunbury ' to be burnt, while the chief aggressor in the matter of the colours was tied up and flogged by his orders. , , i u • In 1831 a number of places on the Persian Gulf having been deserted by their inhabitants in consequence of the plague then raging, some Qawasim on their way home from Basrah seized the opportunity to plunder Dllam and Rig, which were among the number; and further down the coast they took possession of a boat returning from Kangun to Bushehr. r These excesses appear to have been ignored; but when the Shaikh of Ajman, being openly at war with the people of Sohar as a natural consequence of his coalition with Saiyid Sa'id against them in 1831, extended his depredations to the shipping and commerce of the 'Oman Sultanate to which Sohar had now ceased to belong, steps were immediately taken to call him to account: this, however, was not done until his captures at sea amounted to more than a dozen vessels with their cargoes. Sultan-bin-Saqar having found it convenient to deny that he any longer possessed authority over Ajman or Umm-al-Qaiwain, an ultimatum was conveyed direct to Shaikh Rashid of 'Ajman by two British vessels of war; and his efforts at evasion being cut short by a refusal to allow him more than 24 hours' grace, the Shaikh, after the value of one 'Ajman Batil seized in reprisal by the people of Masqat had been deducted, made good the balance of the claim by handing over boats, money, jewels and other property to the required amount. These events took place in 1832. In May 1832 a boat belonging to a British subject was taken by pirates oil the Persian Coast; and subsequently three of the principal offenders, who belonged to the village of Khan in the Sharjah pricipality, absconded from that place and took refuge with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The settlement of this case was delayed by other more pressing demands on the services of the British cruisers in the Persian Gulf; but in 1833 the chief of Abu Dhabi, on whom the first demand was served, paid up a fine of $1,500 rather than surrender the criminals. Shaikh Sultan, from whom $2,000 fell to be recovered, was at first recalcitrant; but a few shots fired into a Sharjah Batil lying near 'Ajman quickly brought him to his senses.35 In 1833 the crew of a Qasimi boat touching at the Island of Khargu carried 1833. away a portion of a tent belonging to the British Residency, which had been transferred to Khargu during the prevalence of plague at Bushehr; and, as the marauders were well aware of the British ownership of the article stolen, the case was treated as one of intentional insult, and a war vessel was sent in pursuit. The thieves were found at Muhammareh and brought back with the stolen property to Bushehr, but were afterwards released at The intercession of the Shaikh of Bushehr. In 1834 some members of the Sudan tribe who had recently removed from 1834. 'Ajman to Abu Dhabi attacked a Batil of the Matarish from Matrah and plundered her of property worth $1,000; no loss of life, however, occurred. In this case redress was withheld by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, until British vessels, prepared to enforce it, appeared off his port. In this year the squadron in the Gulf consisted of two cruisers only, the ' Amherst ' and the ' Elphinstone.' The year 1835 was made remarkable by an expiring flicker of the old piratical Final out- spirit, which this time flamed up, not among the subjects of the Qasimi Shaikh, break of but in the formerly well-behaved and law-abiding tribe of the Bani Yas. The P irac y outbreak may be attributed partly to a change of rulers at Abu Dhabi and to dissensions among the Bani Yas; partly to the passions kindled by recent savage 1335. wars between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah; and partly to the weakness of the British naval establishment in the Gulf. The Bani Yas pirates placed themselves in the fair-way of the Gulf and began to prey upon passing commerce without respecting any flag, even the British; their robberies were accompanied by atrocities, such as the massacre of entire crews, that vied with the worst offences in former days of the Qawasim; and so infatuated were they by their easy success against native trading vessels that one of their squadrons put to sea with the avowed object of encountering the Company's cruisers. On receiving news of this last challenge Commodore Elwon, commanding the Persian Gulf squadron of the Indian Navy, immediately directed Captain Sawyer to proceed with his vessel, the ' Elphinstone ' sloop-of-war, in search of the pirates and to bring them to action. The ' Elphinstone ' carrying eighteen 32-pounders, was much more powerful in relation to the Arab war-vessels than her predecessors of 15 years before,—a fact which the pirates perhaps did not appreciate; but her crew was comparatively small, numbering only about 150 men, of whom however 80 were Europeans. On the 16th of April the ' Elphinstone ' came up with the pirate fleet, which appeared to consist of 3 Baghlahs, 1 Batil and 3 Baqarahs, the largest Baghlahs having one of the others in tow: this last vessel proved eventually to be the ' Nasir ' of Kangun, captured by the pirates off Kung four or five days previously. After gaining a position to windward and double and treble shotting his guns with round and grape, Captain Sawyer, unfettered by the necessity of waiting till he was attacked, steered between the large Baghlah and her prize; and, as the ' Elphinstone ' passed through with her guns almost touching the enemy's sides, both broadsides were discharged with terrific effect, making the splinters fly in every direction. The Arabs confined themselves to an attempt to board, which had it been successful would have sealed the doom of the ' Elphinstone,' for the large Baghlah alone contained at least 200 men; but it was frustrated by a destructive fire of small arms. Seeing that the fortune of the day was against them, the pirates at once made off, abandoning the ' Nasir,' from which a prize crew of about 90 men leaped into the water and were picked up by the large Baghlah. That vessel, accompanied by the Batll, was pursued by the 'Elphinstone' until nightfall, when she rounded Farur Island and disappeared; and meanwhile the remainder of the pirate fleet, after stripping the ' Nasir ' as far as they could, sailed away in another direction. Returning on the next day to the scene of the encounter, the British cruiser took possession of the ' Nasir ' and rescued nine of her original crew drifting on a raft, to which, fearing the return of the pirates, they had committed themselves. Enquiry showed that 33 dead bodies of pirates had been thrown overboard from the ' Nasir ' alone while some 25 wounded had been carried off by their friends; and the losses on the large pirate Baghlah must have been even more considerable. The settlement with the Bani Yas which followed this well-merited chastise- Piracies by ment was satisfactory in the extreme. One brig, 7 Baghlahs, 2 Batils and 5 Baqarahs, which had been captured by the Bani Yas, were surrendered; the ^ greater part of the cargo taken from the ' Durya Wowlut,' a Baghlah under British colours, was recovered; compensation for other property to the amount of over $10,000 in cash and kind was obtained, a bond and security in the shape 48533 G36 Piracies by Dibai boats, 1834-35. Piracies by Sharjah boats, 1835. of 3 large Bani Yas vessels being taken for due payment of the balance of $1,600; all prisoners in the hands of the pirates were released; and two of the principal buccaneers, Muhammad-bin-Saqar and Muhammad-bin-Majid, were handed over to be tried for their crimes. In addition a Bani Yas Batil, which happened to arrive from India at Masqat, was detained by the authorities of that port. At Bombay Muhammad-bin-Saqar was convicted of piracy on the high seas in the case of the ' Durva Dowlut ' and sentenced to transportation for life; but Muhammad-bin-Majid, on the failure of the case against him, was brought back to the Gulf to be handed over to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, and unfortunately escaped by swimming ashore from an anchorage lour miles off Sharjah. _ General depredations on the trade of the Gulf were commenced by the A1 Bii Falasah of Dibai soon after their secession, elsewhere described, from Abu Dhabi; they attacked and plundered 1 Masqat, 1 Bahrain and 2 Naband vessels, murdering in the first case 5 men; and they looted a village on the coast of Batinah near Masqat. A British demonstration against the town of Dibai, however, procured full satisfaction in the cases in which it had not been voluntarily afforded or otherwise obtained. In 1835 the Sharjah chief, on pretence of assisting the Saiyid of 'Oman against the rebellious town of Sohar, proceeded with a fleet to Khor Fakkan and Dibah, but his depredations soon extended beyond the shipping of Sohar to that of his nominal ally, and even to neutral vessels; for such as were reported, however, he was compelled to afford satisfaction. Relations of the Pirate Coast Shaikhs with the Saiyid of Masqat, 1820-35. Before proceeding to review the internal history of the Pirate Coast from the General Treaty of Peace in 1820 to the first Maritime Truce in 1835, we may take account of some external influences which were not without their effect upon domestic policies. The foreign factor or greatest importance on the Pirate Coast, after the British power, was at this time undoubedly the Saiyid of Masqat. The principal supporters of His Highness on the Pirate Coast were ordinarily the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai; but in 1823 an exceptional combination occurred, Abu Dhabi and Dibai allying themselves with Sharjah, while 'Ajman sought to preserve his independence of Sharjah by attaching himself to Masqat. The Baraimi- In 1824 a dispute arose between Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat and Shaikh Sultan- Dairah case, bin-Saqar of Sharjah over the oasis of Baraimi, which, in a former treaty between 1824-27. them, had been declared neutral territory; the details of the quarrel are now obscure, but it seems that the Shaikh of Sharjah had wrongfully built or taken possession of some towers in Baraimi. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had in the meantime encouraged a colony of Sudan refugees from Sharjah to build a fort at Dairah between Dibai and Sharjah; this settlement was a source of much annoyance to the Sharjah Shaikh, and, in conjunction with the Baraimi difficulty, produced a general state of tension which the British Resident considered it his duty to relieve. At a visit to Sharjah in December 1824 the Resident effected a reconciliation of the parties on an understanding that the Baraimi towers and the Dairah fort should both be demolished, and that the Stidan immigrants should be removed to some other part of the Abu Dhabi principality. In February 1825, no steps having been taken by Sultan-bin-Saqar to carry out his part of the arrangement, a strong remonstrance was addressed him by the Resident; the Shaikh in reply pleaded intrigues on the part of his adversaries and suggested that a commission of three persons, one appointed by himself, one by the Saiyid of Masqat and one by the Resident, should be sent to Bairami to superintend the execution of the agreement. In May 1825 the Resident took advantage of a visit which he paid to Masqat to despatch Gulab Anandas, the Native Agent representing Britain at that port, along with some troops of the Saiyid to witness the destruction of the Baraimi towers under an authorisation specially obtained from the Sharjah Shaikh. Scarcely however had the delegate started when Sultan-bin-Saqar made a sudden attack on Dairah, afterward repulsing a force sent by Tahnun-bin-Shakhbut to its relief; and this treacherous action on his part necessarily put an end to the efforts of the Resident to adjust the quarrel. The Masqat Agent, it may be noted, on his return from Baraimi, reported about the delay in the proceedings in a sense wholly unfavourable to the good faith of Sultan-bin-Saqar.37 The result of the rupture between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi was to prevent the subjects of either Shaikh from taking part in the pearl fishery for the year, an exclusion which was severely felt by both sides and led to a reconciliation in October 1825 under the auspices of Sayid Sa'id of Masqat, then present on the coast with a squadron of his vessels. In this settlement the Baraimi difficulty was entirely ignored; but the demolition of the Dairah fort and the withdrawal of the Sudan colony by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi were decreed. A curious clause, probably representing the Saiyid's brokerage on the bargain, was added, but apparently remained unfulfilled; it provided for the neutralisation of the town of Dibai by the handing over of its defences to the ruler of Masqat. The arrangement remained a dead-letter until 1827, when the dismantlement of Dairah was enforced by Saiyid Sa'id with a naval force; but His Highness before his departure compensated Shaikh Tahnun with a gift of military stores and encouraged him to seize Dubai. The ruler of Masqat undoubtedly considered a rapprochement between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi to be hostile to his own interests. In 1829, before starting on his first expedition to East Africa, Saiyid Sa'id endeavoured to arrange for the security of his possessions at home by granting subsidies to some of the Pirate Coast chiefs, and among them Shaikh Sultan-bin- Saqar was promised an allowance of Rs. 2,000 a year. Notwithstanding this payment the faithless ruler of Sharjah was hardly restrained, at first by the remonstrances of the chief men of his tribe and later by the menaces of the British Government, from throwing in his lot with the rebels who in 1830 attempted to upset the Saiyid's government. After Sa'id's return from Africa he endeavoured to obtain the aid of Sultan- bin-Saqar in his operations for the recovery of Sohar in 1831, but the Shaikh hung back, demanding as the price of his support the transfer to himself of either Dibah or Khor Fakkan, and eventually a raid by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on Qasimi territory prevented his taking part on either side in the fighting at Sohar. The movement 'of the Abu Dhabi Shaikh was intended to embarrass Saiyid Sa'id, who had declined his assistance at Sohar, probably because of the bad behaviour of the Bani Yas contingent in an expedition against Bahrain in 1828. The only one of the Pirate Coast chiefs who rallied to the side of Saiyid Sa'id before Sohar was consequently Rashid-bin-Hamaid, Shaikh of 'Ajman, a dependent of Shajah: on the defeat of the Masqat troops this unreliable ally changed sides and helped to complete the Saiyid's discomfiture. In 1832, on the occurrence of another rising against Saiyid Sa'id's authority during his second absence in East Africa, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar availed himself of the opportunity to seize, by surprise or treachery, Dibah and the Shamailiyah ports of Khor Fakkan and Ghallah, which were thus lost to the 'Oman Sultanate. But for the timely arrival of two Masqat frigates, with reinforcements and stores, it is probably that the town of Shinas also would have probably have fallen into his hands. Connection of the Wahhabi power with Pirate Coast affairs, 1820-35. The prestige of the Wahhabi Amir was for a time destroyed by the successful operations of the Egyptian and British forces against him and his dependents; but, with the withdrawal of the Egyptians from Najd and of the British from Qishm, his influence in 'Oman began to revive. Though in 1821 Sultan-bin-Saqar had already abjured Wahhabi tenets, and though his authority was even then preponderant over that of Husain-bin-'Ali of Rams, the official representative of the Wahhabi interest on the Pirate Coast, it was nevertheless the case that in 1823 a large proportion of the people were still Wahhabi in sympathy; but of the secular power of the Wahhabi Amir there was no longer a trace to be found in the country. In 1824 the Wahhabi state began to raise its head once more in Central Arabia; and Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar and his chief dependent, Shaikh Rashid- bin-Hamaid of 'Ajman, lost no time in creating interest for themselves with its ruler. The negotiations were conducted quite openly on the part of the Shaikh of Sharjah, who pretended that they were necessary for his safety. In November 1825, in an interview with the British Resident, Shaikh Sultan- bin-Saqar professed great fear of the growing power of the Wahhabis and enquired whether he might rely on British aid in endeavouring to defend his independence against them; he also asked what course he should follow if the Wahhabis were to make war on the Saiyid of Masqat and demand the assistance of Sharjah.

Ineffectual Wahhabi intervention. 1834. reply was apparently given to the question about British suppoit, the Bombay Government thinking it more prudent not to publish their intention of avoiding a collision with Wahhabis over merely territorial matters; but the Shaikh was informed that no plea of compulsion by the Wahhabis would be admitted b\ the British Government in extenuation of piratical proceedings, and he was strongly advised to abstain from joining any combination against His Highness of Masqat. In 1830 the successes of^the Wahhabis in Hasa and the prospect of their immediate appearance in 'Oman caused a considerable stir upon the Pirate Coast. The Shaikh of Sharjah. who had everything to lose by their return, endeavoured, while openly professing delight at their approach, to obtain in secret a promise of support against them from the British Government; but it was explained to him that Britain had no end in view except the maintenance of maritime security and could not interfere in the internal affairs of Arabian states. A large number of the common people, however, as well as the Shaikhs oi Ajman and L mm-al- Qaiwain, who hoped that by some change they might be freed from^ their dependence on Sharjah. sincerely rejoiced at the appearance ol the Wahhabis; and Rashid-bin-Hamaid of 'Ajman even applied for the post of Wahhabi vicegerent in the country, but received the chilling reply that the Amir regarded, and would continue to regard, the Saiyid of Masqat and the Shaikh of Sharjah as the two heads of the tribes of 'Oman. Rashid was however made the medium, in 1831, of a communication from the Wahhabi Amir to the Governor of Bombay, in which the former signified a wish to be on terms of amity with the British Government. In 1833, in consequence of an internal revolution, the principality of Abu Dhabi fell temporarily under Wahhabi influence; and in 1834 the Wahhabi representative at Baraimi interposed, on the side of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, in the chronic feud—then at its height—between that ruler and the Shaikh of Sharjah. His action, however, though it prevented Sultan-bin-Saqar from obtaining Bedouins to beleaguer Abu Dhabi Town on the landward side, did not seriously impress him or cause him to desist from hostilities. Relations of the Qawasim with the Persian Coast, 1920-35. The Qawasim had still a close connection with the coast of Persia, where Lingeh was governed by a family of their tribe; and they seem to have favoured, not unnaturally, the side of the local Arab Shaikhs in the periodical difficulties between the laiter and the central Persian Government. Demonstra- i n \^2 Shaikh Nasir, a heriditary Governor of Biishehr who had been ^ n at expelled by the Persian authorities, blockaded his former charge and summoned 1 gp e r ' the Qawasim to his aid, promising them the plunder of the town if it should be taken. In response to this invitation Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, at the end of November, arrived in person at Bushehr with a fleet carrying from 1,000 to 1,500 men; and serious mischief might have resulted had not Mr. Blane, the British Resident, seeing that Shaikh Nasir's blockade had already failed and that there was no hope of his permanent restoration by violence, ordered the Qawasim to withdraw. This they did reluctantly and only in consequence of threats by the Resident to employ force. Internal affairs of the Pirate Coast, 1820-35. Position in Even before the evacuation of Ras-al-Khaimah by the British forces. Shaikh 1821 - Sultan-bin-Saqar had stepped into the place of principal authority among the Qawasim. Hasan-bin-Rahmah of Ras-al-Khaimah had then already become subservient to him; and the aged Husain-bin-'Ali of Rams, who clung to his Wahhabi ideas and was apparently supported by Qadhib-bin-Ahmad of Jazirat- al-Hamra, could make no head against his influence. Position in At the time when, in January 1823, Lieutenant McLeod's visit to the Pirate 1823. Coast first laid bare to view the internal politics of the country, the influence and power of the Shaikh of Sharjah greatly exceeded those of any other chief, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, his chief competitor, not excepted. Sultan-bin-Saqar had now deported the old Shaikh of Rams to Sharjah, replacing him by Muhammad-bin- 'Abdur Rahman, the son of a former Shaikh; his own brother Muhammad he had placed over Ras-al-Khaimah town, which now occupied a site on the mainland39 opposite to the peninsula; the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid, owned him for his liege-lord; and on the coast northwards of Sharjah the only chief who considered himself independent was Rashid-bin-Hamaid, the Shaikh of 'Ajman. This last obstacle in the way of his complete supremacy Sultan-bin- Saqar was extremely anxious to remove, and, as evidence of his rights over 'Ajman, he referred the Resident to the preliminary agreement made between himeslf and General Sir W. Grant Keir in 1820, which expressly covered 'Ajman; but the force of the argument as proving the permanent subordination of 'Ajman was not admitted, and the Shaikh was further informed that the British Government took no interest in his claims to suzerainty over other chiefs. Lieutenant McLeod, dissenting from the current view that the ruling Shaikh of Sharjah was little better than a monster in human shape, described him at this time as a turbulent and ambitious man, but superior in ability, as well as in most other respects, to his neighbours. The establishment of Shaikh Sultan's power over the whole Pirate Coast might, he reported, possibly be advantageous to Govern ment; but it should be understood that, as no Shaikh was absolute even in his own tribe, so the hegemony of Sharjah over the other principalities would be nominal at the best; and the Resident foresaw trouble from the rancorous hatred of its ruler for Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat. The principality of Dibai, still governed by Zaid-bin-Saif, the uncle of the Shaikh, was at this time dependent on that of Abu Dhabi, of which the ruler was Tahnun-bin-Shakhbut; and both of these states, which were military and pastoral rather than maritime in their condition, generally inclined to alliance with Masqat. The Qawasim, whose extreme poverty and fewness of resources were now for the first time set in a clear light, still built their boats entirely of Indian teak; their warlike stores were obtained from Bahrain, from the Persian ports of the lower Gulf, and from Masqat; and their arms, mostly taken from prizes, were commonly of Persian manufacture. None of the chiefs possessed more than three or four boats except Sultan-bin-Saqar who had at least 30 fine vessels, each capable of containing 50 to 100 men; and it was strongly suspected that most of these were over three years old and had been hidden away by the Shaikh, instead of being surrendered, at the time of the British expedition. Qadhib-bin-Ahmad of Jazirat-al-Hamra was now dead; in 1824 his successor was removed by Sultan-bin-Saqar to make way for a more pliant representative in the person of one Ahmad-bin-'Abdullah; and about the same time the Shaikh of 'Ajman also bowed to the inevitable and acknowledged the overlordship of Sharjah, In 1825 Shaikh Sultan, having acquired influence at Dibai by his own marriage with the sister of the young Shaikh, was scheming to obtain actual possession of that place, the nearness of which to his capital would be a serious danger in case of its falling under inimical influences. In 1832 however, Sultan- bin-Saqar, made aware by experience of the disadvantages of being held responsible for the behaviour of minor chiefs, formally resigned his pretensions to suzerainty over 'Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain; and in 1833 he sustained a serious reverse at Abu Dhabi which cannot but have lowered his prestige. Meanwhile, in 1828, the town of Ras-al-Khaimah had begun to rise once more on its original site, the ruins of the old town serving as quarries of material for the new; the wall across the isthmus on the landward side of the town had already been restored; and a square tower had been built on a mound which marked the place of a former principal fortification. It is unnecessary here to do more than refer to the acts of war between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi which took place in 1825 in connection with the Baraimi-Dairah quarrel, and which have already been mentioned above. In February 1829 Sultan-bin-Saqar, irritated by a constant coalition against himself between the Saiyid of Masqat and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, took advantage of the failure of the joint expedition of those two powers against Bahrain to declare war against Abu Dhabi; and very soon, by means of a blockade, he succeeded in reducing to severe straits the principal and only town belonging to his rival. The prospect of exclusion from the approaching pearl fishery was however equally disagreeable to both sides; and in June 1829, by the mediation of Muhammad-bin- Qadhib, Shaikh of Lingeh, peace was arranged on condition that neither party should interfere any more with the subjects or dependents of the other. In 1831 trouble was renewed in consequence of the curious imbroglio, already described, which resulted in 1831 from the operations of Saiyid Sa'id of Masqat against Sohar. The Shaikh of 'Ajman, on his return from Sohar, found that his town had been plundered and the flocks of his subjects raided by Bani Yas and Continued ascendancy of the Shaikh of Sharjah, 1823-32. Hostilities between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, 1825-31.40 Manasir despatched by Shaikh Tahnun-bin-Shakhbut; and war against Abu Dhabi was immediately declared on his part and on that of the Shaikh of Sharjah. A peace was shortly patched up by the Shaikh of Lingeh, no doubt with the object of postponing matters until the end of the pearl season; but in September it was broken by subjects of Sharjah, who attacked two pearl boats of the Bani Yas near Bahrain, an act to which the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi immediately replied by seizing 14 vessels of the Qawasim that happened to call at his port tor^provisions. A partial adjustment of claims now took place, but in December 18 j 1 the situation was again strained; no further serious operations however took place. Determined In 1833, encouraged by a split among the Bani Yas and the secession of but ineffec- the Ba Fal a Sa h section and others from Abu Dhabi to Dibai, Shaikh Sultan- oTshlrjah bin-Saqar resolved on a supreme attempt to overthrow, once for all, the power of to crush his hated rival the Bani Yas Shaikh. Abu Dhabi, All Sharjah subjects having been hurriedly recalled from the pearl banks 1833-34. j n t h e height of the diving season, much to their discontent, a naval expedition against Abu Dhabi was prepared without delay; it consisted of 22 boats carrying 520 Qawasim, under the command of Shaikhs Sultan-bin-Saqar and Hasan-bin- Rahmah, and of 80 boats manned by 700 of the A1 Bu Falasah and other refugees at Dibai. On the afternoon of the 10th September 1833 the Qawasim and their allies landed at a point about four miles from Abu Dhabi, which town they expected to find almost deserted and to capture without dilficulty on the morrow; but the Shaikhs of the Bani Yas had received sufficient notice of the intended attack to collect a large number of their own tribe and of Manasir Bedouins; and, when the sun rose, the invaders discovered that they were surrounded by a vastly superior force. Seized by panic they fled to their vessels; but most of these, left high and dry by the tide, were not available for escape. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar himself was nearly drowned by the sinking of a small boat, in which he had put to sea along with four of his slaves. The losses of the Qawasim on this occasion amounted to 30 men killed, including a brother of the Shaikh of Lingeh; and six of their vessels, one a Batil, were taken. Of the Bani Yas allies 15 were killed, and 235 were taken prisoners and compelled to return to their homes at Abu Dhabi, while oi the 80 boats contributed by the Bani Yas dissidents no less than 60 were captured. The Shaikh of Sharjah did not, however, abandon his enterprise, but by means of alliances with the Shaikhs of 'Ajman and Lingeh got together a fresh fleet, which sailed from Dibai on the 9th of November 1833. Having arrived before Abu Dhabi, Sultan-bin-Saqar during three days endeavoured to take the place by direct naval attack; but his attempts were defeated by a large mixed garrison of townsmen and Bedouins, whose fire from six or seven large vessels moored by iron chains to the shore was very effective and even damaged the Baghlah ol Shaikh Sultan himself. A blockade was accordingly substituted on the part of the Qawasim, by which the defenders of the town scon found themselves reduced to serious straits; and the departure of Saiyid Sa'id from Masqat to his African possessions destroyed, about the same time, their last hope of assistance trom without. To add to the troubles of the besieged, thirty of their boats were captured by the Qawasim at some distance from Abu Dhabi; ten of their men were killed in an engagement with the people of Dibai; and a caravan of 50 camels bringing dates from Baraimi to Abu Dhabi was intercepted by the enemy. The garrison, however, did not lose heart, but under cover of night sent three large vessels carrying 500 men to sea; these were pursued by a detachment of 20 sail from the blockading fleet, but were not overtaken. The first exploit of the escaped vessels was the capture of an Ajman Baqarah near Bustaneh; out of the crew of eight men, seven were put to death. Then they attacked a Masqat Baghlah, killed five of her crew, and plundered her of a quantity of dates, Rs. 3,000 in 'cash and all her guns,—a piratical proceeding for which they afterwards voluntarily accounted 'to the Masqat authorities without the intervention ol the British Resident. After this, a pursuing Qasimi squadron coming in sight, they made sail for home and regained Abu Dhabi in salety. Meanwhile Shaikh Khalifah-bin-Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi had succeeded in inflicting deterrent punishment on the Ghafalah and other Bedouin tribes who had assisted the people of Dibai in cutting off his supplies by land, and the discomforts endured by the crews of the blockading (leet were hardly less than those which the inhabitant's of the beleaguered town suffered: for the provisions and water of the fleet had to be obtained from Lingeh and Ras-al-Khaimah, and each individual on board was required to make the arrangements for his own supply. Finally, in 1834, a peace was arranged through the Shaikh of Lingeh, the Shaikh of Abu41 V Dhabi restoring all the vessels which he had captured since the beginning of the war and the Shaikh of Sharjah withdrawing his blockade. The peace was not of long duration. A foray in Qasimi territory by Manasir Bedouins, dependent on Abu Dhabi, led to retaliation by the seizure upon the pearl banks of ten Bani Yas boats, together with their crews of 80 men and pearls to the value of Rs. 4,000. This rupture having obliged the Shaikhs to withdraw their subjects from the banks, a penalty severely felt by both, Shaikh Khalifah of Abu Dhabi was persuaded to send his father Shaikh Shakhbiit as an envoy to Sharjah with proposals of peace, and a stable treaty was at length arranged. In regard to Bani Yas domiciled at Dibai it was settled that they should henceforth be regarded as subjects of Sharjah. The exhausting war which we have just described, perhaps the most persistently waged of any that ever occurred between Shaikhs of the Pirate Coast, had undoubtedly an excellent effect in preparing the way for the conclusion of the first Maritime Truce in 1835. PERIOD FROM THE FIRST MARITIME TRUCE TO THE PERPETUAL TREATY OF PEACE, 1835-53. The Maritime Truce and Restrictive Line, 1835-36. The insufficiency of the General Treaty of Peace for the purpose of main taining security at sea was now fully apparent; for it did not prohibit regular maritime warfare, and experience had shown that in the Persian Gulf such warfare must usually be expected to degenerate into indiscriminate piracy. The need of further restrictions seems to have been felt even by the chiefs themselves. The Shaikh of Sharjah, in 1827, and the Shaikh oi Bahrain, in 1828, argued earnestly that under Article No. 4 of the Treaty the British Government were bound to prevent hostilities at sea, whatever their nature^ among the pacificated Arabs; but the reception by the British authorities of this suggestion was necessarily, from the wording of the Treaty, unfavourable. The attempt to enforce the provisions relating to ships' papers, it may here be remarked, had long been abandoned as impracticable; and in other respects, as we have seen, the Treaty had been found ambiguous, if not unworkable. The British Government were as yet unwilling to assume responsibility for the prevention of all warfare at sea, especially as they foresaw that interference might disturb the balance of power between maritime principalities and others ol which the power was chiefly military; and in 1834 the Court of Directors expressly ruled that it was inexpedient, even at the invitation of the petty Arab States, to assume any sort of protectorship or arbitral authority over them. Nevertheless the British authorities, while they continued to regard themselves as in strictness merely the head of a naval confederacy for the suppression of piracy, exerted all their influence on the side of peace, and for a time even made it a rule to treat as piracy all aggressions committed on the pearl banks during the annual fishery; they insisted also that the requirements of the Treaty of Peace should be observed even by such Arab principalities as were not parties to it, such as those ol Qatif and Kuwait. These being the circumstances and the views of the principal parties. Captain S. Hennell, the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, seized the opportunity of the settlement with the Bani Yas to assemble some of the principal Shaikhs or their agents at Basidu, where, after an unavailing attempt had been made to adjust their claims and counter-claims, it was proposed by Captain Hennell that they should agree to a Maritime Truce to cover the season of the approaching pearl fishery. This suggestion having met with general acceptance, a more formal meeting was held at the Bushehr Residency on the 21st August 1835, and here a document was sealed by or on behalf of the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dibai, Ajman and Abu Dhabi, whereby they bound themselves to observe an inviolable truce from the 21st of May to the 21st of November of the same year, during which period all claims should remain in abeyance; to afford redress for any refraction of the truce by their respective subjects; and, in case of any aggression being committed upon their subjects, not to retaliate, but to report the matter to the British political or naval authorities. The Resident on his part was careful to explain to the parties, Failure of the Treaty of 1820 to establish absolute security. The first Maritime Truce. 1835.42 \ before execution of the agreement, that any breach of the truce, when once established, would be treated as a case of piracy, and no regard would be paid to the existence of a state of war on land. The Shaikh of Bahrain, who was amenable to British influence and between whom and the Saiyid of Oman there was at the time a prospect of war, was not invited to subscribe to the Truce; but everywhere its conclusion was hailed with delight by those interested in the pearl trade,—in some cases almost the entire population. The importance of Captain Hennell's achievement may be judged by the fact that, before this, some of the pearl merchants of Sharjah had actually offered to pay $20 a year to the British Government for each pearl boat of which the safety at sea should be guaranteed. From 1835 onwards ' Trucial 'Oman ' becomes the most appropriate name for the country hitherto known as the Pirate Coast, and its chiefs may henceforth be correctly described as ' the Trucial Shaikhs.' The Restric- Another suggestion made by Captain Hennell in 1835 and well received by tive Line. the Shaikhs was that, for the protection of neutral commerce, a portion of the Guif 1836. on Persian side should be placed out of bounds for tribal warfare, even at the times when no truce existed. On the recommendation of Captain Hennell the Bombay Government agreed that the cruising of Arabian war-boats nearer to the Persian coast than the islands of Bu Musa and Sirri should at all times be inter dicted; but Major Morison, who succeeded Captain Hennell, was able to arrange with the Shaikhs for the substitution of Sir Bu Na'air in place of the islands previously mentioned, by which means the area liable to disturbance was still further reduced. In consequence of some irregular proceedings on the part of the Shaikh of Bahrain the restrictive line was afterwards authoritatively prolonged by way of Halul Island, of a point 10 miles off Ras Rakan, and of the island of Qraiyin, to Ras-az-Zor upon the coast near Kuwait. No formal agreement in regard to the line was ever executed; nor was any required. British relations with Trucial 'Oman, 1835-53. Series of short mari time truces, 1835-42. The Ten Years' Maritime Truce, 1843-53. During the eighteen years which followed the conclusion of the first Maritime Truce, the relations of the Trucial Shaikhs towards the British Government and towards one another at sea continued to be regulated by the General Treaty of 1820, supplemented by a series of maritime truces similar in their terms to that of 1835. The second and third truces, concluded on the 13th of April 1836 and the 15th of April 1837 respectively, were apparently for not more than eight months each; but the period of the fourth, signed in 1838, was fixed, at the instance of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, at one year. Annual truces were arranged thereafter in 1839, 1840, 1841 and 1842; but on the expiration of the Truce of 1840 a slight interval occurred, by which the Shaikh of Sharjah profited to make a naval attack on the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. The establishment of permanent peace at sea having been proposed by Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar in 1837, the attention of the Bombay Government was directed to the question; and, in 1841, they expresesd a wish that a truce for more than a year might, if possible, be arranged. Although the Shaikhs as a whole were not adverse to a lengthened truce, considerable doubt was felt by Captain Hennell, the Resident, as to the expediency of any change; he feared that a prolonged or permanent maritime truce would impose an intolerable strain on the propensities of the Arabs to wrong-doing and retaliation, and might so lead to a breakdown of the whole trucial system; and he foresaw that it would operate to the disadvantage of the Qawasim, who w r ere predominant at sea but suffered severely from the depredations of the Bani Yas on land. It was also apprehended that the difficulty and responsibility of settling by peaceful means quarrels that would ordinarily be decided by the sword, a duty which would necessarily devolve on the British Government as guarantor of the truce, might prove excessive. In the end the matter was left by Government to the experience and discretion of Captain Hennell, who justified the confidence reposed in him by negotiating a truce, upon the usual conditions, for an extended period of 10 years from the 1st of June 1843. In the eyes of even the Qasimi Shaikh the prospect of an undisturbed pearl fishery year by year outdid in attractiveness the possibility of taking naval revenge at intervals upon his military rival the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.43 The idea underlying the Maritime Truces was, on the part of the British authorities, the prevention of piracy, as distinct from its punishment under the Treaty of 1820; and the truces were regarded as a natural corollary to the suppression of crime at sea, inasmuch as they provided a guarantee for the free exercise of other maritime callings by tribes formerly piratical. The result of the truces, within the limits which bounded them, was beneficial in the highest degree. The danger, at times apprehended, of hostilities at sea between a signatory and a non-signatory power never took actual shape; and from engaging as allies in the naval wars of non-sigantory powers, as one or more of them might have done upon opposite sides,—this being a case not provided for in their engagements,— the Trucial Shaikhs were firmly, and successfully dissuaded by the 'local British authorities. A point more than once debated in the early years of the trucial system was the proper treatment thereunder of attacks by land parties upon the crews of fishing boats drawn up in creeks or backwaters, often at a distance from their own port. It was held by the Resident, in whose view the Shaikhs eventually acquiesced, that such attacks were a form of land warfare and as such were not prohibited by the terms of the Maritime Truce. Trivial cases of aggression, chiefly at the pearl banks, by boat upon boat were still not infrequent; they were almost invariably due to the absconding of indebted divers or other pearl operatives from the jurisdiction of one Shaikh to that of another, and they generally took the form of an attempt to capture the debtor, or to recover the amount of his debt, from the boat or the tribe to which he had attached himself. The settlement of such cases was felt to be a delicate matter, for enforcement of extradition by the British authorities might involve a high degree of interference on their part in local affairs and might destroy an important safe guard against oppression of their subjects by the Shaikhs. Endeavours were accordingly made to induce the Shaikhs to come to an understanding on the subject, independently of any guarantee by the British Government for its observance; but they failed, partly because of the reluctance of the Arab to surrender in any circumstances the fugitive who has taken refuge with him, and partly in consequence of an idea entertained by each chief that his own government was the most attractive to strangers and would be the chief loser by a check upon migration. For the solution of this difficulty, finally attained in 1879, the time was not yet ripe. The principal infractions of the Treaty of Peace of 1820 and of the Maritime Truce at the time in force may now be placed on record; but in doing so it is necessary to distinguish between the two classes, for all aggressions at sea were now equally included in the piratical category. The much less serious character, on the whole, of the offences committed during this period is a clear testimony to the progress made, under the Treaty of Peace alone, in the years preceding. In 1837 an ordinary piracy was committed on a boat belonging to Bandar 'Abbas by inhabitants of Hairah village; but the Shaikh of Sharjah, whose subjects the pirates were, of his own accord compelled them to make restitution. In 1838 two Qasimi subjects, Sultan-bin-Sohar and Muhammad-bin-Sohar, brothers, attacked and plundered a Kharag boat at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, killing several persons; and they also looted, in the vicinity of Ras-al-Hadd, a vessel belonging to the Batinah coast. Sultan, having been captured at Lingeh, was delivered over by the British Resident in the Persian Gull to the Shaikh of the Ka'ab, whose interest in the case will be explained further on; but Muhammad and a Nakhudawho had been associated with him in his misdeeds, on their surrender by Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar after severe treatment at Sharjah, were released by the British authorities with a slight additional punishment. Also in 1838, a Baqarah belonging to Khaburah in the 'Oman Sultanate was stealthily pursued by a Baqarah of Dibai to an anchorage at Barkah and there, at night but not unawares, attacked. Of nine men on board the Khaburah vessel, six were wounded and two subsequently died; but blood-money and other compensation were exacted in full from the aggressors by the British authorities through the Shaikh of Dibai. In 1840 some petty controversies took place on the pearl banks, and elsewhere at sea, between subjects of Abu Dhabi and Dibai and between subjects of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi; but they were unaccompanied by bloodshed or extreme violence and were adjusted by the' Resident under the terms of the Maritime Truce. More serious was the plunder by Bin-'Askar, a member of the rebellious Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas, in his flight with a number of companions from Abu Dhabi to Working of the periodical maritime truces.

The ruler of Dibai also became liable about this time for compensation on account of an Abu Dhabi boat, which some of his subjects, moving by water and not by land, had discovered in a creek and there broken up in reprisal tor a land raid by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. . ^ ■ 1841. In 1841 as the Dibai Shaikh persisted in his refusal to satisfy the claims outstanding against him, some of which arose from the petty disputes on the pearl banks already mentioned, a British squadron including the steam frigate ' Sesostris,' Commodore Brucks, was sent against ms town. After two shells from the 8-inch guns of the Sesostris ' had been fired over the place, he consented to pay $400 as compensation, and to surrender the Baqarahs brought by Bin-'Askar from Abu Dhabi, with their fittings. In the same year a boat belonging to a respectable member of the 'Amair of Hasa was plundered by pirates while stranded between Zakhnuniyah Island and Bahrain, one of the crew being killed and others wounded; and, as the criminals were shown to be Manasir and Bam Yas of the Hawamil section, a demand was made on the Snaikh ot Abu Uhabi for redress. He at once took personal action by sea and other vigorous action bv land against the offending communities, with the result that, notwitnstandmg the remoteness of their habitat, one of their boats was destroyea and five ol their bad characters were captured together with their families and 50 camels. 1844. In 1844 a Qasimi subject having seized a person Oi the Ka ab tribe trom a Dibai boat on the pearl banks, as related further on, some men of Dibai ventured to retaliate by plundering a Baqarah of Sharjah; but the Shaikh of Dibai, Maktum-bin-Butai, who had profited by experience and was now a thorough-going supporter of British policy, repudiated the act, restored the property taken, and, after punishing the perpetrators, obliged them to lodge security for their future aood behaviour with the British Residency Agent at Sharjah. The Ka ab case abovementioned and some others which had occurred at the pearl fishery ma e i^ necessary for the Resident, Colonel Hennell, to enforce respect for the Ten Years Maritime Truce, then recently concluded, by demanding reparation and security for the future from the aggressors, who were subjects of Sharjah; and, with the ready concurrence of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, these were immediately altorded. Meanwhile a fresh claim against Sharjah had arisen through the conduct ot an infuriated pearl diver of that port, who, after firing his matchlock on an Amjan boat boarded it and did some execution among the crew with a spear and an iron mace; but the further requisition on the Shaikh ot Sharjah which this mciaent necessitated was satisfied with the same alacrity as the former. In both cases the demands of the Resident were conveyed to Sharjah by a ship of war. 1845. At the beginning of 1845 an affair occurred which illustrated in a remarkable manner the growth of a more orderly spirit, in matters maritime, among the Shaik s of Trucial 'Oman. Two vessels with rice, bound from Lingeh to Sharjah, attempted to make the 'Ajman creek in a storm; one was wrecked at the entrance, but the other succeeded, with the loss of a part ot her cargo, in reaching the inner harbour. Here she would certainly have been plundered but for the exertions of the Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz, and his brother, who, hastening to the beach and drawing their swords, swore to cut down the first man who should tamper wit the vessel or her cargo. For his spirited conduct on this occasion the Shaik received through the Resident the special thanks and commendations o Government. . , , 1849-50 1849 and 1850 a number of claims relating to the seizure and counter- seizure of slaves from boats at sea arose between the people of Abu Dhabi and Dibai; but, with the assistance of the Resident, they were all satisfactorily adjusted. In the'autumn of 1850, however, a case of a gravity now unusual occurred in the capture of a Hamriyah boat and the murder of two of her crew by subjects ol Abu Dhabi. The 'Tigris,' Lieutenant Manners, and the 'Euphrates,' Lieutenant Tronson, were at once despatched to Abu Dhabi town and intimidated the Shaikh by approaching within effective range of the shore, an operation hitherto unattempted at Abu Dhabi; and, perhaps in consequence of this manoeuvre, they had no difficulty in obtaining satisfaction of the claim that they brought, which was for $600 as blood-money and the restoration of the boat and property taken. 1852 In the spring of 1852 a piracy was committed in Zanzibar waters, upon a Zanzibar craft, by a Baghlah of which the owner resided at Ras-al-Khaimah; but the slowness of communication in those days between Bushehr and East Africa45 greatly protracted the case, and at the time of the conclusion of the Perpetual Treaty of Peace in 1853 is was still unsettled. The Qasimi Shaikh at first sought to evade responsibility on the plea that the entire crew of the pirate boat were natives of Qasbiyat in Batinah, and therefore subjects of Masqat; but in the end he seems to have agreed to pay whatever compensation might be assessed. Like wise in the spring of 1852, a boat, belonging to Bani Yas seceders established at Dohah in Qatar but carrying passengers for Dibai, was seized off Abu Dhabi town, and then and there appropriated with all that she contained. This affair being regarded not as a legitimate act of sovereignty over rebellious subjects but as an infraction of the Maritime Truce, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was immediately called to account; and, though he had in the beginning professed to act under an authorisation by the Wahhabi Amir to coerce the dissident Bani Yas by confiscating their boats, he found no difficulty in accommodating himself to the Resident's demands, made known to him through Commodore Robinson. The Native Agent established at Sharjah m 1823 was now, apparently, the medium of all ordinary communications between the Resident and the Trucial Shaikhs. The incumbent during a considerable part of the formative period now under consideration, when the personal character of the functionary must have been a matter of great importance, was one Mulla Husain. The relations of Mulla Husain with Shaikh Salih, a brother of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, who acted as Deputy- Governor of the town of Sharjah until 1838 when he was superseded, were extremely cordial; and the removal of Salih was accordingly regarded by the British authorities with some dissatisfaction. In 1852 the relations between the Sharjah Shaikh and the Residency Agent, then Haji Ya'qub, to whom insults followed by reparation were twice offered, became exceedingly strained: this state of matters was partly due to revelations made by the Agent in connection with the slave trade, and it was aggravated by an order of the Court of Directors, that compensation payable to persons under Sharjah jurisdiction should not in future be handed to the Shaikh for disbursement. The order in question, which was issued in contrariety to the advice of the Resident, seemed to furnish a clue to a charge of misappropriating money which, among others, the Shaikh levelled at the Agent. The article in the General Treaty of Peace referring to the slave trade, on which Government in 1823 had placed a somewhat restricted interpretation, was expanded during the period now in question by three separate treaties concluded with the Trucial Shaikhs. . . , ^ • A i The first of these, signed in 1838, conferred on British Government cruisers the ri^ht to detain and search, anywhere at sea, vessels belonging to the ports ol the signatories which might be suspected of carrying off or embarking slaves, also the further riaht of seizing and confiscating such vessels in event of suspicion found correct. It does not appear that the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain subscribed this agreement. .. . , r i u The second treaty, that of 1839, conceded similar rights of detention and search over a part of the Indian Ocean in regard to vessels suspected of being engaged in the slave trade, and authorised the confiscation of the same with their cargoes should they be found carrying slaves. This treaty contained an expiess declaration that Somalis were ' Hurr ' or free and therefore not liable to enslavement, and it made the sale of Somalis punishable. It is not clear that this treaty was formally accepted by the Shaikh of 'Ajman. ,, i -r • i cu *i Uo The third and last treaty, dated 1847 and signed by all the Trucial Shaikhs, prohibited the exportation of slaves from the coasts of Africa and elsewhere on board vessels belonging to the signatories or their subjects or dependents, ana it conferred on British warships the power to detain and search suspected vessels anywhere at sea, and to seize and confiscate the same on proof of the prohibi.ion having been violated by their means. .u ^ ^ u From the wording of these engagements it would appear that they bore no special reference to the slave trade in the Persian Gulf, but were rather adjuncts to larger schemes for the suppression of the trailic on the coast of Alnca.

July 1839. almost exclusively with the Wahhabis or, at first, with the Egyptians, by whose power that of the Wahhabis was for a time superseded in Central Arabia. In 1839—in disregard of a pledge not to extend his conquests in the direction of the Persian Gulf, given in 1838 by Muhammad 'Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, to Colonel Campbell, the representative of the British Government in Cairo—the Egyptians occupied Hasa, appeared to contemplate the reduction of Bahrain, and despatched an agent to prepare their way among the tribesmen of Trucial 'Oman. These steps provoked countermoves on the part of the British Government, who felt their influence in the Gulf to be imperilled by the progress of the Egyptians; and in February 1839 the Political Resident at Bushehr was expressly instructed to exert his influence for the purpose of checking their further encroachments. With the same object a visit was paid to the coast of Trucial 'Oman by Sir F. Maitland, the British Naval Commander-in-Chief in the East, in H.M.S. ' Wellesley'; and the Trucial Shaikhs, in the presence of Captain T. Edmunds, Assistant Political Resident, who accompanied the cruise, solemnly undertook to hold no friendly relations with the emissary of the Egyptians, but on the contrary to oppose him. Nowithstanding this promise the Egyptian agent, who was no other than the former Wahhabi representative Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq, was allowed by Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar to remain at Sharjah, where, on his arrival in March 1839. a fortified house and tower had been placed at his disposal by the Shaikh; and from this point of vantage Sa'ad at once began to intrigue, calling on the Nairn tribe through Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar to surrender Baraimi for occupation by a garrison of Wahhabis, whom he had brought with him, and opening a direct correspondence with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, whose co-operation with themselves, in view of his previous steady opposition to Central Arabian influences, had been confidently anticipated by the British authorities. On the Na'im, who had but recently obtained or recovered possession of Baraimi, the threats of the Egyptian agent produced no effect, and the Na'im were encouraged in their defiant attitude by Saiyid Hamud-bin-'Azzan of Sohar, who immediately sent his own brother Qais with 200 men to their assistance; but by Shaikh Khalifah-bin-Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi the advances of Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq were cordially received. I he situation vis a vis of the Egyptians was now so unsatisfactory that Captain Hennell, the Political Resident, resolved on a personal visit to Bahrain and Trucial 'Oman; he arrived off the coast of the latter on the 1st of July 1839 in the H.E.I. Company's Steamer ' Hugh Lindsay,' of which the novel and surprising evolutions were not without their influence on the disaffected Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.* Captain Hennell's enquiries showed that the Shaikhs of Dibai and Umm-al-Qaiwain were unfavourably disposed towards the Egyptians, but that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was using every endeavour to supplant the Shaikh of Sharjah in Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq's favour, which Sultan-bin-Saqar on his part was doin^ his utmost to retain. From each of these four chiefs the Resident obtained a general written agreement to support the policy of the British Government and to resist that of the Egyptians; and in the case of Sultan-bin-Saqar a further clause was added, by which the Shaikh bound himself not to enter into any correspondence or treaty with Muhammad Ali of Egypt, his dependents, or any other foreign power without the consent of the British Government, and to regard the friends and enemies of the British as his own. The Shaikh of Sharjah was also furnished, at his own request, with letters from the Resident to himself and to Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq representing the advisability of the return of the latter to Najd; and, to satisfy the Shaikh s demands for British support, the Resident promised that, in case compliance with policy enjoined should involve him in hostilities, he should be supplied with such munitions of war as might be necessary and proper: this undertaking Captain Hennell offered to confirm in writing on the expulsion of Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq. Meanwhile an appeal for help against Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq had reached Captain Hennell from the Shaikhs of Baraimi, to which that officer replied encouraging them to maintain their independence, by holding out hopes that an Agent would be sent to reside with them, and by promising to supply them with ammunition, if attacked because of having conformed to his advice. The Resident's letter addressed to Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq contained a reference to these negotiations, and indicated that the Na'im of Baraimi had been taken under British protection pending a settlement between the British and Egyptian Governments. * The ' Hugh Lindsay,' Lieutenant Campbell, drew only eleven feet of water, and the power of the vessel to advance up a narrow channel against the wind greatly impressed the Arabs.47 The whole of Captain Hennell s proceedings were confirmed, and his zeal and energy were highly applauded, by the Governor-General of India; but the project of extending British protection to Baraimi, indicated in the Resident's letter to Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq, was negatived, along with certain other of his proposals for more active measures against the Egyptians and their supporters in Eastern Arabia. The Government of India considered that the larger question of Egyptian encroachments was one for the British Cabinet; and it is probable, moreover, that the anxieties of the first war in Afghanistan had by this time begun to cramp their policy in other directions; but the Resident was authorised to pursue, and, even to extend, the policy of distributing ammunition, etc., for use against the Egyptians. The local results of Captain Henneli's visit were not entirely satisfactory; for, though the Egyptian agent now took his departure for 'Oqair, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, in violation oi L the spirit of his freshly-formed obligations and in the interest —as was supposed—of Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq, proceeded in person against the Na'lm of Baraimi; but the Na'im, though disappointed in this emergency of the help of the Shaikh of Sharjah, stood firm and even repulsed the attacks of Khalifah-bin- Shakhbut with such vigour as to make him desirous of peace for the sake of his Bedouin supporters. At this juncture the Resident intervened and required the Shaikh to make such reparation as should be satisfactory to the Na'im within three months, on pain of being considered an enemy to the British Government and of rendering himself liable for the payment of a lump sum of $1,000 as com pensation to the Na'im; and eventually Shaikh Khallfah was able to produce a letter from the Na'im Shaikhs certifying that their claims had been satisfied and amity restored. In January 1840 Captain Hennell revisited the coast of Trucial 'Oman and held a meeting at 'Ajman with the Shaikhs of Baraimi, whose position he was anxious to strengthen; the principal figure among the Shaikhs was Hamud-bin- Sarur of the Shawamis division of the Na'im, the holders of the Baraimi forts. The Resident was able to effect a defensive alliance against all enemies between the Na'im and the Dhawahir inhabiting the Oasis, whose mutual hostility had hitherto been a source of weakness; but his efforts to reconcile the Na'im with their neighbours the Bani Qitab were not equally successful. A judicious distribution of rice, money and ammunition, which next took place, was designed to illustrate the advantages of the British connection and was so regulated as to make it clear that the favours of Government would be reserved for its sincere supporters. On the conclusion of these proceedings Captain A. Hamerton, an officer of the Kharag Field Force who was soon after selected to be Political Agent at Masqat, travelled from Sharjah to Baraimi under the protection of Hamud-bin- Sarur, regaining the coast at Sohar in Batinah. He found the defences of Baraimi to consist of a main fort on the south side of the place, built of sun-dried bricks and about 60 paces square, and of a smaller one, about 300 paces to the north wards: Both of these were constructions of Mutlaq the Wahhabi. The Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dibai did their utmost, by means of intrigues, to prevent Captain Hamerton's journey. On his return to Hasa, Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq seems to have incurred the distrust of his employers and to have been sent by them under surveillance to Riyadh; but not long afterwards the Egyptian occupation came to an end, and in May 1840 the Egyptian troops were in full retreat from Najd. The Egyptians at their withdrawal had installed Khalid as ruler of Najd, and reports soon became current that the new Amir cherished designs upon the 'Oman. Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq probably still maintained a correspondence with the Trucial Shaikhs; and in 1841 a letter addressed to him by the Shaikh of Sharjah fell into the hands of the Na'im of Baraimi, who found that it related to a project for their own destruction. In November 1841, the Amir Khalid being then at Hofuf in Hasa and his movements indicating an intention to proceed against 'Oman, the remonstrances of the British Government were conveyed to him through Lieutenant Jopp, who landed at 'Oqair and, after visiting the Amir at his headquarters, returned to the coast at Qatif. The Amir in his reply denied that he entertained any designs on 'Oman; but his continuance in power after this event was so brief as to leave it uncertain whether his assurances had been sincere. 'Abdullah, the successor of Khalid, during his brief tenure of power, opened a correspondence with the Trucial Shaikhs, in which he announced his intention of sending Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq as his agent to Baraimi; but his letters, except that Policy of the Indian Government.

Temporary expulsion of the Wahhabis from Baraimi by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, 1848-49. which he had addressed to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, were obtained by Colonel Robertson, the British Politicai Resident, who remonstrated agajnst his proceedings on the ground that they might lead to a revival ol piracy. Abdullah, in reply professed his abhorrence of piracy; but he did not fail to claim the people of Trucial 'Oman as his subjects. , ^ - In July 1843, immediately on his return to power, Faisal, the restored Amir of Najd informed the Shaikh of Oman by lettei that it was his intention at the end of the hot weather to send a force under Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq to take possession of the province. Alarmed by these threats the Na'irn of Baraimi who had ere now bv lawless acts estranged their former ally Saiyid Hamud ot Sohar applied for aid to the British Government; but in reply they were informed that the object of the assistance siven them in 1840 was to prevent the establishment ot the Ecvptians in the country, and that, this danger having been removed, it was now the intention of the British Government to withdraw from interference in the internal affairs of Arabia, At the same time iriendly communications of a general nature were passing between the Bushehr Residency and Riyadh. Early in 1845 Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq, accompanied by a small force, arrived once more in the neighbourhood of Baraimi. His hesitating approach betrayed some uncertainty as to the event; but on this occasion the Nairn and Dhawahir submitted without resistance, the Baraimi forts were at once placed in his hands, and the Trucial Shaikhs hastened to do him honour. Once firmly established in his old headquarters he devoted his attention, with results which are described in the history of the 'Oman Sultanate, chiefly to squeezing the richer principalities of Sohar and Masqat, but did not therefore neglect less valuable prey which lay within easy reach. On the contrary he at once engaged in intrigues to obtain possession of the town of Dhank in Dhahirah, and in October he made preparations to seize the small oasis oi Dhaid in the interior oi Trucial Oman, b^sid^s whi^h he proposed to build a fort on the coast in Zora, an insulated tract between 'Ajman and Hamrlyah. These proceedings and his general arrogance and rapacity soon brouaht into coalition against him on the east the Na'im tribe, the chief of Sohar, and the Mutawwa' class of 'Oman, and on the west all the Trucial Shaikhs except the chief of Umm-al-Qawain, who, probably with a view to some personal advantas^e. favoured the design of the Wahhabis on Dhaid. His enemies did not as yet venture on active opposition in arms to Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq: they chose at first the safer course of accusing him to his master of malversation in respect of the revenues that he collected,—a charge which, from his behaviour in a settlement with the Saiyids of Sohar and Masqat, seems to have been well founded. At this time the Wahhabi agent's direct communications with Central Arabia appear to have been broken bv the tribes, now hostile, that lay upon the route. Sa ad s departure from Baraimi for the court of the Amir, at which he had resolved to appear in person for the purpose of justifying his conduct, was countermandea at the last moment, on the unexpected arrival from Najd of an order confirming him in his appointment but requiring ot him an immediate remittance in mone\. With the assistance of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, who provided a vessel, he at once despatched a quantity of treasure by sea to Hasa. a u e The position of the Wahhabis at Baraimi remained unaltered until the 4tn oi May 1848, when Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Tahnun of Abu Dhabi, taking advantage ot the momentary absence of Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq and assisted by the Dhawahir trib^, suddenly captured a Wahhabi post in the Dhawahir country. Shaikh Said was at once joined by the Na'im and by a contingent for Sohar under the command of Saif-bin-Hamud of that place; the result was the capitulation, after a short struggle, of both the Wahhabi strongholds in Baraimi; and these were immediately occupied by the Abu Dhabi Shaikh, while Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq sought reluge at Sharjah. The son of the Sohar chief, in consequence of a misunderstanding, soon withdrew his support; and the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dibai and 'Ajman,* irritated at the pre-eminence so easily acquired by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, combined with the Wahhabis; but Shaikh Sa'id continued to maintain his position at Baraimi with boldness and success. At length, in February 1849, peace was arranged between the contending parties by an emissary of the Sharif of Makkan, the conditions were apparently unfavourable to Shaikh Sa'id, for they involved the restoration of the Baraimi forts to the Wahhabi agent and a general return to the status quo ante helium. * According to one account the Shaikh of 'Ajman (like the Shaikh of Umm-al -Quiwain) refused to take part against Sald-bin-Tahnun.49 In November 1849 the Shaikhs of Dibai and Sharjah strongly urged the Wahhabi Amir to settle the emigrant Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas under his own protection at Khor-al-'Odaid; but this intrigue failed in consequence of prompt and successful measures by which the Abu Dhabi Shaikh obliged the seceders to return to their homes and their allegiance. In March 1850 Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Tahnun, who had since the peace of 1849 Various been carrying on negotiations with Saiyid Thuwaini, regent of Masqat, for a fresh attack on the Wahhabis, sent a contingent of 400 Bani Yas and Manasir to assist theTrudal' his ally in the defence of Shinas against the Qawasim, and himself began an attack shaikhs to on the Wahhabi position at Baraimi by destroying the irrigation channels of that expel the settlement. An interruption of his operations was threatened by the collection at Wahhatns, Dhaid of a large force from Sharjah, Dibai, 'Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain; but K5U - 5 • this army having proceeded, after much discussion among the leaders, to Batinah to take part in the struggle there between the Saiyids Thuwaini and Qais, Shaikh Sa'id was left free to prosecute his desultory, and jn the end ineffectual, operations against Baraimi. In the following November a combined but apparently fruitless attack was made by the Qawasim, Bani Yas and Na'im upon the Najdi garrison of Baraimi. This attack was the precursor of a regular combination in 1851 between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi against the Wahhabis; but the alliance was due, on the part of Shaikh Sultan, merely to jealousy of the favour now shown by the Wahhabis to the Shaikh of Dibai, and it was barren of results. In the spring of 1853 the Trucial Shaikhs, with the exception of Sa'ld-bin-Buti Sojoiirn of of Dibai who deputed a relation to represent him, waited in person upon 'Abdullah- bin-Faisal, then recently arrived in Baraimi as the representative of his father the Wahh abi,' Wahhabi Amir; and so assiduous were they in their attentions to him, and in their at Baraimi, rivalry for his good graces, that the presence of all upon the coast was not secured 1853. without some difficulty by Captain Kemball, when he arrived there in May 1853 for the purpose of concluding a Perpetual Treaty of Peace. The principal object of 'Abdullah-bin-Faisal during his stay at Baraimi was, as explained in the history of the 'Oman Sultanate, to' wring the utmost possible concessions from the unfortunate ruler of Masqat,—a policy in which, needless to say, warm y encouraged by Shaikh Sultan of Sharjah. Shaikh Said of Abu Dhabi on the other hand, exerted himself to prevent an invasion ol Batmah by the Wahhabi and Qasimi forces, such as was proposed and at one time all but undertaken, and the terms of peace, the most favourable that 'Abdullah could be persuaded to grant, were arranged at Sohar by the instrumentality of this chief and of a certain Ahmad-as-Sadairi, who had now apparently succeeded to the position of Wahhabi agent at Baraimi formerly held by Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq.

Relations with Bahrain. from sending help to the A1 'All of Charak, his ancestral dependents; and in 1837 the Shaikh of Sharjah was similarly prevented from supporting the people of Tavuneh against those of Charak. There was occasional friction between the Ka'ab Shaikh of Persian 'Arabistan and the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman. The seizure of a Ka'ab subject by Qasimi pirates in 1838, together with the steps taken in connection with it by the British authorities, has been mentioned in a previous paragraph; but this affair, though the victim was among the wealthiest and most valued of Shaikh Thamir's supporters, gave rise to no serious difficulties, for the Ka'ab chief, mollified by the surrender of the chief criminal, accepted the assurances of the British Resident that the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Lingeh and their subjects as a whole were innocent. The Qawasim, apparently expecting severe reprisals, had in the meanwhile formed their Basrah-bound vessels, 22 in all, into a fleet sailing together for mutual protection. In December 1844 a case much more difficult of settlement arose through the seizure at Muhammareh of a Batil belonging to Abu Dhabi; this act was com mitted under the orders of Shaikh Paris, the Ka'ab chief of the day, who justified it by reference to an untenable claim of his own, more than 30 years old, against the Bani Yas tribe. After a protracted controversy, of which the particulars are described in the history of 'Arabistan, the Batil was returned to the owners through the British authorities in May 1845. The intervention of the Trucial Shaikhs in Bahrain affairs was now discountenanced by the British Government in the same manner as their inter ference in Persia. In 1843 permission to assist the ex-chief of Bahrain, 'Abdullah- bin-Ahmad, was positively refused to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dibai by whom it had been sought, and the more prudent Shaikh of Abu Dhabi himself voluntarily declined to listen to overtures from the other contending faction in Bahrain. In July 1851, however, the questions pending between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Wahhabi Amir were amicably adjusted by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, in whose conduct upon this occasion there was nothing reprehensible. Leading motives. Relations between Sharjah, Abu Dhabi and Dibai, 1838. 1839. 1840. Internal affairs of Trucial 'Oman, 1835-53. The internal history of Frucial 'Oman at this time, relating chiefly to petty wars among the principalities, is confusing and monotonous; but it is not altogether without meaning or explanation. The central fact is a contest for the general paramountcy between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi: a contest in which, after the first, the power of Sharjah appeared relatively to decline, and one by which the Shaikh of Dibai, who held the balance of power, profited so largely and so unscrupulously that the principals from time to time forgot their feud in an endeavour to exterminate him by united action. Besides hostilities traceable to the antagonism between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi there was, however, much desultory fighting due to predatory raids and the reprisals which they provoked; and some incidents of considerable importance arose out of aggressions by the Shaikh of Sharjah on his smaller neighbours. About 1840 it was clearly the ambition of the Shaikh of Sharjah to reduce Umm- al-Qaiwain, 'Ajman, and even Dibai to dependence upon himself. InJVlay 1838 Shaikh Khallfah of Abu Dhabi, in whose mind the secession of the A1 Bu Falasah to Dibai still rankled deeply, made a sudden raid upon that place in the absence of the inhabitants at the pearl banks, captured a tower upon the sea face, and, alter pladng a garrison of his own in it, withdrew. On receiving news of the incident the A1 Bu Falasah at once returned from the pearl fishery and, assisted by Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar of Sharjah, dislodged the intruding Bani Yas after three days' operations; they also destroyed the tower. Bickerings followed, but in the end a settlement w r as effected, and the boats of Dibai and Abu Dhabi were enabled to return to the pearl banks before the close of the season. In 1839 a blood-feud arose between the people of Dibai and those of Umm-al-Qaiwain; it led to hostilities between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Umm-al-Qaiwain and is therefore treated of in a later paragraph. A year later the hand of Maktum-bin-Buti, Shaikh of Dibai, was shown in the domestic affairs of the Qasimi principality by Shaikh Saqar-bin-Sultaivs proclaiming his independence, in the town of Sharjah, of his father, the Qasimi Shaikh; and on the failure of this coup d'etat, during the continuance of which the influence ol Shaikh Maktum had dominated Sharjah, the rebellious son was51 provided at Dibai with a refuge from his father's vengeance. Seemingly stung to fury by these proceedings, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar underwent a reconciliation with his arch enemy, Shaikh Khalifah of Abu Dhabi, and it was agreed between them that, on the capture of Dibai, the town should be completely destroyed and the inhabitants obliged to remove to Abu Dhabi or Sharjah; the Shaikh of Umm-al- Qaiwain also, having been placated by Shaikh Sultan, was persuaded to join in the arrangement. When matters had reached this point the Shaikh of Shariah, with a falseness almost incredible even in one so celebrated for that quality, suddenly accepted the submission of the Shaikh of Dibai, which was accompanied by a gift of $1,000, and withdrew, leaving his indignant allies to conclude the affair as they best could. In 1841 Dibai was much weakened by the exodus of 500 discontented A1 Bu 1841. Mahair, who settled at Sharjah; and at the same time the prevalence of a virulent fever in the town of Dibai caused a number of the inhabitants to desert it and settle temporarily, with the written permission of Shaikh Sultan, at the place called Dairah which in 1824-1827 had been the cause of a serious dispute between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. Finding Dibai almost undefended in consequence of these events and of the departure of the men of the Al Bu Falasah to the pearl fishery, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, after securing the neutrality of the Bani Qitab and other Bedouin tribes, made a dash with 150 men upon the town, which he took and plundered, ravaging the date groves, destroying all provisions found, and burning a Batll, the property of Shaikh Maktum, on board of which two men also were killed. The Shaikh of Dibai at once applied to the Shaikh of Sharjah, who came to his aid with 200 men; but, while the allied force did not venture to attack the invaders, now in occupation of Jumairah, the enterprising Khalifah-bin-Shakhbut sent out a raiding party which looted the village of Khan in their rear, carrying off fifteen slaves, and returned to headquarters in safety. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi then retired to his own territory, whence he afterwards attempted a surprise on the towns of Dibai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah; but this time, finding the enemy everywhere prepared to receive him, he was obliged to retreat with the loss of a few men and of his own riding camel. In April of the following year it was suggested to Shaikh Khalifah that he, 1842. with the other Trucial Shaikhs, should enter into an engagement to abstain from mutual aggressions by land as well as by sea during the approaching pearl season; but the Shaikh, who was still smarting under the ill success ol his latest raid, declined to consider the suggestion, and even proceeded to detach Shaikh Maktum from Shaikh Sultan as a preliminary to a fresh attack on the latter. He remained quiescent, however, during the summer months; and in October 1842, unusual cordiality then prevailing between himself and Shaikh Maktum, the latter under took to arrange a peace with Sharjah; but the Sharjah Shaikh refused to abandon his enmity with the Saiyid of Masqat, which was an indispensable condition, and the negotiations accordingly failed. In March 1843 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi paid a visit to the Shaikh of Dibai, 1843. and, much to the chagrin of the Shaikh of Sharjah, their friendship appeared to be confirmed. A raid by 150 camel-riders of the Bani Yas was next conducted by Sultan, a brother of the Abu Dhabi Shaikh, against the allies ol the Qawasim; and, all in the space of seven days, the Bani Qitab had three men killed and 70 camels taken, a caravan bound from Baraimi to Sharjah was plundered, and three of the Na'im were slain, the raiders themselves returning home with the loss of only two men killed and two wounded. In July a hollow peace put an end, temporarily, to the war; but in August, at the instigation it was believed of the Shaikh of Dibai, Shaikh Khalifah-bin- Shakhbut with a considerable force of horse and camelry ravaged the territories of the Bani Qitab, Ghafalah and Na'im and carried off a number of their camels, which had been collected for safety at Dhaid while the owners themselves were absent on a foray in the Batinah district. Promises to restore the booty taken were given by the Bani Yas, but they were not fulfilled. In November 1843, in consequence of an attack by Ghafalah on a Dibai caravan, Shaikh Maktum carried fire and sword into the country of that tribe and of the Na'im, who were allies of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, and the result was an approach to a rupture between the two Shaikhs; but the Qasimi Shaikh from prudential motives so hung back that even the Ghafalah, incensed at his desertion, turned their arms against him and threatened to transfer their allegiance to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. An inhabitant of Sharjah having been killed by the hand 48533 I52 of a brother of Shaikh Maktum, a crisis again occurred, and again passed over harmlessly. Finally, a direct collision took place in the interior between the Ghafalah and the Shaikh of Dibai and several men were killed on either side; the Shaikh was victorious, but lost the sight of one eye. 1844. In July 1844 the Shaikh of Sharjah set about trying to recover his lost influence with the tribes of the interior; but in Bedouin state-craft he showed himself no match for Khalifah-bin-Shakhbut, who, in the course of a summer tour, succeeded in attaching to his cause even the tribes that he had most recently plundered. At Baraimi the Abu Dhabi Shaikh held a gathering of his friends and allies, which was attended by Saiyid Hamud-bin-'Azzan, ihe ruler of Sohar, and Saiyid Qahtan- bin-Saif, Deputy-Governor of Shinas; but Shaikh Maktum of Dibai, who was invited to present himself for a settlement of his differences with the Ghafalah, thought it more prudent to excuse himself and sent his brother Sa'id in his room. 1846. In 1846 the whole of the Trucial Coast was involved in war by the ambition of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, whose object still appeared to be the annexation of Umm-al-Qaiwain and 'Ajman and the crippling of Dibai. The threatened chiefs combined in self-defence against the Shaikh of Sharjah, who in his turn persuaded Sa'id-bin-Tahnun, a new Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, unversed as yet in Qasimi duplicity, to enter with him into a counter-alliance. We are not here concerned with the conduct of the Umm-al-Qaiwain or of the 'Ajman Shaikh, though the steadfastness of the former had a strong influence on events, but shall confine our attention to the dispute between Sharjah and Dibai and its results. The immediate cause of quarrel was a resolve by Sultan-bin-Saqar to set limits to the growth of Dibai by building a number of towers at Abu Hail, a place situated on the coast of his own territory but distant only five miles from Dibai, which proceeding Shaikh Maktum felt it necessary at all costs to prevent. Hostilities had scarcely begun, when they were interrupted by the arrival off Sharjah of a British and Indian naval squadron under the command of Commodore Sir H. Blackwood, R.N., who urged the combatants to suspend matters until a reference should have been made to the Resident. To this suggestion they agreed, but on the departure of the ships Shaikh Sultan immediately broke his promise and recommenced building at Abu Hail; and Captain Kemball, who arrived in March 1846 to promote a reconciliation on behalf of the Resident, found war fairly begun and his own best efforts of no avail. A day or two after the Assistant Resident's departure the situation was greatly altered by the death of Saqar, son of the Sharjah Shaikh, who was killed in an attack on Umm-al-Qaiwain; and, at the request of Shaikh Sultan himself, a truce for more than 6 months, to the 12th of November following, was mediated by Commodore Hawkins. On the part of the principal mover in the matter the observance of this truce was merely nominal, for Shaikh Sultan at once resumed his building operations and excluded Dibai subjects from Sharjah, besides instigating the Abu Dhabi chief to insult the Shaikh of Dibai and to harass the Bedouin allies of Umm-al-Qaiwain; and on one occasion over 20 men of the latter, belonging to the Ghafalah tribe, were reported to have been butchered in consequence of his incitements. On the expiration of the land truce the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah again met, and it was decided first to reduce Dibai; but Shaikh Sultan, seized by a sudden fear lest Shaikh Sa'id should retain the place, if captured, in his own hands, changed his mind and insisted that Umm-al-Qaiwain should be the first objective of the combined force. 1847. Hereupon the allies opened separate negotiations with Shaikh Maktiim, their intended victim, who threw himself into the arms of the Sharjah Shaikh and in February or March 1847 concluded a peace with him, while with Abu Dhabi he remained at war. The reason of Shaikh Maktum's choice appears to have been that Shaikh Sultan now promised to destroy the towers at Abu Hail,—an under taking which he did not fulfil or even intend to fulfil,—while Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, pressed upon him a disagreeable condition implying forgiveness of the obnoxious Bani Qitab. 184^ Matters remained stationary until the 12th of January 1848, when intercourse between 'Ajman and Sharjah having been but lately resumed, a treacherous attempt was made by the governor of Sharjah, Shaikh 'Abdullah-bin-Sultan, a worthy son of his father, to possess himself of the 'Ajman fort. The scheme miscarried and was at once disavowed by the elder Qasimi Shaikh; but the disgust which it excited was such as to throw the four other Trucial Shaikhs into combination against Sultan-bin-Saqar and his sons. No active retaliation however was attempted.♦ X 53 V The relations of the Shaikhs with one another during the next two years in Baraimi and Batinah, have been partially described above, and at home no move ments of importance took place among them. It may be added here that, during the occupation of Baraimi by Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Tahnun, his relations with the Sharjah and Dibai Shaikhs were much strained. In July 1848 he required the former, as his ally, to break with the latter—a requisition with which Shaikh Sultan merely pretended to comply; and in December the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dibai, and possibly 'Ajman combined to recover Baraimi for the Wahhabis, but the force which they assembled never, apparently, reached its destination. In 1851, notwithstanding the efforts of Shaikh Maktum to prevent it, peace was concluded between Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Tahnun and Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar; but in 1852 Shaikh Sultan, who had interfered in the domestic affairs of the Dibai principality, found himself confronted by a defensive alliance between the Shaikhs of Dibai, Abu Dhabi and Umm-al-Qaiwain. The aggressions of Shaikhs Sultan-bin-Saqar on the small neighbouring Shaikhdom of Umm-al-Qaiwain, the independence of which, notwithstanding his repudiation of suzerainty in 1832, he would willingly have destroyed, demand a short separate notice. In 1839, two inhabitants of Dibai having been slain in the desert by men of Umm-al-Qaiwain and others who mistook them for members of the Manaslr tribe, the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid, hastened to tender compensation through the Shaikh of Sharjah, for the share of his subjects in the deed; but his offer was not accepted, nor was the friendly intervention of the British Resident productive of any result. A raid was then made by the Shaikh of Dibai, with the consent of the Shaikh of Sharjah, upon the territory of Umm- al-Qaiwain; but it ended in the capture of six of the Dibai party by the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, who placed them in confinement and refused to let them go. Shaikh Saqar-bin-Sultan, son of the Qasimi chief, now openly sided with Shaikh Maktum of Dibai; and Umm-al-Qaiwain was approached by a joint force, which after drawing the defenders into the open by a simulated flight, inflicted on them a loss of 20 killed and many wounded. The affair ended with the release of the six prisoners and the payment of blood-money in the original case by the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. On the expiration of the current Maritime Truce in the following year. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, who was by no means satisfied with the blow which his son and ally had dealt to the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, made a well-organised effort to reduce that port. While he himself with 700 Bedouins invested the place by land, a fleet of 3 Baghlahs and 60 Baqarahs, commanded by Saqar-bin-Sultan and the Shaikh of Dibai and carrying 1,500 men, proceeded fo blockade it by sea; but a tower, situated at the entrance, prevented the boats from entering the back water or creek, without possession of which the blockade could not be made effective. An entrenchment covering the tower was taken by a landing party of the Qawasim, but they were beaten back from the tower itself with a loss of 8 men killed and 40 wounded; and meanwhile the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, with a view to relieving Umm-al-Qaiwain, had made an attempt to surprise the town of Dibai. In these circumstances the mediation of the British Resident was gladly accepted by the parties, and a formal treaty of alliance and friendship was concluded on the following conditions: that Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar should withdraw his demand for the destruction of a particular tower protecting the water supply of Umm-al- Qaiwain; that 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid should compensate the Qasimi Shaikh lor his loss in skirmishes previous to the siege; and that no fresh fortifications should be erected by the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. In 1841, encouraged by dissensions between the Qasimi Shaikh and his son Saqar, Shaikh 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid sounded the British Resident as to the permissibility of resuming work on certain fortifications, left incomplete at the time of the siege, upon the sea face of Umm-al-Qaiwain; but the project was severely discouraged by the Resident as involving a breach of the treaty mediated by himself. The Shaikh, however, disregarding the Resident's wishes, shortly proceeded to complete the unfinished towers and even build an additional one for the defence of the backwater. Upon this Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar immediately applied to the Resident for enforcement of the treaty; and in November 1842 the Assistant Resident was deputed to the coast of Trucial Oman to enquire into the case. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain was unable to justify, except as a precaution against treachery which he apprehended from Shaikh Sultan, his own open and undeniable violation of the treaty; not only did he refuse to dismantle the new works, but he even 1848-50. 1851-53.

Conflict between 'Ajman and Hamriyah, 1848. expressed an intention of building others; and, in effect, he said that he would only desist under compulsion. The Shaikh of Sharjah, with his usual acuteness, refused to discuss any compromise and appealed to the honour of the British officials. Eventually the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain was obliged to suspend his building operations, and the case was referred for the orders ot Government. In May 1843 the Assistant Resident, armed with authority from Government, again proceeded to the spot, and Shaikh 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid, until he found that coercion would be used if necessary, was just as obstinate as beiore; but the conclusion of the Ten Years' Maritime Truce, which took place at this time, deprived the question of its practical importance, and it was decided that, after the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain had fulfilled his obligations by destroying the works constructed in violation of the treaty, the treaty itself should be annulled and the Shaikhs and the British Government absolved from their mutual responsibilities. The British Agent was directed to remain at Umm-al-Qaiwain to witness the demolition of the towers, and their destruction was commenced; but, after one tower had been levelled to the ground, the Shaikh of Sharjah, at the intercession of the Shaikh of Dibai and not uninfluenced by a threat on the part of the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain to ruin the pearling season by beginning a war on land, agreed that the remainder should be spared—a concession which the British authorities readily confirmed. In 1844 Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar was driven by adverse winds to take refuge in the harbour of Umm-al-Qaiwain, and Shaikh 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid overlooking the past, invited him ashore and treated him as a distinguished guest during a night and day. This, however, seems to have been a mere incident ol Arab hospitality, for it led to no improvement of the bad relations between the two chiefs. In the general war which broke out along the Trucial Coast in 1846, chiefly in consequence of the ambition of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, the Shaikh of Umm- al-Qaiwain played an important part. In marked contrast with Shaikh 'Abdul Aziz of 'Ajman, the other member of the triple combination, who finding it to his advantage to do so soon changed sides, Shaikh 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid supported with unswerving loyalty his ally of Dibai; and by these two the war was carried to a not unsuccessful conclusion. Early in the operations an encounter took place in the neighbourhood of Umm-al-Qaiwain between a force under the personal command of the Shaikh and a raiding party of Bani Qitab and others accompanied by Saqar-bin-Sultan of Sharjah; in this affair, the son of the Qasimi Shaikh having been slain after a fierce struggle, the partisans of Sharjah were put to flight. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain was included in the peace of 1847; but, though he subsequently co-operated with the Qawasim in an expedition to Batinah he ever remained on his guard against the vengeance of the Shaikh Sharjah for the death of his son. It will be interesting, before leaving the subject of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar and his attempted aggrandisements, to notice some operations which he undertook in 1839 against the neighbouring Shihhi tribe. The Saiyid of Masqat is said to have admitted in 1836 the dependence of the Ruus-al-Jibal district on the Qasimi Shaikh; but the Shihuh, inhabiting the same, apparently held other views. One of their forts having fallen by treachery into the hands of Shaikh Sultan's repre sentative at Dibah and having been demolished by him, the Shihuh embarked on a series of raids and forays, to which the Qasimi Chief replied by unsuccessful land expeditions against their chief towns of Khasab and Kumzar. Shaikh Sultan had, in consequence of these reverses, resolved on a naval blockade of the Ruus- al-Jibal coast, when the success of the Egyptians in Najd drew his attention to a different quarter, and even caused him to take the initiative in seeking peace with the Shihuh. It remains to mention an isolated conflict; between the people of 'Ajman and those of Hamriyah; it did not, apparently, disturb the relations of 'Ajman with the Shaikhdom of Sharjah, to which Hamriyah belonged. In September 1848, on the death of Saif-bin-'Abdullah, Shaikh of Hamriyah, the inhabitants of that village elected one 'Abdullah as Shaikh in his place. This proceeding seems to have^ been resented by 'Abdul 'Aziz, Shaikh of 'Ajman, for he immediately set out to attack Hamriyah at the head of 400 men; but the 'Ajmani host, were routed at the first encounter by an inferior number of the people of Hamriyah, who pursued them back to the very gates of their own town. In this engagement Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz was killed and his brother Hamaid-bin-Rashid wounded, while the newly elected chief of Hamriyah also lost his life; and, besides the leaders, &lt;here were 26 men killed and 20 wounded on the side of 'Ajman and 5 killed and55 22 wounded on the side of Hamrlyah. 'Abdur Rahman, a son of Saif-bin- 'Abdullah, then became Shaikh of Hamrlyah; and Hamaid-bin-Rashid succeeded his deceased brother as Shaikh of 'Ajman. Perpetual Treaty of Peace, 4th May 1853. When the period of the Ten Years' Maritime Truce began to near its end, Captain A. B. Kemball, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, consulted the Shaikhs who were parties to the same regarding the conclusion in its place of a permanent peace at sea. The replies received were not unfavourable, and the project was strongly supported by the Government of Bombay; accordingly, at the beginning of May 1853, Captain Kemball, under the sanction of the Govern ment of India, proceeded in the ' Clive' to the Trucial Coast, where the negotiations were quickly and successfully completed. Experience had now convinced the Shaikhs of the benefit to all from unbroken peace at sea, and not even that pro forma opposition was encountered which had been anticipated on the part of the more powerful Shaikhs of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, the Shaikh of Sharjah being satisfied by an assurance that the signature of the new treaty would not debar him, in an extreme case, from defending his maritime possessions in the Gulf of 'Oman by naval means against the ruler of Masqat. The terms of the Perpetual Treaty of Peace, as it was styled, were similar to those of the Ten Years' Truce, but included, as an additional stipulation, that the ' perfect maritime truce ' now established ' for evermore ' should be watched over and enforced by the British Government. The treaty, which took effect from the 4th of May, was signed by the Shaikhs on various dates between the 4th and the 9th of that month. The continuance of a system of presents, which the Resident was accustomed to bestow at his periodical visits in recognition of good conduct on the part of the individual Shaikhs, was expressly sanctioned by the Government of India. PERIOD FROM THE PERPETUAL TREATY OF PEACE TO THE EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT, 1853-92. British relations with Trucial ? Oman, 1853-92. The term ' Maritime irregularitywhich after 1853 generally figures in Maritime official correspondence in place of the word ' piracy ', is significant of the great irregularities, and peaceful revolution which, by the firmness and moderation of the British political officers, had been gradually brought about in the Persian Gulf. On his first visit to the Trucial Coast after the conclusion of the Perpetual 1854. Peace, the Resident, Captain Kemball, found the Shaikhs confirmed in their ' attachment and devotion to the British Government' and in their resolution faithfully to observe their engagements. On this occasion only two slight cases of breach of the peace at sea came under his consideration, and they were easily settled. In January 1855 a Shu'ai belonging to one 'Abdul Kanm of Bahrain, having 1855-1856. been driven by a storm to take shelter near Khor-al-'Odaid, was attacked and plundered there by two Baghlahs of Abu Dhabi; in the fray Abdul Karim himself was wounded and one of his men was killed. The Shaikh ot Abu Dhabi, Zaid- bin-Khalifah, who had just succeeded to the Shaikhdom, at first demurred to settling the case on the ground that it had occurred under his predecessor; but, this plea having been disallowed, he complied with the demands made on him through Commodore Ethersey by paying full compensation for the robbery and $600 as Diyah or blood-money on account of the murdered man, and by causing the two offending Baghlahs to be burnt. A disturbance which took place at Hamrlyah in 1855 gave rise to several slight aggressions at sea, two of them upon stranger vessels belonging to the Batinah coast; but redress in these cases was easily obtained. In November 1855, while the ' Kallian ', a Bombay native vessel belonging to a Hindu British subject, was unloading her cargo at Sharjah, a storm arose and drove her on shore. On the wind abating a rabble from the town came down to the beach and plundered and partially destroyed her, besides tearing down a British flag which the Nakhuda had hoisted for her protection; and a second British flag having been hoisted, the Arabs began to abuse the British Government and violently assaulted one of the crew. A man-of-war was accordingly despatched to Sharjah with a demand for compensation, for the repair ol the vessel, and torthe punishment of the guilty parties; and, after a vain attempt by the Shaikh to present the case as one of wreck and to throw the blame upon Bedouins not amenable to his authority, these terms were substantially fulfilled. An ordinary case of the seizure of runaway divers upon the pearl banks was so energetically handled in this year by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who imprisoned the chief offender and returned the kidnapped divers to the Residency Agent at Sharjah, that Government authorised a special increase in the value of his next annual present. • • • ^ r , A peculiar case arose in July 1856 from the participation of a force, sent by sea from Sharjah, in an attempt to reinstate at Abu Dhabi Sa Td-bin-TahnUn, the ex-ruler of that place. The attack of the legitimists having failed, it was decided to treat the case as one of maritime aggression and to hold the Qasimi Shaikh partially responsible for the damage done in Abu Dhabi town, though this was to some extent the work of Bedouin allies whom the de facto Shaikh had found himself compelled to summon to his assistance. The fine on the Shaikh of Sharjah was fixed at $25,000, payable by instalments, of which it was intended to remit a portion should the attitude of the Shaikh be satisfactory; but his shifty conduct placed clemency out of the question, and this large sum was in the end exacted to the last dollar, the final payment not being received until May 1860. In 1857, as is more fully related in another place,* the Shaikh of Sharjah was prevented, on grounds of expediency and not under the Treaty of Peipetual Peace, which did not apply to the case, from taking action by sea against the Shihuh, with whom he was at war. In 1859 an atrocity occurred, which revived for a moment, the memories of former days. Three natives of Hasa, subjects of the Wahhabi Amir and passengers on a vessel of Dibai bound for Lingeh, were thrown overboard by the Nakhuda and crew, who desired to take possession of their valuables. Two were drowned: but the third member of the party, 'Abdullah-bin-Husain, managed to keep himself afloat until he was picked up by a vessel from Sur. Eventually he laid information before the Resident, Captain Felix Jones, I.N., who despatched Commodore Balfour with a squadron to require (1) the surrender for destruction of the boat in which the crime had been committed, (2) the payment of $1,800 as compensation for property taken, (3) the payment of $1,800 as blood-money on account of two murders and an attempted murder, and (4) the public execution of 'Obaid, the Nakhuda of the guilty vessel, or, in lieu thereof, the payment of a fine of $1,000. Prompt compliance of these terms was enforced by Commodore Balfour, an officer of very decided character, on the Shaikh of Dibai, the fine being accepted instead of the surrender of the chief murderer; but later in the year Captain Felix Jones, discovering that Muhammad-bin-Bazzan, another of the murderers, had returned to his home at Khasab, went there with Commodore Balfour and demanded his surrender under a penalty of $1,000. Muhammad-bin-Bazan was accordingly delivered up unconditionally by the elders of the town—the first instance, it wast stated, of such a surrender being made to the British authorities and, having been handed over to his sovereign, the Sultan of 'Oman, was blown from a gun at Masqat on the 21st of May 1860. In 1859 the surrender of seven Sharjah boats which had been guilty of piratical acts, apparently upon the Persian coast, was obtained by Commodore Jenkins, I.N., at 48 hours' notice; but the particulars of this case are not ascertainable. In 1860 the Shaikh of Hamiryah, after having in the previous year been obliged to pay up a small sum on account of a robbery committed at sea on board a vessel belonging to his port, was so ill-advised as to move by water to the assistance of his suzerain, the Shaikh of Sharjah, who was engaged in coercing some rebellious subjects at Khan and Abu Hail: this thoughtless act cost him $250. Two cases which occurred at Bakhah in 1859 or 1860 may, though they belong properly to the Ruus-al-Jibal district, be mentioned here as constituting breaches of maritime order on the coast immediately adjoining Trucial 'Oman; in the first a fugitive from Sha'am, at the instigation of the Shaikh of Bakhah, stole a Baqarah and some fishing nets from Sha'am and brought them to Bakhah, and in the second a shipwrecked crew, cast ashore at Bakhah, were robbed by the Shaikh of their few remaining effects. In each case the Shaikh, though he was not a signatory of any truce or peace and would at the present day be regarded as a dependent of the Sultan of Masqat, was called upon to pay a fine of $100. Payment of the first * The statement was not absolutely correct. It will be remembered that in 1835 two pirates were surrendered by the Bam Yas. t Vide page 623 ante.57 fine was refused by him to Lieutenant Dyer of the brigantine 'Tigris;' but the arrival of Commodore Balfour on the 15th of February 1860 with the steam frigate ' Semiramis ' and the 44 Elphinstone ' produced a satisfactory settlement, to which was annexed a warning to the Shaikh to be ' careful how he ever again refused any demand made on him by the Captain of one of Her Majesty's Indian Navy vessels.' In January 1860 the ' Fath-al-Khair ' of Lingeh, in endeavouring to enter I860, the harbour of Ras-al-Khaimah during a storm, ran aground and was at once surrounded, with felonious intent, by 15 or 20 armed boats commanded by Shaikh Ibrahim, a son of the Qasimi Shaikh and Deputy-Governor of the town. The unfortunate vessel, after being pillaged and wilfully damaged, was allowed to go, and made the best of her way to the Persian coast, where the owner found an' effective advocate in Commander Balfour; for that officer, after due enquiry through a subordinate and a short correspondence with Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, who merely ordered his son to afford redress, himself proceeded to Ras-al- Khaimah. Shaikh Ibrahim had recourse to subterfuges, but they were cut short by the entry of eleven armed boats into the harbour, which took six vessels belonging to the port in tow. In the result the compensation, amounting to $810, was disgorged within 48 hours, and subsequently an additional punitive fine of $500 was levied under the orders of the Bombay Government. In 1866 the Political Resident, Colonel Lewis Pelly, submitted for the 1866-68, information of Government a number of specimen cases illustrative of the petty irregularities which still frequently occurred in the Gulf. It appears that Colonel Pelly felt himself precluded under recent orders from resorting to coercive measures, or even to the imposition of fines, without the previous sanction of Government; and that the abolition of the Indian Navy, whose ships, always at the disposal of the Resident, had been replaced by those of the Royal Navy with more extensive duties to perform, had increased the difficulties of the Resident's position. The reply to this important reference, in which the Resident clearly implied that more freedom of action should be allowed him and a greater material force placed at his disposal, is unfortunately not traceable. From this time onwards the maintenance of the peace in Gulf waters seems to have become almost a matter of routine, and recourse to exceptional measures was seldom required. In September 1868, however, in connection with a great raid by the Shaikhs of Bahrain and 'Abu Dhabi upon the coast of Qatar, described in the history of Bahrain, Colonel Pelly found it necessary under the orders of Govern ment to proceed to Abu Dhabi with the ' Vigilant ', ' Sind ' and ' Hugh Rose ', and a satisfactory settlement was obtained, but not without actual preparations for a bombardment. The terms enforced included the surrender of a Mashuwah and two Arab mares and the payment, partly by instalments, of compensation to the amount of $25,000; but of this large sum, it would appear, only Rs. 3,740 was ever actually realised. The Shaikh was obliged by Colonel Pelly to give up his only three guns, which were however returned to him, as their removal might have exposed the town of Abu Dhabi to Bedouin attacks. Considerable alarm was caused in Trucial 'Oman by the Turkish expedition 1871. which annexed Hasa in 1871, for the avowed object of the Turks was the subjugation of ' Najd,' and it appeared that by ' Najd ' they understood all countries which had at any time paid tribute to the Wahhabi Amirs; the statement even appeared in an official journal at Baghdad that Sharjah, Dibai and Abu Dhabi were places in ' Najd.' The British Government, however, were ultimately successful, as related in the histories of Hasa and Bahrain, in inducing the Turks to confine their proceedings to Hasa and Qatar; and meanwhile, in June 1871, they instructed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to prevent the Trucial Shaikhs from taking part, on either side, in the struggle between the Turks and the Wahhabis. In 1876, in connection with an attempt by the people ol Shamailiyah to cast off the yoke of the Qawasim, the question of the despatch by sea by the Shaikh of Sharjah of reinforcements, military stores, etc., for his garrison at Dibah was formally raised. The Shaikh contended, not unreasonably, that such a proceeding on his part was not prohibited bv any of his engagements; but the Resident, Colonel E. C. Ross, recommended that all such acts should be forbidden by- Government on grounds of general policy, experience having shown that armed Arabs, when once afloat, invariably gave way to the temptation to indulge in indiscriminate plunder. In 1880 the Resident withheld permission from the Shaikh of Sharjah to attempt the recovery of Fujairah by sea, advising him instead to proceed by ' negotiations and wise arrangements '; and in the following year the 1876-81.''l 1878. 1882. 1884. 1885-1886. Slave trade, and further Ensagement (1856) re lating to the same. Telegraph Agreement, 1864. Absconding Debtors Agreement, 24th June, 1879. 58 Government of India ordered that the whole of the Qasimi coast on the Gulf of 'Oman from Dibah to Khor Kalba, as also the coast of Ruus-al-Jibal, so far as might be convenient, from Dibah to Musandam, ' should be deemed subject to the operation of the maritime truce,' which was not applicable to the coasts of the 'Oman Sultanate.* In 1878 Shaikh Hashar of Dibai, a man of quick and impetuous temper even for an Arab, refused to satisfy three claims established against his subjects, the plaintiffs in two cases being Persians and in the third an Indian; and Colonel Miles found it necessary to visit Dibai in H.M.S. ' Teazer.' Compensation and a fine were exacted and an offending boat was burned, after which the Shaikh apologised for his conduct and friendly relations were resumed. In June 1882 it was discovered that boats belonging to 'Ajman had been implicated in an attack, some time previously, on the ' Fath-al-Kanm,' a vessel under Turkish colours in the Red Sea, and that part of the booty had been landed at 'Ajman. H.M.S. ' Arab ' was accordingly sent to 'Ajman, where a quantity of the goods was recovered and nine of the boats implicated were publicly burnt as an example. In June 1884, a dispute about diving stations having taken place on the pearl banks between a boat of 'Ajman and another of Sharjah, Saif-al-Adham, a mischievous 'Omani who had been living on Sirri Island for several years since his expulsion from 'Oman, sided with the Sharjah boat and fired upon the other. In consequence of this offence H.M.S. ' Philomel ' was sent with the Residency Agent to Sirri, where Saif's own boat was publicly destroyed. In 1885 or 1886 the Shaikh of Bakhah moved by sea with an armed force, apparently to assist the Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah in some operations against Sha'am; he escaped with an admonition from the Resident. At the beginning of the period the slave trade continued almost unabated, especially at Sharjah, Umm-al-Qaiwain and 'Ajman. The Shaikhs professed them selves extremely willing, but quite unable, to suppress the traffic; it was ascertained however that the Shaikh of Sharjah, who was the most obsequious of all in his protestations, habitually levied a tax of $4 upon each newly imported slave. In 1856 a further Engagement was obtained from the Trucial Shaikhs, in which they undertook, among other things, to seize and deliver up to the British authorities any slaves whose importation into their territories should be proved. The Rutis-al-Jibal tract having been crossed at the isthmus of Maqlab by the Indo-European Telegraph Department's line and a station having been established on an island in Khor-ash-Sham, it was considered advisable, as the jurisdiction over the district was asserted by some of the inhabitants to belong to Sharjah, to obtain a written guarantee for the protection of the line ' in and near ' their territories from all the Trucial Shaikhs. An Agreement in this sense, in the form of an additional article of the Perpetual Treaty of Peace of 1853, was accordingly concluded in 1864. We have already adverted, in connection with the Ten Years' Maritime Truce, to a principal cause of such minor disturbances as still occurred at sea—the migration, namely, of debtors engaged in the pearl fishery or pearl trade from one jurisdiction to another with a view to evading their liabilities. The evil was a far-reaching one, and in 1868 Colonel Pelly, the British Political Resident, took steps for enforcing the duty of extradition upon harbouring chiefs; but they were not, apparently, efficacious. At length, on the 24th of June 1879, an agreement for the mutual surrender of fraudulently absconding debtors was accepted and sealed by the Trucial Shaikhs in the presence of Haji 'Abdur Rahman, the Residency Agent at Sharjah, and of Haji 'Abdul Qasim, Residency Munshi, who had been specially deputed from Bushehr to explain to the Shaikhs the views and wishes of the Resident; it provided that in future every runaway of the class in question should be at once surrendered; that, if on the contrary he were harboured, the harbouring chief should be liable to a fine of $50, or in the case of the absconder being allowed to proceed to the pearl banks to a fine of $100, besides incurring liability for the just debts of the runaway; that the facts, if disputed, should be settled by a Majlis or council of arbitration; and, finally, that no fine should be * Such was the form of the order, but it appears somewhat inappropriate. The General Treaty of Peace of 1820 and the Perpetual Treaty of Peace of 1853 do not apply to particular waters or coasts, but to the subjects of the signatories wherever they may be. It would have been sufficient, and more strictly correct, to have recognised Shamailiyah as belonging to Sharjah, as was actually done later in 1903. Nor can the inhabitants of Ruus-al-Jibal, who are Masqat subjects, be properly regarded as subject to the treaties quoted above, to which their Sultan is not a party.59 enforced without the approval of the British Resident. The Government of India were at first apprehensive lest the new system, by unduly increasing the power of the Shaikhs over their subjects, should lead to oppression; but Colonel Ross was able to assure them that, under the patriarchal form of government which prevailed, cases of genuine oppression were rare, and that the system was not likely to be abused. Experience has now fully demonstrated both the justness of this view and the beneficial tendency of the Agreement.* Relations of Trucial 'Oman with the Wahhabis, etc., 1853-92. The power of the Wahhabi agent in Trucial 'Oman, though his presence was not at once removed, had fallen to a low point; and, having no longer any material force at his command, he was reduced to maintaining his position by petty intrigues and by playing off one Shaikh against another. In 1854 Ahmad the Sadairi, who at this time was still the representative of the Wahhabi Government in Baraimi, was reported to be making a laudable use of his influence to restrain the Trucial Shaikhs from wanton aggressions on one another; and he had even, on the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi declining to hold himself responsible for the conduct of the Manasir, organised a successful expedition against that predatory tribe. In 1855 on the contrary, in a difficulty which occurred between a colony of Shihiih at Hamriyah and the Shaikh of Sharjah, the suzerain of that place, reason was found for suspecting that the Wahhabi agent had encouraged the rebellion with a view to the eventual creation of a pied a terre for himself upon the Truciai seaboard. In this project he was opposed by the Na'im of Baraimi, one of whose chiefs, Fadhil-bin-Muhammad, had an interview with Captain Kemball at the coast in 1855, and suggested that British influence should be brought to bear for the expulsion of the Wahhabis; but the Resident explained that the policy of Govern ment was now one of non-intervention in internal affairs, and himself merely continued to avoid, as his predecessors had done since 1840, direct communication with or recognition of the Wahhabi representative. From 1864 to 1866 the attention of Turki-bin-Ahmad the Sadairi, Wahhabi agent at Baraimi, was chiefly engaged by the affairs of the Oman Sultanate, on which he was trying to enforce payment of an increased tribute; but from this struggle, which is described in another place, the Trucial Shaikhs, including Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar who was now in his dotage and died in 1866, seem to have held themselves aloof. About this time Shaikh Khalid-bin-Sultan of Sharjah, who had thrown in his lot with the Wahhabis, ventured with their assistance to erect a fort on the coveted Zora site between 'Ajman and Hamriyah; but, as this innovation threatened to disturb the peace of the entire coast, the fort was bombarded and destroyed by H.M.S. 'Highflyer' in January ^^. on J^ e occurrence of a breach between the British Government and the Wahhabis. 1 he question of Zora remained in abeyance thereafter until 1895. In 1867, on the re-incorporation of Ras -al-Khaimah with the Shanah bnaiKn- dom, the intervention of the Wahhabis was sought, but without success, by Ibrahim, the displaced Shaikh of Ras -al-Khaimah. , , , In April 1869 the Wahhabi representative at Baraimi, having proceeded .o Sharjah, entangled himself in the domestic quarrels of the ruling family with the result that, in the general affray which look place, he was shot dead. A numoer of his followers were killed on the same occasion, and the others withdrew. wo months later the opportunity thus presented was taken advantage ot by Saiyid 'Azzan-bin-Qais of Masqat, as related in the history of the Oman Sultanate, to drive the Wahhabis once and for all out of Baraimi. j r • ^ Baraimi affairs, from the departure ol Wahhabis, are treated ot m e Annexure' 1 ' on the history of the Abu Dhabi principality, with which the Oasis, thouah independent, is very closely connected. . . In 1888 there were rumours, emanating from Qatar, of a contemplated invasion of Trucial 'Oman by Ibn-Rashid of Najd; but, as no invasion was attempted, . l seems probable that they may have been invented and disseminated by Jasim, tnt A1 Thani Shaikh of Dohah, for his own purposes.

The Shaikh of Sharjah, whom Shaikh Jasim attempted to draw into the affair and whom he pretended to consult with regard to the landing at Sharjah of stores for the Central Arabian forces, was advised by the British authorities to excuse himself from co-operation as best he could, and apparently did so; but a little later he figured as member of a Ghafiri combination of all the other Trucial Shaikhs against the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai. The Na'im of Baraimi from the first professed an intention of acting on the side of the Shammar Amir. Relations of Trucial 'Oman with the Sultanate of 'Oman, etc., 1853-1892. In the peaceful era which had now dawned there was no more actual warfare between the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman and the ruler of Masqat; and, so far as any connection was maintained between them, it depended chiefly on the internal affairs of the Sultanate, which are related elsewhere in the proper place. 1854. In 1854, hostilities having broken out at Bandar 'Abbas, in connection with the lease of that place, between the ruler of Masqat and the Persian Government, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Sa'id-bin-Tahnun, actually put to sea with a fleet to render assistance to Saiyid Sa'ld; but he was obliged to return to port by the British authorities on the ground that his action might widen the area of disturbance and produce a state of general insecurity at sea. 1857. The encroachments of Saiyid Turki of Sohar in 1857 on the possessions of his brother Saiyid Thuwaini in Batinah were attributed partly to the instigation of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar of Sharjah, to whom a stern warning against intrigue in that direction was accordingly conveyed by the Resident under the orders of Government. 1861. In 1861 a converse case occurred, through attempts by emissaries of Saiyid Thuwaini to arrange a combination with the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Umm-al- Qaiwain against the Qasimi Shaikh of Sharjah; but the chiefs addressed refused to entertain the suggestion, baited though it was with liberal promises, and no occasion for interference by the British authorities arose. 1867. Saiyid Turki of 'Oman, in the course of his endeavours in 1867 to recover his appanage of Sohar, had recourse once more to the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman; but those whose aid he sought, having been warned by the officers of the British Government against any disturbance of the peace, especially at sea, made no response to his overtures. 1869. After his capture of Baraimi from the Wahhabis in 1869, 'Azzan-bin-Qais formed an alliance with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom he also promised a subsidy for the defence of the frontier of the Sultanate upon that side. The alliance was directed against the other Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, all of whom Saiyid 'Azzan then regarded as favouring the Wahhabi cause; but not long afterwards the Shaikh of Sharjah also associated himself with the allies, and the danger from the Wahhabis came to an end. 1870. In May 1870 Saiyid Turki of 'Oman paid a visit to Dibai with a view to enlisting the support of the Trucial Shaikhs in his struggle with the usurper 'Azzan- bin-Qais; but the influence of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who adhered loyally to his understanding with 'Azzan, was sufficient to prevent for a time any overt movement in lavour of the princely wanderer. In the following October, however, in the battle of Dhank which virtually gave to him the Sultanate of 'Oman, Saiyid Turki received invaluable aid, in the shape of contingents, from the Shaikhs of Dibai, 'Ajman and Ras-al-Khaimah and from the Na'im and Bani Qitab tribes. 1871-1891. In the following year the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi visited Saiyid Turki, notwith standing the previous opposition between their views, and was received with every honour; but in January 1886 he was suspected of a design to raid the Batinah District in concert with the rebels of Sharqlyah, and in May 1887 Saiyid Turki was guilty of an unfriendly act in lending support to the Dhawahir of Baraimi, who were at war with the Bani Yas. In 1891 Shaikh Zaid made another journey to Masqat, apparently in connection with Baraimi affairs.61 Relations of Tmcial 'Oman with Qatar, 1853-92. For about 9 years from 1881 to 1890, almost continual warfare prevailed by land between Zaid-bin-Khalifah, Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and Jasim-bin- Dhabi Muhammad, the Al Thani Shaikh of Qatar. For this state of matters a claim an( ^ ^1 which the Al Thani Shaikh maintained to possession of Khor-al-'Odaid in Abu Thani Shaikh Dhabi territory was partly responsible; but the scene of action was at all times of so remote from the more populous part of Trucial 'Oman, that we have preferred 1881 - 1890 - to treat of the operations in connection with Qatar affairs rather than in the history of Trucial 'Oman. The scare of an invasion from Central Arabia in 1888, already mentioned, was perhaps only a stratagem by which Shaikh Jasim sought to bring about an alliance of the other Trucial Shaikhs against his enemy Zaid. Relations of Trucial 'Oman with the Turkish Government, 1853-92. 'Odaid affairs, described at length in the separate history of the Abu Dhabi principality, gave opportunities for interference in Trucial 'Oman of which the Turks did not neglect to avail themselves. In 1874 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi complained that the local Turkish officials in Qatar had written to him on the subject of 'Odaid, denying his authority there; in 1875 the Turkish flag was apparently sometimes flown at 'Odaid; and there is no doubt that a small tribute to Turkey was paid by the 'Odaid colonists between 1873 and 1876. In 1878 the Porte claimed 'Odaid as a Turkish possession and protested against operations for the repression of piracy which had been undertaken there by the British authorities a few months before. Finally, in 1889, the Wali of Basrah addressed the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, urging him to submit his differences with the Shaikh of Dohah in Qatar to Turkish arbitration; but the suggestion was declined under British advice. Relations of Trucial 'Oman with Persia, 1853-92. In 1855, Khallfah-bin-Sa'id, the Qasimi Shaikh of Lingeh, being then a minor and his affairs having fallen into some disorder. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar oi Sharjah, who was his kinsman, assumed virtual charge of Lingeh and continued for some months to reside there. Internal history of Trucial 'Oman, 1853-1892. Political combinations without permanence, and an endless succession of petty Ear ij er wars by land, compose almost the whole internal history of Trucial Oman during events, this period. Of these meaningless occurrences down to the year 1870 only two need be signalised. At the end of 1857 an attack was made by the Shaikh of Abu Hail, a dependent of the Shaikh of Sharjah, on an encampment of the Mazari' tribe at Kawanij and resulted in the death of four Mazari', one of whom was a Shaikh; the Abu Hail force, 150 strong, regained their homes the same night with a quantity of booty including two horses and 30 camels. As the Shaikh of Sharjah declined to make restitution to the Mazari', the Shaikh of Dibai, under whose protection the Mazari' were, obtained the help of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi against him; and in March it was announced that Sharjah had been defeated. A reconciliation of the parties was then effected by the Residency Agent at Sharjah. A campaign by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi against the Shaikh of Sharjah 1868. in April 1868 was rendered memorable by an unusual incident, for Zaid-bin- Khalifah, advancing in front of his troops, challenged his enemy, Khalid-bin- Sultan, to meet him in single combat. The proposal having been accepted, the challenger inflicted on his antagonist a wound which quickly proved mortal. In 1869 the town of Ras-al-Khaimah and its dependencies became a separate Separation of Shaikhdom under Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah, a nephew of the ruling Shaikh of R as-al-Khai- Sharjah, and so continued until his death in 1900. SharjahTseQ. 4853362 Later events. From 1871 onwards, in consequence of the institution of Administration Reports, information regarding the dissensions of the Trucial Shaikhs is abundant; and, notwithstanding the extreme unimportance of most of the events, it seems advisable, on account of their recentness and of results which in some cases still continue, to present them to the reader in a condensed form. 1871-72. In 1871 or 1872 the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, between whom and the Shaikh of Sharjah there was a dispute in regard to Bu Musa, put to sea with the intention of raiding the horses of his enemy from that island; but he was anticipated by boats from Sharjah which arrived there first. The Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai were at this time at daggers drawn, in consequence of the protection afforded by each chief to runaway debtors from the jurisdiction of the other. 1872-73. During 1872 or 1873 war was begun, or continued, between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Umm-al-Qaiwain, the Shaikh of 'Ajman eventually coming to the assistance of the former and the headman of Harnriyah, a disloyal subject of Sharjah, to that of the latter. 1873-74. i n I873 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi joined the combination against the Shaikh of Sharjah, who was generally unpopular on account of his faithlessness, and made a raid by night upon Sharjah town. Eventually the Shaikh of Sharjah was defeated with a loss of 50 men. 1874 - In 1874 the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah joined the Shaikh of Sharjah, while the Shaikh of Dibai enrolled himself in the opposite faction and the headman of Hamrlyah apparently withdrew from the affair. The friendly offices of the British Residency Agent were exercised without avail to promote a reconciliation. 1875. An expedition by land from Dibai, 200 strong, now attacked the environs of Ras-al-Khaimah, killing 7 men, and returned home. Soon afterwards, in February 1895, the headman of Hamrlyah effected a reconciliation between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Umm-al-Qaiwain; but the war between Sharjah and Dibai continued; and in May an attack on Dibai town was made by the people of 'Ajman and Sharjah, reinforced by Bedouins of the Na'Im tribe. About July a raid was made on Hamnyah by 200 camel-riders from Abu Dhabi, who next, with the assistance of a Dibai force, ravaged the gardens of Fasht and Sharjah. At length in September peace was made between Sharjah and Dibai. 1876 - In 1876 the country appears to have been quiescent after the exceptional disturbances of the previous year. 1877-78. | n j u iy 1^77 the 'Awamir Bedouins fell upon the town of Dibai, killing two men and wounding 10; but they were repulsed with a loss to themselves of 40 killed and eight captured: in October, assisted by the Daru', they again plundered a Dibai settlement. Between August 1877 and February 1878 numerous raids were made by Bani Qitab Bedouins, chiefly in Abu Dhabi territory; but subjects of Sharjah and Dibai were not exempt from molestation, and the Ghafalah apparently countenanced the doings of the Bani Qitab. In February 1878 both townsmen and nomads became weary of the strife and a general peace was arranged. The town of Dibai had now become the principal port on the coast and was larger than Abu Dhabi, which appeared to be declining. 1879 ' At the close of 1879 the Na'im of the Baraimi neighbourhood were divided amongst themselves, and the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ajman each espoused the cause of a different faction; the result was tension upon the coast also, where the Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qaiwain associated themselves with 'Ajman and a counter-alliance was formed between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. No actual hostilities, however, took place among these chiefs; and in December the Shaikh of 'Ajman, who had gone to Baraimi, returned to his home after witnessing the success of his proteges amongst the Na'im. 1880-81. During the years 1880 and 1881 general tranquility prevailed. In 1882 a quarrel, arising out of family relationships, came to a head between the Shaikhs of Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ras-al-Khaimah and ended in open warfare; the principal cause was a marriage contracted by Ahmad-bin-'Abdullah of Umm- al-Qaiwain with a sister of Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah of Ras-al-Khaimah, subject to a stipulation that the lady should continue to reside at Ras-al-Khaimah and that her husband should spend a part of each year with her there. A divorce was declared by the Shaikh of 'Ajman, who went to Ras-al-Khaimah for the purpose as agent of the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain; but it did not end the dispute; and wrangling continued on the subject of property. Ahmad-bin-'Abdullah, who was of a more turbulent disposition than his adversary, then allowed seven boats from his port to proceed to Rams for the purpose of provoking a quarrel, which they did most effectually by assaulting the crew of a Ras-al-Khaimah fishing boat;63 these proceedings, however, verged upon a breach of the maritime peace, and the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain was accordingly reprimanded by the British Political Resident and compelled to pay a fine. Fighting on land ensued, in which the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain was assisted by the Shaikh of 'Ajman and the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah by his own brother, the Shaikh of Sharjah, and by a part of the Na'im tribe. At length, in January 1883, a reconciliation between the parties was arranged by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, on the condition that all injuries should be mutually condoned. The Shaikh of Dibai was at this time on good terms with the Shaikhs of both Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. The years 1883 and 1884 were uneventful. The chief of Abu Dhabi was now 1883-84. regarded as the most powerful among the Trucial Shaikhs, the hegemony having been lost by Sharjah chiefly through the incompetence of its ruler, Saqar-bin- Khalid, who succeeded to the Shaikhship in 1883. Presents were exchanged between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of 'Oman, and between the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain and the Sultan of Zanzibar; but they had apparently no political significance, at least of a local character. As usual in Trucial 'Oman, after a short interval of peace there was a sudden 1885. renewal of disturbances. In May 1885 the son of Ahmad-bin-'Abdullah, Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, quarrelled with his father and took refuge with Rashid-bin- Hamaid, Shaikh of 'Ajman, who refused to give him up; and the Shaikh of Sharjah, Saqar-bin-Khalid, joined the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain for the purpose of attacking 'Ajman. Shortly after this the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain sent to sea two Baqarahs carrying 50 men, as also some munitions of war which were landed partly at Hairah and partly at Sharjah,—an act for which it was necessary to call him to account. In November, Mr. Robertson, on behalf of the Resident, visited Umm-al-Qaiwain in H.M.S. ' Reindeer ', but Ahmad-bin-'Abdullah evaded a meeting; subsequently, however, his conduct seems to have been condoned on his undertaking not to repeat the offence. Meanwhile raids were committed by the inhabitants of Umm-al-Qaiwain and Hamrlyah upon one another; they were suspended, but only for the brief space, after a reconciliation effected in August by the Residency Agent at Sharjah. At the end of November the Shaikh of Dibai united with the Shaikh of 'Ajman and began to foray the Shaikh of Sharjah's territories. On the 20th of January 1886 the Shaikhs of Dibai, 'Ajman and Hamrlyah 1886. attacked the town of Sharjah with a force of about 1,000 men and a field-piece, and a battle followed in which the people of Sharjah lost 40 men killed and 25 wounded, while the attacking force had only five fatal casualties. At the request of Shaikh Saqar-bin-Khalid of Sharjah the British Residency Agent, who had in the meanwhile informed the Shaikh of Dibai that he would be held responsible for any loss suffered by British subjects in Sharjah, intervened between the parties and succeeded in arranging a peace upon condition that the Shaikh of Sharjah should renounce his alliance with the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. After the retirement of Sharjah from the conflict the campaign was continued by Dibai, 'Ajman and Hamrlyah against Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ras-al-Khaimah; but the operations were now confined to petty raids, some of which were committed on dependencies of Ras-al-Khaimah, at the instigation of Dibai, by the people of Bakhah and Kumzar and by the Shihuh tribe generally. In April an attempt at mediation on the part of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was foiled by the obstinacy of the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. In May a raid was made on Umm-al-Qaiwain by the people of Hamrlyah, and shortly afterwards, in the absence of the men of Hamrlyah at the pearl banks, a force from Umm-al-Qaiwain entered and destroyed that place, killing several persons and carrying off with them 25 slaves besides other booty: the headman of Hamriyah, however, defended himself in his fort and escaped capture. To avenge this injury to his ally, the Shaikh of Dibai mustered a force of 35 horsemen and 400 camel-riders and marched against Umm-al-Qaiwain; but the excesses of the headman of Hamrlyah so displeased him that he soon returned home. In September a dispute about divers arose between Sharjah and 'Ajman, which, had the Residency Agent not mediated, would probably have led to a renewal of hostilities between those two. In 1887 several robberies were committed bv Bedouin Manaslr on boats 1887 ' anchored in creeks to the north of Abu Dhabi town, subjects of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah being among the sufferers. As the robbers had swum off from the land these cases could not be treated as infractions of the maritime peace; and, as it did not appear that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi could fairly be held responsible for the misdeeds of a lawless and wandering tribe, the British authorities64 did not do more than appeal to his honour and sense of justice. In September a band of Manasir marauders made a successful raid so far to the north as Sharjah, from which place they carried off eight women and children and several camels and horses. 1888-89. In 1888 a feud prevailed between the people of Ras-al-Khaimah and the Shihiih tribe; several townsmen were murdered in outlying date plantations; and 200 palms were destroyed by Bedouins at the village of Khatt in Jiri. A coalition, as already mentioned above in connection with Wahhabi affairs, took place in 1888 between the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai, whom the supposed Wahhabi danger had found bitterly at variance, and about the same time the Shaikh of Dibai effected a reconciliation between the Shaikh of Sharjah on the one hand and the Shaikh of Ajman and the headman of Hamriyah on the other; his object appears to have been to set the people of 'Ajman Hamriyah at liberty to assist Dibai in case that principality should be called upon to withstand a Wahhabi attack. The coalition, however, between the Hinawi Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai soon provoked a counter-alliance between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah; and the Shaikhs of Umm-al-Qaiwain and 'Ajman, after endeavouring for a time to hold aloof, threw in their lot with the northern combination, which thus became a federation of all the Ghafiris. 1890. In February 1890 active trouble broke out between the principalities of Sharjah and Dibai, in consequence of redress being refused for the mutilation of some Dibai camels within Sharjah limits; friction had really begun in the summer of 1889, when some raids were committed on Sharjah by Manasir Bedouins nominally subject to the influence of Dibai and Abu Dhabi. A temporary under standing was patched up by the British Residency Agent; but in March 1890 a fresh rupture took place, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi moved a force in the direction of Dibai to support his ally. A considerable amount of petty mischief was done on both sides, after which negotiations for a general peace took place, apparently at the instance of the Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al- Qaiwain; but they were inconclusive. A raid was made on Ras-al-Khaimah by hostile Shihuh and was repelled with a loss to the raiders of 11 men killed. The punishment of a raiding gang of 'Awamir and Na'im by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi led to threats against Abu Dhabi by the Na'im, but they were not fulfilled. 1891. The year 1891 passed quietly, in consequence partly of the balance of power established by the Hinawi and Ghafiri combinations of 1889, which still endured, and partly of the good offices of the British Residency Agent in averting collisions between Sharjah and Dibai. Certain differences occurred between the Shaikhs of Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ras-al-Khaimah, but they were adjusted by the Shaikh of Sharjah. The most important event of the year was probably the migration en bloc of about 400 men of the Marar tribe from Dibai, where they considered themselves ill-treated by the Shaikh, to Sharjah; the move was effected at the end of the pearl season by simply returning from the banks to Sharjah instead of Dibai. This affair gave rise to a number of pecuniary claims and counterclaims of which the settlement, notwithstanding the constant mediation of the British Residency Agent, was attended by fighting on land and dragged on for nearly three years. Exclusive Agreement of the Trucial Shaikhs with Great Britain, March 1892. In order to understand the genesis of an important Agreement by which the position ot the 1 rucial Shaikhs with relerence to the British Government was in 1892 further defined, it is necessary to go back a few years and refer to certain events by which the undisputed predominance of British influence in Trucial 'Oman seemed to be threatened. These events indicated the entrance into Persian Gulf affairs ol new iorces which were shortly to bring about a general challenge of the British position in the whole region of the Gulf. An absurd but apparently serious attempt was made by Persian officials in 1887—88 to establish a footing in Trucial Oman, the principal agent employed being Sartip Haji Ahmad Khan, a former Deputy-Governor of Bushehr. ^ In August 1887 this individual left for the coast of Trucial 'Oman on the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company s steamer '■ Calder ',—a proceeding so extraordinary on his part, with reference to the season of the year and to other circumstances, that the British Resident at Bushehr, Colonel E. C. Ross, caused Persian in trigues with the Trucial Shaikhs. 1887-88.X 65 him to be followed by the Residency steamer ' Lawrence ' to Abu Dhabi, where he landed in full uniform. After spending some days with the Shaikh at Abu Dhabi the Sartip paid a visit to Dibai; and then, returning to Abu Dhabi, he took his departure for Lingeh in a native sailing vessel. The Trucial Shaikhs, who had pledged themselves to reticence towards the British authorities, at first preserved an impenetrable silence regarding the designs of Ahmad Khan; but at length, the Shaikh of Dibai having been persuaded 'to unbosom himself to the Sultan of 'Oman, it transpired that the Sartip had proposed the establishment of close relations between the Shaikhs and the Persian Government with a view to the exclusion of British influence from Trucial 'Oman. In January 1888 Ahmad Khan, apparently believing the way to be now sufficiently prepared, returned from Bushehr to the Trucial Coast in a native vessel. He brought with him a number of Persian flags, presumably for distribution, and, being a man of method, would have commenced operations in the neighbourhood of Ras Musandam; but the inhabitants of that tract refused to let him land. Later, accompanied by the Shaikh of Qishm and a number of armed men, he had an interview with the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain; but soon after this, the impracticability of his scheme having quickly become apparent, he again withdrew to Persia. The Persian Government, on a complaint being made at Tehran by the British Legation, repudiated the Sartip's action and even volunteered to reprimand him; and, though they subsequently presented him with a sword of honour, their official disavowal, being communicated through the Commander of H.M.S. ' Osprey ' to the Trucial Shaikhs, assuaged the not inconsiderable excitement to which the proceedings of Ahmad Khan had given rise along the coast. In December 1887, between the first and the second visit of the Sartip to the Trucial Coast, a precaution had been taken by Colonel Ross which no doubt contributed materially to the final discomfiture of the Persian emissary; it consisted in obtaining from the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Ras-al-Khaimah, 'Ajman, Umm-al- Qaiwain, Sharjah and Dibai a written assurance on the part of each that he would on no account correspond or enter into an agreement with any Government whatever except the British, and that he would not, without the assent of the British Government, allow an agent of any other Government to reside in his dominions. These undertakings were forwarded by the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India. During a number of years, as elsewhere related, the Turkish Government showed considerable interest in the dispute between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the Qubaisat rebels against his authority who had settled at Khor-al-'Odaid in the vicinity of Qatar; and, subsequently, the protracted war between the Abu Dhabi Shaikh and the A1 Thani Shaikh of Qatar provided the Turks with an excuse for a correspondence with the former, in which they pretended to exercise authority over him. But the principal reason for attaching the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman to the British Government by new and more stringent obligations was the appearance of two Frenchmen upon the Trucial Coast, whose object was suspected to be political intrigue; for a forward movement on the part of the French Government had, by the simple expedient of distributing French flags, lately been begun in 'Oman. Of the two suspicious individuals one was named Tramier or Thorny, while the other was a M. Chapuy, ' half adventurer, half merchant and wholly intriguer', who two years later came to notice again through his proceedings at Siir in the 'Oman Sultanate. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, who was three times visited by the associates and received presents from them, fell to some extent under their influence; he was easily convinced of the advantages of the French flag, which now enabled more than a dozen vessels belonging to Stir to engage in the slave trade without fear of molestation by British cruisers; and he even offered to write a letter to the French Government, promising a good reception in his country to citizens of the French Republic. In view of the mischievous activity of MM. Chapuy and Framier, who were at length reported to have obtained the grant of a site at Umm-al-Qaiwain, Major A. Talbot, the British Political Resident in the Gulf, suggested the conclusion of a formal Agreement on the lines of the written assurances of December 1887; and, his proposals having been approved by the Government ol India, an Exclusive Agreement was signed on various dates in March 1892 by the Trucial Shaikhs at this time six in number through the existence of a separate Shaikhdom of Ras-al-Khaimah—and by the Shaikh of Bahrain. Under this Agreement the Shaikhs bound themselves, their heirs, and their successors (1) on no account to Preliminary exclusive assurances, 1887. Turkish intrigues.

These engagements were ratified by the Viceroy of India on the 12th of May following, and were subsequently approved by Her Majesty's Government. ¥ The difficulties which had arisen did not disappear immediately on the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement, for the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dibai at first pretended to think that the return to them of ratified copies meant that the Agreement had not been confirmed, and the Shaikh of Dibai, annoyed at British interference with the slave trade, was reported to have proposed ' taking the French flag and so escaping from the malice of the English ^ By degrees, however, the results of the supposed French agents' visits were effaced. PERIOD SINCE THE EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT British relations with Trucial 'Onianj 1892—1907. General features of the period. Observance of the Treaties of 1820 and 1853. 1892. Injuries to persons under British protection. The closeness of the relations existing between Great Britain and Trucial 'Oman increased greatly after the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement in 1892. British influence began to permeate the country; and, as will be apparent from facts related further on, the preferential rights of Great Britain in Trucial Oman became a factor of importance in questions arising between the Shaikhs and external powers. The Agreements of the Shaikhs for the maintenance of peace at sea were observed with great exactitude. Even trivial breaches ot these became almost unknown, and no difficulties of any sort arose, except from a minor question of the use of the Trucial flag. _ . In March 1892 some Dibai subjects crossed over to the island ot Sir Bu Na air, a possession of the Shaikh of Sharjah, and disarmed and ejected from one of the fishing grounds some natives of Sirri Island, who were then, on account of the connection of Sirri with Lingeh, regarded as Qasimi dependents; in accordance with the orders of the British Resident, however, the aggressors were required to withdraw and to return the arms seized; and the Shaikh of Dibai undertook that in future his subjects should not resort to Sir Bu Na'air without express permission from the Shaikh of Sharjah. In September ot the same year the Shaikh of Dibai despatched an armed boat to the assistance of the Shaikh of 'Ajman, who was then threatened with a land attack by the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Umm- al-Qaiwain; but on account of this lawless proceeding he was condemned to pay a fine, and it was realised in the following November at a visit of the Resident to the coast. . No maritime irregularity deserving of mention was committed after this by the inhabitants of Trucial 'Oman; but in 1893 a Shihhi Shaikh ol Khasab in Ruus -al-Jibal, having put to sea with an armed party, attempted to enforce a claim upon the property of his deceased father-in-law at Sha'am. In consequence of this misdemeanour the Sultan of 'Oman, acting on British advice, summoned the Shaikh to Masqat, where after much delay he appeared and was mulcted in the sum of Rs. 50. Cases in which it was necessary to demand redress on behalf of persons enjoying British protection were, similarly, few and insignificant. In 1904, a Hindu having died at Abu Dhabi, Shaikh Saqar, who was in charge of the town in the absence of his father Shaikh Zaid, extorted $100 in return for permission to dispose of the body according to Hindu rites; but the money was afterwards refunded on a requisition by the Resident. In November of the same year a Hindu was robbed on Dalmah island, in the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, of a considerable sum in money and pearls; and again the unsatisfactory attitude of the Shaikh necessitated a remonstrance by the British political authority. * Annexure No. 8 to this chapter gives the text of the Exclusive Agreement.67 X 1 In 1900 Shaikh Abdul Aziz, on his accession not without violence to the Shaikhship of 'Ajman, wrote to the British Resident at Bushehr that he had signed the agreements of his predecessors with the British Government and that he would abide by them; and the Resident in reply expressed approval of the Shaikh's resolution. The incident was of a novel character and susgested that agreements by predecessors were not regarded as binding by the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, unless confirmed by themselves; but an enquiry held by Colonel Kemball showed that such was not the case, and the Government of India then laid it down that the various engagements executed by individual Trucial Shaikhs are necessarily binding on their successors. At the same time the Government of India emphasized the desirability of taking means to secure that each chief should be clearly acquainted with the provisions of the agreements by which he is bound. An Agreement for the suppression of the arms trade in their territories was signed by all the Trucial Shaikhs in 1902. As among the expedients by which the British Government were at this time endeavouring to combat the growth of the traffic in the Gulf, this Agreement is mentioned in the special Appendix on the Arms Trade, where also the text of the same is given as an Annexure. The wreck at Dibai in the autumn of 1903 of the ' Fath-al-Khair ', a native vessel owned at Suwaiq in the Sultanate of 'Oman, but flying the French flag and therefore regarded by the French Vice-Consul at Masqat'as under his protection, led to an exchange of views between the British and the French Governments in regard to the political status of Trucial 'Oman. In consequence of allegations that the boat in question had been plundered, the French Vice-Consul addressed a demand for compensation direct to the Shaikh of Dibai; and the despatch of the French cruiser ' Infernet' to Dibai to enforce compliance with the same was momentarily expected. At this juncture the Government of India authorised the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform the French Vice-Consul of the existence of the Exclusive Agreement and to offer to relieve him of the case; and at their suggestion a similar communication was made in Europe to the French Government. In April 1904 the French Government, after explaining that they had hitherto been unaware of the existence of the special relations between the British Government and the Trucial Shaikhs, agreed that the settlement of the case should be entrusted to British authorities, which was accordingly done. Eventually some compensation was awarded by a Shara' court at Dibai to the owner of the ' Fath-al-Khair', which was proved to have foundered in consequence of a collision. In 1906, with the object of ensuring that the Trucial Shaikhs should be properly acquainted with their treaty obligations, each was supplied with a collection, clearly printed in Arabic and in English and handsomely bound, of the principal agree ments in force between himself and the British Government. To this collection was prefixed, as an introduction, an address delivered by His Excellency Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, to the Trucial Shaikhs at a Darbar held off Sharjah on the 21st of November 1903.* Arrangements were also made to provide the chiefs from time to time with flags of the pattern prescribed in the Treaty of 1820, in adherence to which they had shown themselves remiss, some through indolence and apathy, others from prejudice. Avoidance of the use of the Trucial flag was most marked at Abu Dhabi and Dibai; and in 1906 the Hinawi Shaikhs of those places after mutual consultation informed the Resident, in reply to a communication on the subject, that they could not compel their subjects to place themselves under an emblem so closely identified wth Qasimi traditions and Ghafiri principles. For various reasons it was considered expedient not to press the matter at the time. Apart altogether from the question of specific engagements and their results, the period now under consideration was on the whole an auspicious one in the history of British relations with Trucial 'Oman. For three years, ending in 1899, no Resident visited Trucial 'Oman in person; but, in the years following, numerous tours along the coast were made by Colonel M. J. Meade, Colonel C. A. Kemball and Major P. Z. Cox, the successive Residents, and the foundations of a more regular and direct intercourse were laid. In these circumstances it became possible for British officers to pay occasional visits to the interior; and Major Cox, who, under the auspices of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, had travelled by way of Baraimi from Abu Dhabi to Masqat in 1902, was able in 1905 to explore the unknown country between Ras-al-Khaimah and Baraimi and to return to the coast at Sohar. * Vide the Appendix on Lord Curzon's Cruise page 2638. 48533 L Question of the necessity of renewal of agree ments, 1900.

General relations.68 In 1902, the idea of a formal British protectorate over Trucial 'Oman having been mooted, a close examination was made of the existing system, which was in the end declared to be perfectly satisfactory. It was reported by Colonel Kemball, in this connection, that new chiefs on their succession now generally sought to be recognised by the British Government, and that his advice, though not authoritatively given, was generally obeyed and even welcomed in internal affairs. In the same year the general attitude of the Shaikhs towards the British power was shown by their observance of the 26th of June as a public holiday in honour of the Coronation of King Edward; and the visit of Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, to the Trucial Coast, where, as elsewhere described, he held a Darbar at sea off Sharjah on the 21st of November 1903, was a further proof of the confidence and harmony that had come to prevail. At the same time it should be understood that the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman were still unpro- gressive, ignorant, and prone to childish suspicions. The failure of the Hinawi Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai to enforce on their subjects the use of the Trucial flag has already been mentioned; and other symptoms of a like nature appeared, in 1906, in the unwillingness of the Shaikhs to supply the Resident with genealogical tables of their families, in the reluctance of the Shaikh of Dibai to agree to the establishment of a British Indian post office at his capital, and in objections made by the Shaikh of Sharjah against the hoisting of a British Hag over the British Agency at Sharjah. Commercial a remarkable development of commerce, within the narrow limits imposed relations. by poverty of natural resources and sparseness of population, characterised the period between 1892 and 1907 in Trucial 'Oman; it was accelerated after 1902 by the decline of the Persian port of Lingeh. Before 1902 not more than four or five steamers had called at Dibai annually; but in the year mentioned no less than 21 steam vessels, mostly belonging to the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, entered the port; and early in 1904 the British India Steam Navigation Company included Dibai in their regular time-table. In 1902 the question of urging the Trucial Shaikhs to limit the rate of customs duty leviable by themselves to 5 per cent, ad valorem was discussed; but, as the rates actually in force were found to be everywhere lower than 5 per cent., it was decided to postpone action. A little later, however, a lessee of the export duty on mother-of-pearl shells at Dibai was found to be collecting the tax at a rate higher than 5 per cent., and a reference was made to the Shaikh, who at once promised to reduce it. Relations of Trucial 'Oman with Persia, 1892-1907. Difficulties arising from the Perso- Arab crisis at Lineeh. 1899-1900. In 1899 a question arose between the Government of Persia and the Shaikhs ol Irucial 'Oman through the expulsion by the Persians of the hereditary Arab Shaikh ot Lingeh, and later the meddlesome activity of the recently instituted Imperial Persian Customs occasioned trouble; in both cases the task of controlling the Arabs and of representing Arab interests devolved on the British power. In October 1899 the Persian Government, alarmed by a report that the expelled Shaikh of Lingeh and his supporters had found an asylum in Trucial 'Oman, appealed to the British Government to prevent their collecting a force for the recovery of Lingeh; and suitable warnings were accordingly addressed to the Trucial Shaikhs by the British authorities. Again in January 1900 the Persian Government complained that Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, the ex-Shaikh of Lingeh, was harboured by the Shaikh of Ras-al Khaimah; they asked that the British Government should prevent a descent by him upon Lingeh, which was appre hended; and they added a mighty threat that they would take action themselves against the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah,—a proceeding which, as was reported by the Resident, might easily result in the loss of their only vessel, the ' Persepolis '. A second warning was consequently sent to the Ras-al-Khaimah chief by H.M.S. ' Melpomene '; but it was ascertained at her visit to the port that, though Shaikh Muhammad was living there, no design of attacking Lingeh really existed. (The claims ol Qawasim and others on account of property destroyed or appropriated by the Persians in the Lingeh affair are dealt with in the history of the Persian Coast and Islands.)69 Early in 1900 it was discovered that a friendly correspondence was in progress Intrigue of between the Shaikh ol Abu Dhabi and the Darya-Baigi, the Persian Governor of t ^ e Governor the Gulf Ports; the matter was brought to the notice of the Residency Agent in of the Persian Trucial Oman by the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dibai, in whose minds the intrigue the^ 8 evidently excited apprehension. The object of the Darya Baiga was probably to Shaikh of detach Shaikh Zaid from the rest ol the I rucial Shaikhs for the purpose of Abu Dhabi, preventing an Arab attack upon Lingeh, a contingency of which the Persian officials 1900 - 01 - still lived in dread; and the Abu Dhabi Shaikh, on his part, had probably no deeper motive than to obtain favourable consideration of claims by some of his subjects to property in Persia and good treatment for his vessels upon the Persian Coast. Local rumour, however, connected the affair with the efforts of Russia to obtain a toothold in the Gulf, and in any case it was impossible to ignore so flagrant a violation by a Trucial Shaikh ol his Exclusive Agreement with the British Government. When the negotiations were detected the Shaikh had already sent two horses as a present to Lingeh, had differentiated himself from his neighbours by the adoption of a green flag in place of that prescribed by the Treaty of 1820, and had received a sword ol honour from the Shah of Persia along with a commen datory epistle, bearing the royal seal, which was publicly read in an assembly at Abu Dhabi. A remonstrance however sufficed; the direct dealings of the Shaikh with Persian officials instantly ceased; and the use of the new flag was also, but not so immediately, discontinued. In February 1901 a Dibai boat, which, in returning from Sohar, had been Principle obliged by stress of weather to take shelter at Hanjam, was seized for technical affirmed of reasons by the Persian Imperial Customs. The boat and its general cargo were [ he re P r jr sen - soon released in virtue of representations made by the British Political Resident; Trucial 0 16 but restoration of seven rifles and 900 cartridges found on board, the personal Shaikhs property of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, was only obtained in 1903 through the British abroad by Minister of Tehran. By this case, which the Government of India regarded as a the British test of the right of Great Britain to act on behalf of the Trucial Shaikhs in external affairs, the British Legation in Persia were made aware for the first time of the existence of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892; and the right in question, subse quently admitted, as we have seen, by France, may be considered to have been definitely assumed upon this occasion. The next question to arise between Trucial 'Oman and Persia was one of Attempted importance, for it involved, to some extent, the naval position of Great Britain annexation in the Persian Gulf. The establishment of control over Lingeh by the Persian Imperial Customs had, in 1902, driven much of the trade of that place away to anc i xunb the opposite side of the Gulf, especially to Dibai; and thereafter, with a view to by Persia, the creation on Bu Musa of a trade emporium untrammelled by Persian official 1904. interference, some merchants of Lingeh began to suggest that the island should be made a port of call by the British steamship companies. Bu Musa had formerly been ruled by the hereditary Arab governors of Lingeh in the capacity of Qasimi Shaikhs, not of Persian Officials, and after the abolition of the Arab governorship of Lingeh, the title of the Shaikh of Sharjah to possession of the island was indubitable. Nevertheless it was feared that actual and prospective loss of trade, if not further-reaching political considerations, might tempt the Persian Govern ment to some act of annexation; and the attention of the Government of India was drawn in this connection not only to the island of Bu Musa, but also to that of Tunb, of which the status was precisely similar. In the result the Shaikh of Sharjah was advised to hoist his flag on both islands, and in the summer of 1903 he did so. The sequel proved the precaution to have been necessary. At the end of March or the beginning of April 1904 the Persian Customs steamer ' Muzaffari,' carrying M. Dambrain, the European Director of Persian Customs at Bushehr, visited Tunb and Bu Musa; the Sharjah flags were lowered; the Sharjah flagstaff's were dismantled; and two Persians were placed on each of the islands as Customs guards. It subsequently appeared that these high-handed proceedings, though carried out by a Customs officer, had been initiated by the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, most probably under Russian advice; in the case of Bu Musa, the Minister, who evidently perceived the international bearings of the enterprise, had shown marked hesitation in giving the order to occupy. Serious representations were at once made in the proper quarter by the British Minister at Tehran, and in the end the Customs guards were withdrawn and the Persian flags, which had been hoisted, were removed by order of the Persian Government; this was done on the 14th of June 1904, and a few days later the Trucial flag was replaced on both islands to the general satisfaction 4853370 of the inhabitants of the Trucial Coast. The Persian Government, in consenting to remove the evidences of their usurpation, had stipulated that the ownership of the islands should be discussed at leisure between themselves and the British Government; but as mentioned in the history of the Persian Coast they failed to convince the British Government of the existence of Persian rights; indeed they did not seriously attempt to do so. Here it only remains to add that the Persians subsequently complained of the erection by the Shaikh of Sharjah of new buildings on Tunb, but that the complaint—in itself inadmissible as maintenance of the status quo formed no part of the mutual understanding—was proved by local investigation, and by the visits of British officers to Tunb in 1904 and 1905, to be groundless. Relations of Trucial 'Oman with the Wahhabi power, 1892-1907. Designs of Ibn-Sa'ud on Trucial 'Oman. 1905. Behaviour of the Trucial Shaikhs. Attitude of the British Government. Correspondence between Trucial 'Oman and Central Arabia had not at any time entirely ceased; and in 1902 it was reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had sent a present of camels to Ibn-Sa'ud, the Wahhabi ruler, and had received four horses in return. In September 1905, Wahhabi supremacy having meanwhile been re -established in Najd, where for some years it had been in abeyance, 'Abdul 'Aziz, the son of Ibn-Sa'ud, addressed letters to all the Trucial Shaikhs informing them of his arrival in Qatar and of a reconciliation which he had effected among the Bedouin tribes ot the A1 Morrah, Bani Hajir and 'Ajman; he added that he hoped to visit Trucial 'Oman in the spring of 1906. These communications were received with dismay by the Hinawi Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai, who foresaw a great diminution to their own prestige as a result oi the intrusion of the Wahhabis, and with corresponding relationCsic] by the othei or Ghafiri Shaikhs, who were longing for deliverance from the twenty years' hegemony of Abu Dhabi. A correspondence was at once opened between the Abu Dhabi Shaikh and his lellow Hinawi and ally, the Sultan of Oman, against whose authority the advent of the Wahhabis would dispose his Ghafiri'subjects to rise, indeed the Shaikh of Dhabi considered the matter of sufficient importance to warrant a visit by himself to Masqat in November 1905. A caution against engaging in intrigues with the Wahhabis was at once addressed to all the Trucial Shaikhs by Major P. Z. Cox, the British Political Resident, who happened to be passing through the country on a journey to Baraimi; and later it was repeated under the authority of the Government of India. The matter was then brought unofficially to the notice of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait through Captain Knox, the British Political Agent at that place, a hint being at the same time thrown out that the British Government would view with disapprobation any interference by the Wahhabis in Trucial 'Oman. Shaikh Mubarak, who at first explained the proceedings of Ibn-Sa'ud as a mere device to extort blackmail, and who professed to have remonstrated with him on the subject, afterwards stated that Ibn-Sa'ud had written disclaiming all unfriendly intentions towards the British Government and regretting any harm that might have been caused by careless remarks on his own part. Since then nothing more has been heard of Wahhabi designs in Trucial 'Oman. Relations of Trucial 'Oman with the Sultanate of 'Oman, 1892-1907. constant friendl y intercourse was maintained between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Oman, culminating, as we have seen, in 1905 in mutual consultations regarding the Wahhabi danger 1892-95. In September 1892 the Shaikh ot Dibai made a journey to Masqat; and towards the end of 1895 his successor and a son of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi visited that place, but the object ol their excursion could not be ascertained. 1904. In July 1904 Khalifah and Sultan, two sons of Shaikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi, were received with much honour at Masqat; were dismissed, after a prolonged visit, with costly presents; and were conveyed as far as Sohar on their return iourney by the Sultan's yacht ' Nur-al-Bahr71 It was ascertained in 1906 that, during the last ten years, the Sultan of 'Oman 1906. had been paying a cash subsidy of $3,000 per annum to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on condition of his restraining the Bedouin tribes of Baraimi and Dhahirah from incursions into the Batinah district; and reason was found for believing that, as far eastwards as 'Ibri in Dhahirah and perhaps also in parts of Ruus-al-Jibal, though all of these belonged to the Sultanate, the influence wielded by Shaikh Zaid-bin- Khallfah far outweighed that of Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki. Other foreign relations of Trucial 'Oman, 1892-1907. The Perpetual Treaty of Peace of 1853 had been communicated to the Porte in 1891; and in 1893 the Turkish Government were informed by Her Majesty's Government of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 between the Trucial Shaikhs and Great Britain. In 1895 a Turkish subject, while proceeding down the creek at 'Ajman to embark on a vessel outside, was shot dead from the bank by a watchman who had challenged him and his companions without obtaining a reply. The matter was adjusted by the Resident with the Turkish authorities through the British Assistant Political Agent at Basrah and the Turkish Vice-Consul at Bushehr, the relations of the deceased in the end waiving their claims, which an 'Ajman Shara' court had held to lie against the watchman personally and not against the Shaikh of the principality. In later years, in consequence of the pacification of the country and the development of trade, the attention of foreigners, sometimes of undesirable character, was attracted more frequently than before to Trucial 'Oman. One of these, calling himself Dr. Ibrahim Effendi, settled as a vaccinator at Sharjah during a smallpox epidemic in 1900, fled to Baraimi in 1904 on the appearance of plague in the Gulf, and on his return to the coast made his head-quarters at Abu Dhabi. This individual, who was originally a Jew and afterwards became in succession a Christian, a Shi'ah Muhammadan and a Wahhabi, was for some time assisted in his business by 'Abdur Rahman, a proselyte from Hinduism to Islam. In 1904 Ibrahim Elfendi visited Bombay and there volunteered on terms which were not accepted, to expose the intrigues of a foreign power in Trucial 'Oman. About the same time he also memorialised the Sultan of Turkey to grant him an allowance for what he described as his charitable work in Trucial 'Oman. In 1902-03, as explained in the history of Qatar, a move was made by the Porte to establish a Turkish Mudirate at 'Odaid in the Abu Dhabi Shaikhdom; but it was checkmated by the action of the British Government. In 1904, Herr Toeppen, a German adventurer and pervert to Muhammadanism, informed the British Government that one of the Trucial Shaikhs was trying to obtain German protection; he also offered his services in the matter, as those of a person well acquainted with the country, but they were declined. The lease of the export duty on mother-of-pearl shells at Dibai, already mentioned as having given rise in 1902 or 1903 to a commercial question, was found to have been granted to an employe of the German firm of Wonckhaus; and the Shaikh was accordingly advised not to grant such concessions in future without first consulting the Resident. The Turkish Government informed of the relations between Britain and Trucial 'Oman 1893. Turkish case, 1895. Ibrahim Eflfendi. Turkish subject, 1900-1907. Turkish claim to 'Odaid, 1902-03. German subjects. Internal affairs of Trucial 'Oman, 1892-1907. We come at length to the internal history of the country during fifteen years Friction a period during which, be the cause what it may, actual fighting by land has been bcuveen much less common than formerly, while political combinations have shown more than ordinary stability. To the troubles which befell in 1891 between the Shaikhs of Dibai and Sharjah there succeeded a truce which, having been shaken in September 1892 by the despatch of an armed boat from Dibai to the assistance of 'Ajman against Sharjah, was again solemnly renewed at Dibai in the same month in the presence of Sultan- bin-Muhammad, a leading Shaikh of the Na'im.72 Settlement Ok the Marar case. 1893-94. Bedouin raids. 1895-97. Great fires, 1896-97. Ihe Zora case, 1895- 1905. The migration of the Marar from Dibai to Sharjah, where they permanently settled, continued however to be a source of quarrel between the two principalities so long as the claims arising from the affair remained unadjusted. In November 1893 war was again declared between Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah on the one part and Dibai on the other, and the Shaikh of 'Ajman was subsequently drawn into the fray on the side of his Qasimi allies. In March 1894 a partial reconciliation between the disputants was effected by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, but the Marar question remained unsettled; in the end it necessitated a special visit by the Resident to the Trucial Coast, in the course of which, at a meeting held under the superintendence of Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Assistant Resident, the dispute was finally laid to rest. The Shaikh of Sharjah on this occasion tried to avoid meeting the Resident, and the usual complimentary gifts were in his case consequently withheld. In January 1895 Manasir and A1 Morrah nomads from a distance commenced raiding the whole of the inland districts between Abu Dhabi and Ras-al-Khaimah and were reported to have captured some 400 camels and 100 horses. The Bani Qitab, who were perhaps the principal sufferers, then appealed to the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai; and, on these chiefs calling out their Bedouins, the scourge was temporarily abated. In the following season marauding Manasir from Qatar again made their appearance in Trucial 'Oman; but, finding the inhabitants prepared to resist them, they changed their tactics and paid visits of courtesy to the Shaikhs of Dibai, Sharjah and Umm-al-Qaiwain, whom they thus obliged to entertain them. From Hamriyah, however, the people there not being sufficiently upon their guard, they carried off a number of animals and a few slaves. Before the end of the winter of 1896-97 a check was inflicted on the Manasir by the Bani Qitab, for that tribe, warned by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, with whom they had then recently been reconciled, and assisted by the people of Sharjah, defeated the marauders with loss in a sharp engagement. The towns of Trucial 'Oman, consisting to a large extent of huts of dry date fronds and other inflammable materials, are at all time very liable to damage by fire; but the year 1896 was rendered memorable by an extraordinary series of conflagrations. In the town of Sharjah 400 houses w r ere reported to have been destroyed, and the loss of property was estimated at Rs. 30,000; at Dibai half of the town proper was said to have been wasted by the flames, together with the whole of the Dairah quarter; while at Abu Dhabi 170 houses were burned, and such property as the owners succeeded in rescuing from the blaze was pillaged by Bani Yas Bedouins. In 1897 there were several fires at Dibai, and a slave-woman caught in the act of incendiarism was put to death. The next political incident of importance arose from designs conceived by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in regard to Zora, a sandy tract upon the sea extending from 'Ajman to Hamriyah, but cut off from those places and from the mainland between them by a creek never fordable at more than two places; the advantages of the insular position of Zora had been fully realised by Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah, who aspired to the headship of all the Bedouin tribes of Trucial 'Oman and saw in Zora a safe asylum for the flocks and herds of his allies and an excellent base for operations by himself, in case of hostilities with tribes lying at a distance from Abu Dhabi. In 1895 the Shaikh obtained from the British Residency, to which the full significance of his action was not as yet apparent, permission to send stores by sea for the use of Bedouins whom he had collected at Zora in support of the Bani Qitab, then at war with their neighbours; but, the other Trucial Shaikhs having thrown difficulties in the way, he found himself unable to turn the authority thus granted to account. In 1897 a section of the Sudan tribe under Sultan-bin- Nasir requested the leave of the Resident to colonise Zora; and in 1900, on the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi offering to protect the settlement and promising to assist the inhabitants with non-military stores sent by sea, the desired permission was given: Shaikh Zaid, it may be observed, was himself a Suwaidi on his mothers' side, and a daughter of the Suwaidi Shaikh Sultan-bin-Nasir was among his wives. The Zora scheme was however alarming to the Ghafiri Shaikhs; the Shaikh of 'Ajman at once took steps to protect himself by building a fort near one of the fords connecting Zora with the mainland; and the Shaikh of Sharjah, in September 1900, appealed to the Resident to prevent the establishment of a non- Qasimi stronghold in the midst of Qasimi country. The permission given to colonise was accordingly revoked, to the intense annoyance of Shaikh Zaid, who saw himself thus deprived of one of the chief means on which he had counted for the extension of his influence over all Trucial 'Oman, Ruus-al-Jibai,73 Shamaillyah and Baraimi. It may be added than in March 1905 Major Cox the Political Resident, made a personal inspection of Zora and came to the conclusion that the proposed settlement should not be authorised, unless with the unanimous assent of all the Xrucial Shaikhs, which it was unlikely would ever be a iven In 1900, on the death of Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah of Ras-al-Khaimah that place and its dependencies were re-incorporated with the principality of Sh'ariah from which they had been separated since 1869. The number of the Trucial Shaikhs was thus reduced from six to five, the latter being their original number. The troubles which arose in 1902 between the Shaikh of Sharjah and his vassal the headman of Fujairah in Shamiliyah are fully narrated in an Appendix to this chapter, and at present we are concerned only with their elfects upon the relations of the Trucial Shaikhs with one another. 'The cause of the rebellious headman, who had appealed to the Sultan of Masqat and to the Shaikh of Dibai, was espoused in Trucial 'Oman by the Shaikhs of Dibai and 'Ajman, with whom the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, on account of neglected claims by his subjects against Sharjah, afterwards associated himself; but the influence of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who, with a view to propitiating the Shaikh of Sharjah in the Zora case, had recently formed a close alliance with him, was thrown at first in the opposite scale. No actual hostilities, however, took place among the Trucial Shaikhs in connection with the ShamailTyah dispute. In 1903, on 'the return of the Sharjah Shaikh from an expedition to Shamaiiiyah, the Shaikh of 'Ajman, without prejudice to an offensive and defensive alliance that existed between himself and Dibai, entered into a similar arrangement with Sharjah; and thereafter there was close friendship between them, while the alliance between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi was also maintained. In 1905 Shaikh Saqar-bin-Khalid appeared to have relinquished all idea of coercing the refractory Fujairah headman. A curious difficulty, destined to produce unforeseen and somewhat far- reaching consequences, now occurred in connection with two villages in the upper part of Wadi Hatta in Western Hajar, a valley through which runs a route from Dibai in Trucial 'Oman to the town of Shinas in Batinah. These villages, Hajarain and Masfut, both inhabited by Biduwat, seem to have belonged originally—as the lower part of the Wadi Hatta does still—to the Sultanate of 'Oman; but about 1870, in the reign of Saiyid 'Azzan-bin-Qais, on an irreconcilable quarrel taking place between the two, the people of Masfut placed themselves under the protection of Bani Ka'ab and the Na'im of Baraimi; and at a later period, in the reign of Saiyid Turki, the Sultan of 'Oman in view of his own inability to defend Hajarain against the Na'im of Baraimi, acquiesced in its virtual transfer to the Shaikh of Dibai. Such was the position, when, in 1905, the Bani Qitab, actuated by emnity towards the Na'Tm of Baraimi, occupied the hills at the head of Wadi Hatta, built a fort (called Hauz) to command the road at a spot known as Jabail, and proceeded to annoy passing caravans. In these acts they were countenanced by the people of Masfut, who in so doing apparently took the opposite side from the Na'im protectors, and by Rashid-bm-Ahmad, a new and vigorous Shaikh of Umm-al- Qaiwain, who was said to have supplied funds for the building of the fort; but the Na'im of Baraimi and the Shaikh of Dibai entertained strong objections to the fort and called in the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, whose opinion coincided with their own. In September 1905 the five Trucial Shaikhs held a meeting at Dibai. the venerable Zaid-bin-Khalifah in effect presiding: and it was apparently decided that the Jabail fort should be destroyed, and that the Bani Qitab should restore Masfut, which village had fallen completely under their influence, to the Shaikhs of Baraimi. Shaikh Zaid on this occasion urged Shaikh Rashid to abstain from encouraging the Bani Qitab, and he even obtained from him a promise to comply with this advice; but the young chief of Umm-al-Qaiwain had in reality not the slightest intention of deferring to the venerable doyen of the Trucial Coast, and only a few weeks later he conducted the two leading Shaikhs of the Bedouin Bani Qitab to 'Ajman and Sharjah, where, obviously with the aim of stultifying the policy of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, he reconciled them to the ruling chiefs. Meanwhile, in July or August 1905, a quarrel had arisen in the Dhahirah district of the 'Oman Sultanate between a Baluch colony at Aflaj Bani Qitab and their overlords, the sedentary Bani Qitab of the same place; and attempts were shortly made by the latter to capture the Baluch fort in the hamlet of Mazim. The Baluch thereupon appealed to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for help, and he accord ingly tried to prevent the nomad Bani Qitab from joining their kinsmen in the assault upon Mazim, but without success; the garrison of Mazim, however.

The quarrel was at its height in December 1905 while Major Cox, the British Resident, was journeying from Ras-al-Khaimah to Baraimi, and there was at that time some talk of a combination between the Shaikhs of Umm-al-Qaiwain. Sharjah and 'Ajman for the purpose of supporting the Bam Qitab against the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi; but in reality the Ghafiri Shaikhs were not prepared to go far, and a remonstrance which Major Cox addressed to Shaikh Zaid, referring to the threatened danger of a Wahhabi incursion, was not without sedative effect. But the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was still anxious to convince the Bani Qitab of the impossibility of opposing his wishes and the Shaikh oi Umm- al-Qaiwain of the folly of attempting to compete with his influence in Bedouin affairs; so in February 1906, after notifying a demand for blood-money on account of Baluch slain, he collected his forces and prepared to move against the Bani Qitab. In this extremity the tribe appealed first to the Shaikh of Dibai, who intimated that he regarded the claim for blood-money as just; then to the Shaikh of Sharjah, who declined to have anything to do with the matter; and finally to the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, who, doubtless under great pressure from the Bani Qitab, in the end undertook their case, so violating his recent promise not to afford them encouragement. Finally counsels of moderation prevailed, and a general meeting of chiefs was held at Khawanij near Dibai, which resulted in a setlement. A written agreement, dated about the end of April 1906, was also drawn up, in which the respective spheres of tribal influence of the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Umm-al-Qaiwain were defined; in this document the Bani Qitab, the Ghafalah and the Bani Ka'ab were assigned to Shaikh Rashid, while Shaikh Zaid—in some cases to the prejudice of third parties who were not apparently consulted—obtained the following as dependents: Sultan-bin-Muhammad, Shaikh of the Na'im of Baraimi; Muhammad-bin-Sulaiman, Shaikh of Dariz in Dhahirah; Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, headman of Fujairah in Shamailiyah; and the Shihiih tribe of Ruus-al-Jibal. Jurisdiction over subjects of the Sultan of 'Oman may have been claimed by Shaikh Zaid merely on behalf of that ruler, whose representative and plenipotentiary, in consequence of the strict alliance existing between them, he may have conceived himself to be; but his invasion of the rights of the Shaikh of Sharjah by asserting influence over Fujairah is more difficult to justify; and, were it not for the well-known apathy of Saqar-bin-Khalid, the continuance after this of amicable relations between Abu Dhabi and Sharjah would be inexplicable. The settlement was a triumph for the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain as con firming his right to a voice in Bedouin politics; but it was impossible that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should for long acquiesce in a partition of privileges hitherto exclusively his own with his youthful competitor. Accordingly, about the end of November 1906, having arranged with the Shaikhs of Dibai and Sharjah for their support, he began to collect and arm his adherents among the Manasir and the Bani Hajir tribes and to prejpare for a fresh rupture with the Bani Qitab and for an attack on Falai or Falaj A1 'Ali,—a small but valuable oasis belonging to the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, from whose capital it is distant about 16 miles inland. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, on his part, proceeded to set the defences of Falai in order and applied to the British Resident for assistance in procuring two breach-loading guns to be mounted on the fort,—a request which was of course declined. Major Cox then addressed a forcible remonstrance to both Shaikhs, and a seeming reconciliation took place; but, at the beginning of January 1907, Shaikh Rashid, who had ventured to pay a friendly visit to Shaikh Zaid at his camp in the interior, was, after being hospitably entertained for several days, suddenly seized, thrown into chains, and called on to surrender Falai upon pain of forfeiting his life. On receiving news of this affair the Resident immediately despatched a letter from Biishehr by H.M.S. Proserpine' demanding of Shaikh Zaid that his prisoner should be released; and on the next day, the 17th of February, Major Cox himself followed in the R.I.M.S. ' Lawrence On arrival at Sharjah it was ascertained that the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dibai and 'Ajman had joined the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi at a place 20 miles inland from Sharjah,where they held Shaikh Rashid in confinement and were preparing for an attack on Falai; also that the attendants captured with the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain had been sent by boat to Abu Dhabi,—an act which might reasonably be construed as a breach of the maritime peace. With much difficulty and after a week's negotiations, the Shaikh of Sharjah being employed as an intermediary, Major Cox succeeded in arranging for the unconditional release of Shaikh Rashid, whose appearance when he reached the ' Lawrence ' bore witness to a good deal of physical and mental suffering. After this, in accordance with a friendly understanding that the Resident should, on Umm-al-Qaiwain being set at liberty, mediate between him and the75 other chiefs, two days were devoted by Major Ccx to tedious discussions on shore* in these the Shaikh of Sharjah appeared for himself and for 'Ajman and the Shaikh of Dibai for himself and for Abu Dhabi. The result was a written settlement of all differences by which, it was hoped, general peace might be secured for some time to come. On the conclusion of the negotiations Shaikh Rashid was landed at Umm-al-Qaiwain, where he was received by his subjects with many rejoicings. He seemed grateful for his rescue, and he afterwards presented a thank-offering to the Resident in the shape of a well-bred camel and a young horse, both of which were accepted on behalf of the Government ^ ANNEXURE No. 1.—INTERNAL HISTORY OF THE SHARJAH PRINCIPALITY [pp. 755-763] In the following short summary we propose to deal with the affairs of the ruling family of Sharjah and with events of merely domestic significance. The external history of the Shaikhdom is included in that of Trucial Oman, which is contained in the foregoing chapter. Shaikh Saqar-bin-Rashid, 1777-1803. In 1777 Shaikh Rashid-bin-Matar of Ras-al-Khaimah, the chief of the Qawasim, resigned the headship of the tribe, after holding it for about 30 years, in favour of his son Saqar. Shaikh Saqar married, as one of his wives a daughter of Shaikh Abdullah, Ma'lni, of Qishm. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, 1803-66. J n or about 1803 Shaikh Saqar was succeeded by his son Sultan, who was Place of destined to rule the Qawasim for a period extending over two generations and to residence and witness, it might almost be said, the whole process of change from barbarism to c h a r a cter of civilisation in the Persian Gulf. The internal events of his Shaikhship are less • known as well as less important than the external already related; and it is even saqar 1 1 uncertain whether, after the restoration to him of Ras-al-Khaimah in 1820, he chiefly at that place or at Sharjah. Till the end of his life he was indifterently described as ' Shaikh of Sharjah ' and ' Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and the direct administration of both towns appears to have been ordinarily carried on hy a near relation acting under his orders, and not by himself personally. According to a general consensus of opinion the leading characteristic of Shaikh buJtan was his duplicity, which even by other Arabs was regarded as phenomenal, in his later life his peculiarity in this respect had become so notorious that he was tnoroughly distrusted by all, and his ' machinations seldom produced, compara tively speaking, any evil consequences.' W ear ^ er y ears 0 f his rule Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar generally employed Governors nis brothers, and of a later period his sons, as his representatives in direct charge Ras-al- ot the towns of Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah. Ras-al-Khaimah was governed K hai ™ h and m 1823 by Muhammad-bin-Saqar, a brother of Shaikh Sultan; and he may have i§03-04 remained in office there until his death, which occurred at some time prior to 1845. ? t ^ e a ff a i rs of Sharjah town were guided by Salih-bin-Saqar, another or Shaikh Sultan's brothers, who, though his mother had been a slave, was one or the most intelligent and enlightened Arabs of his day upon the Trucial coast; nis deposition in 1838 in favour of Saqar, the son of Shaikh Sultan by a Qasimi wire, was consequently much regretted by the British political authorities. In 1840, at the instigation of Shaikh Maktum of Dibai, a restless and intriguing Rebellion of cnier, Saqar-bin-Sultan made an effort, which was for a short time successful, to Saqar-bin- cast off the authority of his father and to rule the town of Sharjah as an independent Sult . an principality; he obtained support chiefly by promising to reduce the tax on pearl ff^her, 1840. divers, which was then levied by Shaikh Sultan at the rate of $7 per head annually. 48533 M76 An appeal to arms was at first threatened; but eventually Shaikh Sultan agreed, with much reluctance, to accept an annual tribute from his son and to abstain from direct interference in the affairs of the port. In December 1840 however. Shaikh Salih, the ex-governor of Sharjah, and some other principal residents of the town, disgusted at the influence which the Shaikh of Dibai had acquired over their new Shaikh, banded themselves together to put an end to the usurpation; this they effectually did by surprising Shaikh Saqar asleep and handing him over a prisoner to his justly offended father. Shaikh Sultan then arranged to remove Saqar to Ras-al-Khaimah; but the latter, on the way to his appointed place of exile, broke his arrest and took refuge with the Shaikh of Dibai. Military move ments followed which are described in the history of Trucial Oman, and Shaikh Sultan, after basely betraying his allies, concluded an arrangement with the Shaikh of Dibai, and even replaced Saqar in the government of Sharjah without so much as requiring of him a guarantee not to molest Shaikh Salih and the other loyalists in the town of Sharjah. Administra- Shaikh Saqar continued in charge of Sharjah until his death in battle with the tion of Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain in 1846. He appears to have been succeeded^ by Sharjah town. 'Abdullah, another son of Shaikh Sultan, whose mother belonged to an A1 Ali 1840-55. family of Tavuneh on the Persian Coast. 'Abdullah's government was signalised chiefly by his treacherous attempt, noticed elsewhere, to seize the fort of Ajman in 1848;' but he continued in office until 1855, when he was killed in fighting at Hamriyah. Rebellion of In 1854 occurred the first of a series of rebellions by the inhabitants of the headman Hamriyah, a township on the coast, against the authority of the Shaikh of Sharjah, ?854-55 riyah ' their lawful ruler - The cause of the trouble on this occasion was a blood-feud that arose between the Huwalah of Sharjah town and a body of the Shwaihiyin, recent immigrants into that place, who numbered about 500 fighting men. On the interested advice of Ahmad-as-Sadairi, the Wahhabi representative in Trucial 'Oman, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar somewhat hastily transferred the Shwaihiyin to Hamriyah; and here they immediately began to concert measures with Abdur Rahman-bin-Saif, the headman of the village, for asserting the independence of the place against Sharjah. When Captain Kemball, the British Political Resident, visited the Trucial Coast on his annual tour in September 1854, he was approached by Shaikh Sultan with a request for permission to coerce the people of Hamriyah by maritime operations; but Captain Kemball, though unwilling to encourage the rebels, persuaded the Shaikh—chiefly on the ground that, as Hamriyah was situated between 'Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain, the Shaikhs of those places might be drawn into the fray—to promise that he would postpone proceedings by sea and not undertake them, even in the last resort, without a further reference to the Residency. Affairs at Lingeh, where his young relation Khalifah-bin-Sa'id—a minor— was chief, obliged Shaikh Sultan after This interview to spend several months on the Persian coast. During his absence he rashly entrusted the handling of the Hamriyah affair to Ahmad-as-Sadairi, the Wahhabi representative. This faithless individual, after doing his utmost under pretence of mediation to aggravate the quarrel, attempted to introduce a Wahhabi garrison of his own into the fort of Hamriyah; and, on the failure of this scheme, he induced Shaikh Sultan, who had meanwhile returned home, to undertake operations by sea and land against the refractory township. Captain Kemball, arriving off Hamriyah in the ' Clive ' on the 31st of May 1855, found that the place had already been invested for 25 days, during which period no letter on the subject from Shaikh Sultan had reached him, though it was stated that one had been despatched. The besieging force consisted of the Qasimi Shaikh's own levies, of the Wahhabi agent's retinue of 150 men, and of a contingent from 'Ajman upwards of 3,000 strong; and their artillery amounted to five guns, of which two had been brought from Lingeh, two from Sharjah by sea, and one from 'Ajman. The strength of the besieged was about 800 fighting men only; but they enjoyed the countenance, if not the actual support, of the Shaikhs of Dibai and Umm-al-Qaiwain, to whom the embarrass ments of their powerful neighbour of Sharjah were generally a source of relief. The fighting had been of an unusually obstinate character and the result highly favourable to the besieged; for, while the assailants had lost over 60 men killed, including 'Abdullah, the son of the Qasimi Shaikh, and double that number wounded, the casualties of the garrison were believed not to exceed 10 men killed. In these' circumstances Shaikh Sultan eagerly sought the good offices of the Resident, by means of which he hoped that he might be enabled to retire without77 utter disgrace from an impossible enterprise; and Captain Kembail, while absolutely declining to guarantee any settlement that might be arranged, undertook the office of mediator. The headman of Hamrlyah and the Shwaihiyin refugees, emboldened by their successful defence and instigated by the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, would not at first listen to any proposals; but eventually, on the Resident threatening a strict enforcement of the maritime peace, whereby apparently their supplies would have been altogether cut off, it was settled that $500 should be paid by the rebels to the Shaikh of Sharjah in token of submission, and that, on the conclusion of the pearl season, the Shwaihiyin should quit Hamrlyah and settle wherever else they pleased. The Residency Agent, Haji Ya'qub, was sent on shore to witness the formal submission of the rebels to the Shaikh; and the H. E. 1. Company's schooner ' Constance ' remained at the place for a few days longer until the besiegers had broken up their camp and retired. From the predominance in Sharjab ;own at the present day of the Shwaihiyin tribe it would seem that Shaikh Sultan must eventually have succeeded in persuading the malcontents to return there. In 1860, and probably for some time before, Ras-al-Khaimah was ruled by Ibrahim-bin-Sultan, the son of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar by a wife of the MarazTq or Marzuqi tribe; and in 1855 Mashari, a son of Ibrahim, had been appointed sub- governor of Dibah, and had been murdered there by tribesmen of the Shihuh. When Shaikh Sultan died, in 1866, Ibrahim still held charge of Ras-al-Khaimah. On the death of 'Abdullah-bin-Sultan in the operations at Hamrlyah in 1855, the administration of Sharjah town seems to have been assumed by Muhammad- bin-Saqar, a grandson of Shaikh Sultan; but intrigues for the removal of this young man were shortly commenced by Khalid-bin-Sultan, one of his uncles. The aged Qasimi Shaikh who had at last fallen into his dotage and lost both memory and hearing, seems now to have counted for little in the disputes among his unruly progeny. About 1859, Shaikh Khalid having formed a strong party in Sharjah, the town was for a time divided between him and Shaikh Muhammad, each presiding over his own adherents; but such a state of matters could not long endure, and, at the end of 1860 or beginning of 1861, Shaikh Khalid, having 'decoyed Shaikh Muhammad to a distance from Sharjah in the course of a morning ride, suddenly shot him with his own hand and threw his body into a well. Shortly afterwards, on Captain Felix Jones paying a visit to the coast, Shaikh Khalid sought an interview with him; but it was refused on the ground that the Resident could not hold converse with ' one so recently and so fearfully polluted.' Early in 1860 the Shaikh of Sharjah, by which term must be understood at this time either Shaikh Muhammad or Shaikh Khalid, called upon the headman of Hamriyah to assist him in a land attack in which he was engaged upon the villages, then disaffected, of Khan and Abu Hail. 'Abdur Rahman-bin-Saif was rash enough to respond by proceeding to the scene of hostilities by sea with armed men and munitions of war and was fined $250 by order of the Political Resident. This sum he duly disbursed on a demand for payment being preferred by Commander Cruttenden. Governors of Ras-al- Khaimah and Sharjah, 1855 to 1866.

In April 1869 the agent of the Wahhabis at Baraimi came to Sharjah, and, under cover of arbitrating in some disputes upon the coast, proceeded to plot the imprisonment of Shaikh Salim, the establishment of his brother Shaikh Ibrahim at Ras-al-Khaimah, and the transfer of Shaikh Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah from Ras-al- Khaimah, to Sharjah. An affray however arose in the town; and the death of the Wahhabi agent who was struck by a bullet, put an end to these designs^ Shaikh Salim, apparently with a view to disarming the resentment ol the Wahhabi Amir, then went through the form of resigning the chiefship in favour ol his brother Ibrahim; but the two remained in close relations, and there was probably no real transfer of authority. A few months later, the Wahhabis remaining inactive. Shaikh Salim openly resumed his position as principal Shaikh. Meanwhile, early in May 1869, Colonel Pelly, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, while on his way to Masqat in the ' Dalhousie,' received intelligence at Lingeh that a serious breach of the maritime peace was threatened by the Qawasim in the neighbourhood of Ras-al-Khaimah. Taking the gunboat ' Hugh Rose ' in tow, he crossed the Gulf to Ras-al-Khaimah, and, arriving there on the J2th of May, found that Shaikhs Salim and Ibrahim of Sharjah had in fact proceeded by sea to expel Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah from Ras-al-Khaimah, near which town they had landed 1,500 men from boats and now occupied a position protected on the landward side by a creek in which their fleet, amounting to 32 vessels, was hauled up. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain had sent some 500 men by sea to the assistance of Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah; and fighting had already occured both at Jazirat-al-Hamra and in front of Ras-al-Khaimah town. On the evening of his arrival Colonel Pelly received on board his vessel the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, who assured him that the sole object of the attack was to place Shaikh Ibrahim in possession of the town; and on the 13th of May, after an interview with the leaders on the opposite side. Colonel Pelly ordered Shaikhs Salim and Ibrahim to withdraw their fleet and forces by sunset. The Resident remained on the spot until dark, by which time all the vessels of the attacking force had defiled out of the creek; he then continued on his way to Masqat, where his presence was urgently required. Colonel Pelly's ' prompt and judicious measures ' on this occasion were subsequently approved by the Government of India. In 1871 dissensions apparently prevailed between Shaikhs Salim and Ibrahim at Sharjah and the latter had possibly obtained a partial ascendancy in the town, for, taking advantage of his temporary absence at Abu Dhabi, Shaikh Salim called in his nephew Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah of Ras-al-Khaimah and the Shaikh of Umm- al-Qaiwain, and with their assistance made himself undisputed master of Sharjah. Soon after this affair Hamaid consolidated his position at Ras-al-Khaimah by re-annexing Shalam, Rams and the Shimil village in Sir, which had at some time separated themselves from his principality. In 1873 it was reported that Shaikh Salim found difficulty in meeting certain financial liabilities which he had assumed on behalf of his ' predecessor a term which in this case was probably intended to apply to Shaikh Ibrahim. In 1873, as mentioned in the history of Trucial 'Oman, the headman of Hamriyah, at this time Saif-bin-'Abdur Rahman, joined a general combination of chiefs against his overlord the Shaikh of Sharjah. from which he again in 1874 withdrew; and in 1875 he was engaged, apparently as a neutral, in mediating a peace among the remaining belligerents. Soon afterwards, in 1875 or 1876, he seems to have seceded from Sharjah and proclaimed his independence, with the result that a number of difficult claims and counter-claims, some of old standing, arose between the two places. Shaikh Saqar-bin-Khalid, 1883 to the present time. Usurpation of At the end of March 1883, Shaikh Salim having gone for a change of air to the Shaikh- Musa Island, where his horses were at grass, and his brother Ahmad having bhvKhalid? ar proceeded on a journey to Ras-al-Khaimah, their nephew Saqar-bin-Khalid, a youth March, 1883. of 20 years or less who had been left in charge of Sharjah, seized the opportunity to proclaim himself ruler. He was shortly recognised as such by the Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah, Umm-al-Qaiwain, 'Ajman and Dibai; and he also obtained the support of Muhammad-bin-'Ali, a chief of the Bedouin Na'im, and of Mutawwa 'Khasuwani, the leader of a band of Bani Qitab freebooters. This79 revolution was facilitated by the unpopularity of Shaikh Salim, attributable to his partiality for men of religion and to his indifference to the interests of his subjects; but in general character Salim was not, perhaps, inferior to his successor, who soon proved to be weak and unobservant of his promises. Shaikh Salim retained possession of Bu Musa; but in May he paid a visit to Yusuf, one of the Qasimi Shaikhs in Lingeh, and in July he moved to Dibai, where a settlement, guaranteed by the Shaikhs of Rasal-Khaimah and Dibai, was arranged between himself and his usurping nephew. Under the terms of this agreement Salim was to acknowledge the Shaikhship oi Saqar and was m return to receive an annual pension of $600 and to retain his personal property at Sharjah and Dhaid, while his debts at Sharjah were to be discharged by Saqar. In 1884 there were complaints on both sides that this agreement was not being intervention observed, and the guarantors apparently held that the blame rested with Salim, of the British who was reported to be again living on Bu Musa. In the meantime Shaikh Saqar P olltlc ^ allied himself by marriage to the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. Up to this point the Resident had avoided all connection with the dispute, refusing to give advice or instructions to Saqar on his accession and declining to take special security against breach of the maritime peace from Shaikh Salim; but in June 1884, on Shaikh Salim appearing at 'Ajman, the Residency Agent at Sharjah was able to arrange a friendly meeting between him and Shaikh Saqar at 'Ajman. On this occasion a written document was executed by Shaikh Saqar in favour of Salim, in which it was promised that the latter should receive a pension of $400 a year, half in kind and half in cash, also the revenue of the island of Sir Bu Na'air, which sometimes amounted to $200 annually, and, finally, a sum of $250 on account of the past year. In April 1884 a fatuous attempt was made by the new Shaikh of Sharjah to Futile effort recover Hamrlyah, which, apparently ever since its secession in 1875, had continued b y Shaikh to enjoy virtual independence. The expedient adopted was to invite Saif-bin- reSn^^Ham- 'Abdur Rahman, headman of Hamnyah, to Sharjah, and on his arrival there to ri y a h, 1884. despatch his brother Muhammad-bin-'Abdur Rahman to take charge of the place in the interest of the Shaikh of Sharjah. The coup was effected as arranged; but Saif, on his return to Hamriyah, at once expelled his brother Muhammad without the slightest difficulty. In December 1885, Sh'am having revolted against the Shaikh of Ras-al- Expedition by Khaimah, that chief, assisted by his cousin the Shaikh of Sharjah, proceeded against the place and quickly reduced it to submission, inflicting a fine of $1,600, of which Khaimah' a portion was paid at once. and Sharjah, 1885. The expelled Shaikh, Salim, continued to watch for an opportunity of obtaining Proceedings better terms than he had yet received from his successful rival. In June 1886, on a combination being formed by the Shaikhs of Dibai, 'Ajman and Hamriyah d lm, against the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, Salim once more landed at 'Ajman; but no opportunity having occurred of prosecuting his designs against Sharjah, he shortly returned to Bu Musa. In 1888 Salim paid a visit to Dibai, between the Shaikh of which place and the Shaikh of Sharjah enmity at the time prevailed; a reconciliation, however, having taken place between the two, he was persuaded by the Shaikh of Dibai to promise, in return for the restoration of his pension, which had been suspended, to abstain from intrigues against his nephew. In April 1889, nevertheless, he organised an attack upon Sharjah; but he was unable to carry it out. Again, a little later, he became reconciled to Shaikh Saqar, who this time received him into favour and appointed him his Wazlr. On the 2nd of August 1900 Hamaid-bin-'Abdullah, Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, Re-incorpora- was removed by a paralytic stroke, and Shaikh Saqar-bin-Khalid in the following Ra u' month re-annexed the town and district to his principality of Sharjah without ^j th t ^ a encountering any opposition. Shaikh Saqar at first placed his cousin Hamad-bin- sharjah Majid in charge of Ras-al-Khaimah; but a few months later, having found his Shaikhdom, conduct unsatisfactory, he substituted his own son Khalid as governor. 1900 - The township of Hamriyah, of which the headman on the occasion of Lord Hamriyah Curzon's visit to the coast, in November 1903, vainly sought to obtain recognition as an independent Trucial Shaikh, continued in theory attached to the Sharjah principality and in practice virtually independent; the reason of the prolonged estrangement was chiefly, so far as could be ascertained, the neglect or incapacity of the Shaikh of Sharjah to protect the interests of his vassal when assailed by others. On the 3rd of September 1904 a change of headmen occurred at Hamriyah by the death of Saif-bin-'Abdur Rahman and the succession of his son 'Abdur Rahman-bin-Saif. The latter soon resigned his position in favour of an elderPolitical position and personal character of the Shaikh of Sharjah, 1907. relation named Saif-bin-Saif, of whose ambition he stood in dread; but, on the latter proceeding to despoil him of his personal property, 'Abdur Rahman attacked the house of Saif by night, taking him prisoner and killing his son, and himself resumed the headship of Hamriyah. Shaikh Rashid of Umm-al-Qaiwain then intervened and settled the matter by removing Saif-bin-Saif to his own capital Under Saqar-bin-Khalid the importance of Sharjah among the Shaikhdoms of Trucial 'Oman declined, and the prestige of the Qasimi name sunk to an unprecedentedly low level. In private life the Shaikh was weak, miserly, and uxorious: in public business he was apathetic and seemed incapable of exertion He alienated his subjects and former Bedouin adherents by indifference to their grievances and requests; and he forfeited the respect of the other Trucial Shaikhs by his general insignificance, both as a man and as a ruler. In his personal relations with British olFicers Shaikh Saqar always showed himself friendly and well-disposed- but, from indolence, he was sometimes remiss in enforcing the just claims of British subjects; and on the occurrence of internal difficulties in his state, he manifested too great a disposition to rely on the help of the British Residency, instead of grappling with them himself. In 1904 the general dissatisfaction of his subjects with his rule found expression in a plot to depose Shaikh Saqar in favour of his uncle, the ex-Shaikh Salim; but timely information enabled Shaikh Saqar to frustrate the intrigue and Muhammad-bin-Khadim, one of the chief conspirators was obliged, on escaping from custody, to seek refuge at Umm-al-Qaiwain. The direct administration of the town of Sharjah was held, until his death about 1906 by Shaikh Saqar's son Rashid,—a young man who in character resembled his father; and Ras-al-Khaimah was in 1907 still governed by Khalid, the only son then surviving of the Shaikh.

ANNEXURE No. 2.—INTERNAL HISTORY OF THE ABU DHABI PRINCIPALITY. [pp. 763-772] As in the case of Sharjah it appears advisable to devote a short separate notice to the internal affairs of the Abu Dhabi principality, of which the external history has been given in the preceding chapter. Early history, 1761-1818. The foundation of the town of Abu Dhabi is ascribed to the year 1761. The surrounding country was then already occupied by the Bani Yas,—a land-faring Bedouin tribe who, until the accidental discovery of water at the site of Abu Dhabi town, where a small village of 20 houses now sprang up, had not apparently a single permanent settlement upon the coast. For information regarding the chiefs of the tribe at the time of the establish ment ol the Abu Dhabi principality the reader is referred to the genealogical table of the Bani Yas Shaikhs. Probably the last Shaikh to reside chiefly in the interior was Dhiyab-bin-Isa, who in 1793 was murdered by his second cousin, Hazza'-bin- Zaid. The death of Dhiyab was amply avenged by his son Shakhbut, for the young Shaikh succeeded in putting to death no fewer than ten persons who had been present at his father's assassination; and in 1795 Hazza', the actual murderer, found himself obliged, from fear of a similar fate, to fly the country along with all his supporters. Shaikh Shakhbut remained at the head of the tribe until 1816; he was then deposed by his son Muhammad, who ruled for two years. Shaikh Tahnun-bin-Shakhbut, 1818-33. In 1818 Muhammad was expelled from Abu Dhabi by his brother Tahnun,— an enterprise favoured by Shakhbut, the father of both, by a majority of the Bam Yas tribe, and by the ruler of Masqat who afforded material assistance.* Such is the account given by Lieutenant Hennell about 1831, see Bombay Selections, XXIK page 464: but Lieutenant McLeod, writing in 1823, states that Tahnun was set up by the ruler oi Masqat about 1821 in place of his father, his brother Muhammad at the same time taking night Signature of the General Treaty of peace on behalf of Abu Dhabi was in any case performed (on the 11th of January 1820) by Shaikh Shakhbut, who in 1833 was still alive; but it is certain that in January 1823 Tahnun already held the sole power.Muhammad sought refuge at Dohah in Qatar under the protection of the Shaikh of Bahrain, while Tahnun became Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, but for a time associated his father with himself in the administration and employed him on important missions, particularly on that of negotiating a peace with the commander of the British expedition against Ras-al-Khaimah in 1819-20. The accession of Tahnun to power under the auspices of Masqat was the beginning of a permanent breach between the Qawasim and the Bani Yas, who, if tradition may be believed, had hitherto lived as close friends and allies. In 1821 or 1822, some time after the accession of Shaikh Tahnun, an Movements individual named Suwaidan-bin-Za'al, who appears to have been head of the of Su waidan- Maharibah section of the Bani Yas, absconded from Abu Dhabi in order to avoid ^2-23 ' payment of his debts, and adopted a roving and predatory life. Action was at once taken against him by Shaikh Tahnun, who succeeded in capturing some of his boats; but these proceedings were viewed by the British authorities of the day with disapproval, as endangering the tranquility of the seas; and the Shaikh was even required, on pain of a British war vessel being sent against his port, to desist from them and to give up the vessels which he had seized. At the end of the year Suwaidan paid a visit to Masqat, where he received a present from Saiyid Sa'ld, and in January 1823 he was reported to have settled down quietly on the island of Yas. A different view ol Suwaidan's character now apparently presented itself to the local British officers, for we find the Resident advising him to make his submission to Shaikh Tahnun and even encouraging the latter, on certain conditions, to reduce him by force. Eventually Suwaidan was reconciled to his chief and returned to Abu Dhabi in 1828. Late in the year 1823 the ex-Shaikh Muhammad, whose headquarters were Attack on now at Dohah in Qatar, appeared before Abu Dhabi at the head of 'a number of Abu ^ habi Manasir Bedouins and attacked and plundered the town; but he was driven out ex^Shaikh with a loss of 35 men by his brother Tahnun, who hastened to the spot with a large Muhammad, force from the interior. Retreating northwards he took refuge in Sharjah, whither 1823. Tahnun followed by land and demanded his surrender; but, before matters came to a crisis between the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, the Muhammad relieved the latter of his presence by returning to Qatar. Shaikh Tahnun had long distrusted his brothers Khallfah and Sultan and Assassination had kept them at a distance from Abu Dhabi; but he was at length persuaded by ^ Shaikh his father, Shakhbut, to allow them to return. Soon afterwards they were found April'7833 to have entered with some of the principal residents of Abu Dhabi into a plot for the removal of Tahnun,—an act of treason with which the Shaikh prepared to deal by throwing some of their confederates into prison. This precaution, however, was not sufficient. On the contrary it precipitated the action of the conspirators; and in April 1833 Shaikh Tahnun fell a victim to the pistol of his brother Khalifah and the dagger of his brother Sultan. Shaikh Khalifah-bin-Shakhbut, 1833-45. Khalifah and Sultan at first ruled in partnership; but gradually the Accession of predominance of Khalifah declared itself, and Sultan descended to a subordinate place. A tender of allegiance and Zakat on the part of the usurpers was readily 1 a accepted by the Wahhabi Amir, who at once took them under his protection and forbade the Qasimi Shaikh of Sharjah to meddle in their affairs. In the course of the following summer a conspiracy was formed by some Plot against malcontents at Abu Dhabi to murder Shaikh KhalTfah and replace him by one of Shaikh Kha- his first cousins; but the cousin whom it was intended to benefit himself divulged llfah ' 1833 * the plot to the Shaikh, who, retiring into his fort, seized three of the ringleaders and put them to death. He was also about to execute two influential merchants; but popular indignation and the opposition of his brother Sultan diverted him from his purpose and obliged him to be satisfied instead with the expulsion of one of the merchants named Bin-Tyan, whom, after beating and despoiling of his property, he sent in a Baqarah to Lingeh. This violence on the part of Shaikh Khalifah was highly prejudicial to his Secession of own interests, for it led to the secession from Abu Dhabi to Dibai, during the pearl the Al Bn fishery, of a large number of Bani Yas of the Al Bu Falasah section. Dibai, of ^baf^S^ which the date of foundation cannot be fixed but may have been later than that of Abu Dhabi, seems to have been readily surrendered by the individual who then governed it on behalf of Shaikh Khalifah to the seceders; and they, in the following82 autumn, were joined there by the bulk of their relatives, returning from the pearl banks. The secession was permanent, almost the entire body of the Al Bu Falasah being to the present day domiciled at Dibai; and that place, which had hitherto been a dependency of Abu Dhabi, became after 1833 a dangerous rival, and at times enemy, of the parent state. The attack on and subsequent blockade of Abu Dhabi town by the Shaikh of Sharjah in the autumn of 1833 were due to the dissensions, which appeared to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar to provide an excellent opportunity of crushing the Bani Yas chief on pretext of obtaining justice for the merchant Bin-Tyan; but the result was far from answering to the expectations of the wily intriguer. First In 1835, when heavy damages on account of piratical outrages by the Bani secession of Yas were being recovered by the British Government from the Shaikh of Abu the Qubaisat Dhabi, the subjects of Shaikh Khalifah began to disperse in all directions with a 1835 37 v ^ ew t0 avo ^i n g payment of their individual contributions; and it even became necessary for the British authorities to request other Shaikhs to abstain from affording asylum to fugitives from Abu Dhabi. It was impossible, however, to prevent by these means the emigration of the Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas, who now. under the leadership of Khadim-bin- Na'aman and leaving their debts at Abu Dhabi unsettled, removed in a body to Khor-al-'Odaid,—an inlet of the uninhabited coast near the base of the Qatar promontory, distant nearly 200 miles from Abu Dhabi. The British Resident made an effort to reconcile the Qubaisat with their chief and to induce them to return to their allegiance, but it was unsuccessful; and soon afterwards it was reported that the settlers at 'Odaid were affording encouragement to pirates, especially to the notorious Jasim-bin-Jabir, Raqraqi, whose depredations occasioned a British naval demonstration along the Qatar coast in 1836, as related in the history of that promontory. The usual headquarters of the pirates were at Mirfah, an anchorage on the coast of Taff in Dhafrah, where they were accustomed to bring their spoil ashore and load it on camels for despatch to different destinations; but Jasim had in the first instance issued from 'Odaid, and the headman of that place continued to countenance him so long as he dared. At length in May 1837, permission to take such measures as were necessary having been accorded by the Resident, Shaikh Khalifah contrived to fall without warning upon the 'Odaid settlement, which he completely destroyed: 50 of the inhabitants were killed; the fortifications and houses were dismantled; and the wells were filled up with the ruins of the buildings and the bodies of the slain. A number of the Qubaisat then took refuge at Dibai, and probably at other places also; but, when they saw that some of their number who had gone back to Abu Dhabi were treated with indulgence and had their boats restored to them, they accepted a general amnesty offered by Shaikh Khalifah and returned to their homes and their allegiance, among them being Khadim-bin-Na'aman, the chief of the seceders. Assassination In July 1845, in circumstances which are not fully explained, Shaikh Tahnun with his brother Sultan was treacherously murdered by one Tsa-bin-Khalid, who had long been lying in wait for his life. The deed was committed at a season when the town was almost deserted by its inhabitants, these having gone either to the pearl banks or to the date groves of Llwah; and it formed the conclusion ol a least of which the victims had just partaken, at the invitation of the murderers, under the shade of a BaUl drawn up upon the beach. Notwithstanding the fratricidal crime by which he first attained to power, but which we may consider to have been expiated by the manner of his own death, the rule of Shaikh Khalifah had been in every respect creditable to his character. By his gallantry, firmness and prudence he raised the Abu Dhabi principality to a position much higher than it had ever before occupied; and at the same time he maintained, at least after 1835, a good understanding with the British authorities, and restrained his subjects to the best of his ability from breaches of the maritime peace. Interregnum, 1845. On the death of Shaikh Khalifah the headship of the Bani Yas was assumed by the principal assassin, Tsa-bin-Khalid, apparently with the consent of such of the tribe as were then at hand; but two months later the usurper was cut off by Dhiyab-bin-Tsa, who from his name may be supposed to have been a first cousin of Shaikh Khalifah, 1845. Administra tion of Shaikh Khalifah.of Shaikh Khalifah. Dhiyab was slain in his turn by Khalid-bin-'Isa, a son of his victim; but this individual, instead of attempting to secure the Shaikhdom for himself, prudently returned, after avenging his father's death, to Sharjah whence he had set out. A brother of Khalid contrived to obtain possession of the fort of Abu Dhabi; but he was speedily ejected by Muhammad-bin-Hamaid and Rashid- bin-Fadhil, two influential leaders of the Bani Yas, who now declared for Sa'id, a son of the former Shaikh Tahnun and consequently nephew of the late Shaikh Khalifah. Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Tahnun, 1845-55. The chief authority was retained in their own hands by Muhammad and Accession of Rashid until the arrival of Shaikh Sa'id, who, being generally regarded as the ^45 SaId ' most eligible chief, and being supported moreover by the moral influence of the British Political Resident, established himself in power without any difficulty. In 1849, dissatisfied at the favour shown by Shaikh Sa'id to the Mahafibah Second section of the Bani Yas with whom they were at feud, encouraged also by the ^'essmn of Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dibai to hope that the Wahhabi Amir would shortly assist the L Qubaisat them to establish themselves at 'Odaid, the Qubaisat of Abu Dhabi once more to 'Obaid, abandoned their homes and settled temporarily at Dohah in Qatar. Effectual 1849. measures to compel their return were at once taken, in November or December 1849, by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. After imprisoning some of the Qubaisat who still remained at Abu Dhabi, he sent for the leaders of the Dohah colony and on their arrival gave them a flattering reception. During the following night, however, the boats in which they had come were stripped of masts, sails and all other gear; and the entrapped envoys, thus deprived of the means of escape, found themselves obliged to agree to the terms imposed by the Shaikh, which included, besides return from Dohah, the satisfaction of all debts due by the Qubaisat to private creditors and the payment of a fine to himself. In 1855 Shaikh Sa'id became embroiled with the entire body of his subjects. Expulsion of The occasion was the murder by a tribal elder of his own brother, apparently not Shaikh Sa'id without justification, for the Bani Yas as a whole sided with the elder and resisted of shaikh S10n the intention of Shaikh Sa-id to put him to death. On a promise given by the ^aid. ^55 Shaikh to remit both that and every other penalty the murderer was brought into his presence, whereupon Sa'id, reverting to his original determination, drew his dagger and with his own hand struck the man dead. The populace at once rose in arms; and Shaikh Sa'id, after defending himself for some time in his citadel, escaped to the Persian island of Qais, taking with him most of his property both in goods and cattle. To the British Residency the Shaikh represented his expulsion as due to efforts which he had made to punish a piracy, committed by Bani Yas of the Hawamil and Maharibah sections, upon a Shu'ai belonging to one 'Abdul Karim. Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah, from 1855. On the flight of Shaikh Sa'ld-bin-Tahnun, his first cousin, Shaikh Zaid-bin- Khalifah, was elected to succeed him. According to an arrangement apparently customary among the Bani Yas, a brother named Dhiyab was associated with Zaid in the government; but as usual nothing was heard, after the first, of the assistant chief. In July 1856 a piratical and altogether unexpected descent upon the town of ^ tac ^ h 0 ?- Abu Dhabi was made by the exiled Shaikh, Sa'ld-bin-Tahnun, who in this affair tow u n by a t ^ e took Sharjah for his base of operations; his fleet consisted of three vessels, all ex-Shaikh small, of which one was his own, one belonged to the island of Qais, and the other Sa'id, 1856. was obtained at Abu Hail in the Sharjah principality. On the 19th of July, the principal Shaikh (Zaid) being then absent in Dhafrah, Sa'ld-bin-Tahnun landed at Abu Dhabi and obtained possession of the town, which was plundered by his adherents; Shaikh Dhiyab and the few inhabitants then present at Abu Dhabi shut themselves up in the fort, and there held out until the arrival of Shaikh Zaid from the interior with a party of Bedouins. On the appearance oi the relieving 48533 N84 Third secession of the Qubaisat to 'Odaid, 1869-80. 1869. 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874-75. 1876-77. force the invaders were immediately discomfited: Sa'id-bin-Tahnun himself was among the slain. As mentioned in the history of Trucial 'Oman, the damage done at Abu Dhabi on this occasion was partially made good out of a large fine of $25,000, imposed on the Shaikh of Sharjah because of the complicity of some of his subjects in the raid. In nothing does the essential Bedouin character of the subjects of the Abu Dhabi Shaikh appear more distinctly than in the readiness with which, on slight provocation, they abandon their homes_and settle elsewhere. We have already noticed the permanent hiving-off of the A1 Bu Falasah in 1833 and the temporary secession of the Qubaisat in 1835-37 and 1849, and mention must now be made of a sustained effort on the part of the Qubaisat to free themselves by removal to a distance, from the control of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. In 1869, for reasons not ascertained and therefore probably of slight importance, a body of the Qubaisat under the leadership of Buti-bin-Khadin once more forsook Abu Dhabi and established themselves in the remote creek of 'Odaid. In 1871, in consequence of complaints by Shaikh Zaid that the prosperity of Abu Dhabi was diminished by the competition of the 'Odaid settlement and that the latter had become a city of refuge for fraudulently absconding debtors, Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf, made careful enquiries both personally and through his Assistant, Major Smith, regarding the ownership of 'Odaid; the result was to show that 'Odaid itself, to which at this time no Shaikh of Qatar so much as laid claim, was undoubtedly situated within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The 'Odaid colonists, however, claimed to form a state entirely independent of Abu Dhabi; they asserted that their territory extended half way from 'Odaid to Wakrah on the side of Qatar, and in the other direction as far as the island of Yas, and that it included Dalmah and other adjacent islands formerly considered to belong to Abu Dhabi; moreover, while they expressed a wish to continue under the Trucial flag, they hinted not obscurely that, if their pretensions were not admitted, they would place themselves under the protection of the Turks, who had now arrived in Qatar. Colonel Pelly asked that he might be given instructions for dealing with the matter, inasmuch as the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, relying on the Perpetual Treaty of Peace of 1853, had claimed his intervention as an arbitrator. The orders of the Government of India, communicated in May 1872, were to the effect that no action by the Resident v/as called for under the Maritime Truce, no attack having been made by sea upon the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and that Colonel Pelly should not interfere unless he apprehended a breach of the peace at sea between the parties; but that he should report at once any overt action indicating an intention on the part of the 1 urks to establish their supremacy at 'Odaid. The position remained unchanged until 1873, when Colonel Ross, who had meanwhile succeeded Colonel Pelly in charge of the Gulf Residency, reported an application by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for leave to take naval action against the Odaid rebels; it was explained that an expedition by land was impracticable on account of physical obstacles. Colonel Ross was inclined to think that refusal of sanction might throw the Shaikh himself into the arms of the Porte; but the Government of India in reply directed him to avoid, if possible, giving any answer to Za id s request, and, in the opposite case, to inform him that the Government of India could not countenance, and would even prevent, the proposed naval expedition. In 1874 the Shaikh, having repeated his request in regard to an expedition by sea, was informed of the prohibition of the Government of India; and in 1875 he stated that he had received letters from the Turks, ordering him to abstain from interference with Odaid. At this time it was reported that the 'Odaid settlement possessed both a Trucial and a Turkish flag, and that either was flown as the circumstances of the moment happened to dictate. In 1876—77, various piracies having been committed by Bedouins belonging to the neighbourhood of Odaio, a strict enquiry was made into the behaviour and circumstances of the colonists. It was stated that some Turks had previously visited Odaid, and that a small annual tribute of $40 or 50 was now paid by the inhabitants to the Turkish Government. In regard to the piracies, it was shown that the offenders were A1 Morrah, who had made use of creeks and anchorages and even of vessels belonging to 'Odaid,—proceedings which the headman of Odaid was not in a position to prevent. In consequence of this last discovery the case took a new departure; and, in May 1877, the Government of85 India directed the Resident to use his best endeavours to promote a reunion between the settlers at 'Odaid and the main body of the Bani Yas tribe, at the same time authorising him, in case of non-success, to assist the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in coercing the seceders. These instructions were duly approved by the Secretary of State for India, and steps towards their execution were at once taken by Captain Prideaux, the Acting Political Resident in the Gulf; but he was not able to bring about any agreement. Matters were further complicated by a piracy by 'Odaid boats upon a Wakrah boat, which occurred in April and obliged Captain Prideaux to insist on the liberation of some prisoners who were confined at 'Odaid. In December 1877 Colonel Ross, who had meanwhile returned to his post, reported that his efforts at reconciliation had failed in consequence of the reliance which the headman of 'Odaid now placed on the help of the Turks and did not hesitate to express, even in writing. He further applied for the services of a war vessel for the purpose of executing his instructions, and the ' Teazer ' was placed at his disposal. On the arrival of this ship at 'Odaid it was found that the settlers had fled, first dismantling their houses and filling up the wells. These transactions led to a discussion with the Turkish Government which is described in another place. The Odaid fugitives found an asylum at Dohah in Qatar, where apparently 1880. they resided during 1879; but in January 1880 they accepted an offer of Shaikh Zaid to let them return to Abu Dhabi; and, a short time after, the Shaikh's son Khalifah went in person to bring them home. They were obliged to escape secretly from Dohah, where Jasim, the A1 Thani Shaikh, would now have compelled them to remain; but they reached Abu Dhabi in safety, resumed their allegiance to their chief, and received back their date palms and other property. Later questions affecting 'Odaid are connected with the history of Qatar rather than with that of Abu Dhabi. We may now consider shortly the recent history of the Baraimi Oasis, which. Affairs in after the expulsion of the Wahhabis in 1869, ceased to play an important part in the general history of Trucial 'Oman and became almost an annexe of the principality of Abu Dhabi. At the beginning of 1875 a state of war existed between the Bani Yas and the 1875. Na'im; and many distant, and in some cases murderous, raids were executed, especially by the former, who were assisted by their allies the Manasir and Bani Hajir Bedouins. In January 200 mounted Manasir and Bani Hajir made an attack on the Na'aimi town of Dhank in Dhahirah; and about the same time a similar force of Manasir and Mazari' made an unsuccessful expedition against Baraimi. The Bani Qitab, finding themselves in danger from the Bedouin allies of Abu Dhabi, applied for protection to the Shaikh of Dibai, who went out with a force of camelry and stood guard over them until satisfactory assurances had been received from Shaikh Zaid. In May 1887 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi went to war with some of the Dhawahir 1887-89. of Baraimi who opposed the extension of his influence to that place. The Sultan of 'Oman, Saiyid Turki, sent assistance in money and ammunition to the recalcitrant Dhawahir; but the consignment arrived too late. Within a month of his departure Shaikh Zaid returned home victorious, bringing two Shaikhs of the Dhawahir back with him as prisoners. In April 1889 the Shaikh of 'Ajman went to Baraimi and composed come disputes which had arisen there among the Na'im. In April 1891 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi marched to Baraimi, where he was 1891. joined by the Shaikh of Dibai with 30 horsemen and 300 camelmen and apparently engaged in hostilities with the Dhawahir, for his principal operation was the storm and capture of the village of 'Ain. Peace was now established between Shaikh Zaid and the A1 Bu Kharaiban Na'im of Baraimi ; and the Shaikh even took to wife a daughter of the Na'aimi holder of the Baraimi forts. The Bani Qitab and the Bani Ka'ab, formerly reckoned dependents of the Qawasim, now attached themselves to the interest of Abu Dhabi; and in June 1891 the Shaikh, being then on a visit to Masqat, persuaded the Sultan to restore some allowances which he had been accustomed to pay through his Wali of Sohar to the Na'im and Bani Qitab tribes but had suspended. When by these and by other similar means he had established a considerable 1897-1907. degree of influence over Baraimi, Shaikh Zaid proceeded to adopt more open and unmistakable measures for the virtual annexation of the Oasis. About 1897, or possibly earlier, he appropriated or reclaimed the estate of Jahali on the south western border of the cultivated area; and since then divers pieces of land and sundry water channels in Baraimi or its environs have been purchased by Shaikh 48533 N 286 Zaid and his sons, especially by his eldest son, Khalifah, who has recently founded a new settlement, Mas'udi, on the north-western edge of the Oasis. In 1904, a year in which Shaikh Zaid spent several months at his estate of Jahali, hostilities nearly arose from the purchase by Shaikh Khalifah of a share in an old disused Falaj, belonging to Ghaliris, at Baraimi; for, on some of the co-owners objecting to the intrusion of the Hinawi Bani Yas, Shaikh Zaid at first prepared to enforce his son's right by arms. At a meeting held at Samaih near Khor-al-Ghanadhah, however, he was induced, by the advice of the Shaikhs of Dibai and 'Ajman and of his friend Muhammad, the chief Na'aimi Shaikh of Baraimi, to abandon forcible measures. About the same time he proved the strength of his influence in the Baraimi neighbourhood generally by obliging the Bani Qitab to pay blood money for two citizens of 'Ibri town in Dhahirah, whom they had slain. General After the attack on Abu Dhabi town in 1856 the internal history of the matters, principality was, apart from the affairs of 'Odaid and Baraimi described above, 1857-1907. wholly uneventful. The wars of the Bani Yas with the A1 Thani Shaikhs of Dohah will be more appropriately related, though the interior of the Abu Dhabi Shaikh- dom did not entirely escape their effects, in the history of the Qatar promontory. Shaikh Zaid performed the Hajj in 1880-81, and in 1904 he received a fine mare with trappings from the Sharif of Makkah. ANNEXURE No. 3.—INTERNAL HISTORY OF THE DIBAI PRINCIPALITY. [pp. 772-775] Of the early history of Dibai town little is known. It existed already in 1799; and in 1825, as appears from the general history of Trucial 'Oman,* its possession was an object of ambition to the ruler of Masqat. Notwithstanding the separate signature on behalf of its chief Hazza'-bin-Za'al, then a minor, of the General Treaty of Peace in 1820, Dibai appears to have existed until 1833 as a dependency of the Abu Dhabi Shaikhdom; but in that year, as related elsewhere,t on the arrival of a body of 800 seceders from Abu Dhabi belonging to the A1 Bu Falasah section of the Bani Yas tribe, it attained indisputably to the status of a separate principality. Shaikh Maktum-bin-Buti, 1833-52. Accession of Shaikh Maktiim to sole power 1836. Administra tion and character. The leaders of the exodus of the A1 Bu Falasah from Abu Dhabi were Obaid-bin-Sa'id and Maktum-bin-Buti, who seem, according to a practice common among the Bani Yas, to have been recognised as joint chiefs; but on the death on the 9th of June 1836 of 'Obaid, who was regarded as the senior of the two, the undivided power devolved upon Maktum, at that time a haughty and inexperienced youth. The new principality was exposed for a time to considerable danger, both from the jealousy of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the former suzerain of Dibai, and from the ambition of the Qasimi Shaikh of Sharjah, between whom a combination was more than once formed for its suppression; but the personal courage and the ability of Shaikh Maktum were equal to every emergency, enabling him to play off with success the one enemy against the other; and it is probable that the peril from outside was not without advantage in strengthening his authority at home. The internal history of Dibai under Shaikh Maktum was in any case singularly uneventful, but in 1843 he lost an eye in battle with the Ghafalah Bedouins. As has often happened in the case of an Arab ruler refractory at the beginning of his reign in his relations with the British Government, Shaikh Maktum showed in later life a sincere appreciation of the objects and advantages of British policy in the Gulf; and he ultimately acquired, in a high degree, the confidence and respect of the local British authorities. * Vide page 686 ante. [See p. 37 of these Extracts.] t Vide page 765 ante. [See p. 81 of these Extracts.]87 Shaikh Maktimi fell a victim to sniall-pox in the spring of 1852. He died at Death of sea on a voyage to Qishm from Masqat, where he had gone to visit his ally Shaikh Saiyid Sa'id, probably in connection with recent events in Batinah. Maktum, Shaikh Sa'id-bin-Buti, 1852-59. Shaikh Maktum was succeeded by his brother, Shaikh Sa'id, but the position Rebellion of the latter, though his accession was peaceful, was challenged by Hashar and against Suhail, sons of Maktum; and, on his imprudently leaving Dibai to visit Saiyid Sa'id c h i kh ioc9 at Masqat in October 1852, the fort of Dibai passed by treachery into their hands. ai ' The governor appointed by Shaikh Sa'id at his departure,—one Sa'ld-bin-Rashid, his own maternal uncle—was at first imprisoned, but soon again released by the usurping chiefs; and, before the return of the Shaikh, this individual succeeded in justifying the confidence reposed in him by measures which resulted in the flight of Hashar and Suhail from Dibai. The cause of the exiles was espoused by the Shaikh of Sharjah, with whom they sought an asylum, and by whom a certain Sa'id-bin- Ma'anah was induced to leave Dibai with others of the A1 Bu Mahair tribe and to settle at Sharjah; but the evil went no further. Shaikh Sa'id was able on the 17th of December 1852 to conclude an offensive and defensive alliance with the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Umm-al-Qaiwain by which the intrigues of the Qasimi chief were effectually nullified. No further internal incident distinguished the Shaikhship of Shaikh Sa'id, and, Administra- like his predecessor in his later years, he was careful to cultivate a good under- tion ' charac- standing with the British Government: thus he was the only one of the leading ^shaikh Shaikhs of the coast who was not in attendance at Baraimi on the son of the sa'id. 1 Wahhabi Amir when the Resident arrived in 1853 to arrange the Perpetual Treaty of Peace. Shaikh Sa'id died in December 1859 of small-pox, a disease to which his family seem to have been unusually susceptible, for another brother and a nephew now also succumbed to the same malady, which, as will be recollected, had carried off his brother Maktum. Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, 1859-86. Shaikh Sa'id was followed in the Shaikhship by his nephew and former rival, Hashar-bin-Maktum, who on his accession wrote to the British Political Resident professing friendship and a desire to fulfil his obligations towards the British Government; nor did the attitude of the new chief, in a case of serious outrage at sea committed by the A1 Bu Falasah immediately before his elevation to the chiefship, belie his fair words. Shaikh Hashar died on the 22nd of November 1886, and the succession was claimed by his brother Rashid and by his son Maktum, whose supporters were approximately equal in number and influence. Shaikh Rashid-bin-Maktum, 1886-94. The dispute as to the succession having been peacefully settled by the elders of the tribe in favour of Rashid, the latter was recognised as Shaikh by the British Political Resident. In 1892, as mentioned in the general history of Trucial Oman, the conduct of this chief was not entirely satisfactory; his treatment of British subjects gave rise to complaints; and it became necessary to visit him with a penalty for having violated the Perpetual Treaty of Peace. In September of that year he paid a visit to Masqat, returning by Baraimi and forming on the way a matrimonial alliance with the A1 Bu Shamis division of the Na'im tribe. In December 1892 he became seriously ill; his indisposition at first attributed to poison, was subsequently described as a paralytic seizure. He eventually died on the 7th of April 1894. Shaikh Maktum -bin-Hashar, 1894-1906. The place of Shaikh Rashid was taken, on his death, by his nephew and original competitor, Maktum-bin-Hashar. The sons of the deceased Rashid at once formed a conspiracy against their cousin; but Shaikh Maktum seized them and imprisoned them for five months, after which they were released and took up their residence at Sharjah on small compassionate allowances granted by the Qasimi Shaikh.88 The subsequent policy of Shaikh Maktum was liberal and enlightened and resulted in the rapid growth of the port of Dibai, which after 1902, assisted by the decadence of Lingeh, became a regular place of call for steamers and the chief commercial emporium of the Trucial Coast. The relations of the Shaikh with the British political authorities were always excellent, chiefly on account of the reasonableness of his disposition; and his sudden death on the 16th of February 1906, apparently from heart disease, was much regretted. Shaikh Buti-bin-Suhail, from 1906. On the death of Shaikh Maktum, leaving no son who had reached man's estate, the government of Dibai was assumed without opposition by his cousin Buti-bin-Suhail, an elderly man. The new Shaikh was reported to be somewhat uncouth and less civilised than his predecessor. ANNEXURE No. 4.—INTERNAL HISTORY OF THE UMM-AL-QAIWAIN PRINCIPALITY. [pp. 775-6] The principality of Umm-al-Qaiwain, though it has played a not inconsiderable part among the petty states of Trucial 'Oman, it almost devoid of anything that can be described as internal history. This circumstance may be due in part to the longevity of the ruling family, belonging to the A1 'AH tribe, of whom three—a father and two sons—between them governed Umm-al-Qaiwain for nearly a century. These first of these, 'Abdullah-bin-Rashid, must have succeeded before 1820, in which year he personally subscribed the General Treaty of Peace; and in 1853 he still lived to accept, on behalf of his Shaikhdom, the Perpetual Treaty of Peace which was then executed. The year of his death is not known. In 1873 Umm-al-Qaiwain was governed by his son. Ah mad-bin-AMullah, who had in the meantime succeeded an elder brother named 'Ali. Ahmad married a sister of Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz, ruler of 'Ajman, of whom his eldest son, Rashid, was born about 1876. Another wife was a sister of Shaikh Hamaid, Qasimi, of Ras-al- Khaimah; but her he divorced in 1882. Shaikh Ahmad died on the 13th of June 1904 at an advanced age, apparently of paralysis; his health had been failing for some time previously, and infirmity prevented him from attending in person the Viceregal Darbar held off Sharjah in November 1903. Shaikh Rashid, who succeeded his father without opposition, and who in September 1904 wrote to the British Political Resident announcing his peaceful accession and accepting without reserve the existing treaties, appeared to possess ability and force of character; and, though somewhat headstrong, he was reported to be a satisfactory man with whom to deal. Soon after his accession he married a daughter of his maternal uncle, the Shaikh of 'Ajman. ANNEXURE No. 5.—INTERNAL HISTORY OF THE 'AJMAN PRINCIPALITY. [pp. 776-7] The internal history of 'Ajman presents few points of interest or importance. The Shaikh of the principality in 1820 was Rashid-bin-Hamaid; he died in 1838 and was at first succeeded by his son Hamaid-bin-Rashid. In May 1841 Hamaid-bin-Rashid, who had married a daughter of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar of Sharjah, was displaced by his brother 'Abdul 'Aziz -bin-Rashid. This chief, having gained an entrance into the fort by stealth along with some of his slaves and being supported by the good will of the people, was able to maintain his 'Abdullah- bin-Rashid. from before 1820 till after 1853. Ahmad-bin- 'Abdullah, from before 1873 till 1904. Rashid-bin- Ahmad, from 1904 to the present time.

The self-effacement of Abdul Aziz was not of long duration, and he soon Abdul 'Aziz- appeared once more in the character of principal Shaikh. His good conduct in 184S bin-Rashid, in a matter affecting the maritime peace has been noticed elsewhere; but in tribal 1841 - 48 - politics he was an inconstant and unreliable factor; and in 1846 he deserted the Shaikhs of Dibai and Umm-al-Qaiwain, his allies, in their struggle for independence against Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. In September 1848, as noted in the general history of Trucial 'Oman. 'Abdul 'AzTz was killed in battle with the people of Hamriyah. ' 'Abdul 'Aziz was succeeded by his brother Hamaid, whom he had originally Hamaid-bin- displayed, and who also was wounded in the Hamriyah fight. The death of Hamaid R&amp;shi f occurred at some time before 1873. ' second period, 1848 till before 1873. Rashid-bin-Hamaid, the son of the last Shaikh, ruled 'Ajman in 1873 and Rashid-bin- continued to do so till April 1891, when he died and made way for his son Ham aid.from Hamaid-bin-Rashid. ^ before 1873 to 1891. Hamaid-bin-Rashid ruled from 1891, till the 8th of July 1900. On that day he Hamaid-bin- was murdered by his uncle, 'Abdul 'Aziz-bin-Hamaid, who then assumed 'the R a shid ' Shaikhship. No sympathy was felt for the victim, who had alienated the members 1891 - 1900 - of his own family by his failure to make them regular allowances out of the state revenue: indeed his removal was received with general approbation. 'Abdul 'Aziz immediately assured the British subjects resident at 'Ajman of Abdul'Aziz- his protection; nor was his coup d'etat either accompanied or followed by any bin - Hamaid ' general disturbances. The new Shaikh subsequently wrote to the Resident to seek from 1900 ' recognition by the British Government; but' tacit recognition had already been afforded, and it was not considered advisable to grant any of a more formal character. 'Abdul 'Aziz was a close personal friend of the ruling Shaikh of Sharjah. ANNEXURE No. 6.—HISTORY OF THE SHAMAILTYAH TRACT. [pp. 777-784] The Shamailiyah tract on the shores of the Gulf of 'Oman, which for historical purposes may be taken as extending from Dibah to Khor Kalba and as including both of those places,* has undergone within the last century so many external and internal political vicissitudes that its history cannot be conveniently related in connection with the affairs of any principality. A short separate notice of events in Shamailiyah is accordingly given below. Indeterminate political position of Shamaillyah, 1798-1850. About the end of the 18th century the northern part of Shamailiyah was The Qawasim evidently held, or at least claimed, by the Qawasim; for Saiyid Sultan of Masqat, on a rupture occurring between himself and the Qasimi Shaikh in or about 1798, made a naval attack on Dibah. The place appears to have been defended chiefly by the Sharqiyin and Naqbiyin tribes, who successfully frustrated the Saiyid's attempt but themselves suffered considerably in the operations. Several years later, as is more fully related in the history of the 'Oman Th e Qawasim Sultanate, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar of Ras-al-Khaimah obtained possession of J 1 , K L h _ or Khor Fakkan, the most central and one of the most important places on the igos an ' Shamailiyah coast; and a base for piratical expeditions was at once established there by the Qawasim. In 1808 Saiyid Sa'ld, the young ruler of Masqat, assisted by his uncle, Qais-bin-Ahmad of Sohar, and by a local chief Muhammad-bin- Matar of Fujairah, captured the new Qasimi stronghold at Khor Fakkan; but, before he had time to make good his success, he was suddenly defeated and expelled by a force under Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar. * The generalisation is faulty only in the inclusion of Dibah, which is situated just outside the district properly known as Shamailiyah.90 Occupation by the Wah- habis of Fujairah. Bithnah and khor Fakkan. 1809-10. Recovery by the Saiyid of Masqat of Dibah and Khor Fakkan (date uncertain). Seizure of all Shamailiyah by the Qasimi Shaikh, 1832. Recovery of central and southern Shamailiyah by the ruler of Masqat (date uncertain). Final annex ation of Shamailiyah to the Sharjah Shaikhdom, 1850 In the following year, about the time that they brought the Pirate Coast and its hinterland under their direct control, the Wahhabis appear to have occupied the forts of Fujairah, Bithnah and Khor Fakkan in Shamailiyah with troops or adherents of their own; and simultaneously they seized the adjacent town of Shinas in Batinah, which belonged to Masqat. At the beginning of 1810 Shinas was recaptured from the Wahhabis by a joint British and 'Omam expedition; but the operation was so little profitable to Saiyid Sa id, for whose benefit it was undertaken, that the reduction of Khor Fakkan, though previously resolved on, was not attempted. The Wahhabis, therefore, presumably remained in full possession of Shamailiyah. . . i. r i ^ , At some time after these events, possibly as an indirect result of the British expedition to Ras-al-Khaimah and the humiliation of the Qawasim in 1819-20, the ruler of Masqat must have regained possession of the whole of Shamailiyah*; for in 1831 we find the Qasimi Shaikh, Sultan-bin-Saqar, bargaining with Sa'id of Masqat for the cession to himself, as the price of his co-operation with the Saiyid in an attempt upon Sohar, of either Dibah or Khor Fakkan. In the following year, 1832, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar profited by the absence of Saiyid Sa'id in East Africa and a consequent rising against his authority in 'Oman to seize Dibah, Khor Fakkan and Ghallah and so to bring the whole of Shamailiyah into subjection to himself; his success upon this occasion has sometimes been wrongly described as the final annexation of Shamailiyah to the Sharjah principality. In 1835 Shaikh Suitan -bin-Saqar proceeded with a Qasimi fleet to Dibah and Khor Fakkan, and complaints of piratical outrages upon Masqati and other vessels which soon began to reach the British authorities necessitated action by the latter, as is related in another place. Again, after an interval, Khor Fakkan and Ghallah, with—it may safely be assumed—the coast between these two places, returned into the possession of the Saiyid of Masqat; but nothing is ascertainable in regard to the time or manner of this revolution. The Shaikh of Sharjah had not, however, abandoned his claim to the whole district; and in 1849 he was only restrained by the advice of friends from an expedition for its recovery. The end of these alternations between 'Omani and Qasimi ownership came in 1850, when, on an invitation from Qais-bin-'Azzan of Sohar, Shaikh Sultan-bin- Saqar hastened to his assistance, with the result that Shinas in Batinah as well as Ghallah and Khor Fakkan in Shamailiyah fell into the hands of the allies and were divided between them, the Qasimi Shaikh doubtless retaining the two Shamailiyah ports In 1851, on the arrival of Saiyid Sa'id in person. Shaikh Sultan withdrew his support from Saiyid Qais, whom Saiyid Sa'id then easily expelled not only from Shinas but also from Sohar. The whole of Shamailiyah, however, remained m possession of the Shaikh of Sharjah, whose neutrality, it seems not unnatural to suppose, may have been secured by an undertaking on the part of Saiyid Sa'id to maintain the status quo in this respect. Shamailiyah under Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, 1850-1866. Rising of the The only event of importance which occurred in Shamailiyah between the final Shi huh near annexation of that district to Sharjah and the death of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar was Dibah, 1855. a r j s j n g ; j n 0 f t he Shihuh in the neighbourhood of Dibah. Mashan, son ot Shaikh Ibrahim of Ras-al-Khaimah and grandson of Shaikh Sultan himself, having been appointed ruler over Dibah, immediately put forth his hand to oppress the neighbouring Shihuh, probably those of Bai'ah, and was waylaid and murdered in consequence by members of that tribe on a journey from Dibah to Ras -al-Khaimah. This extreme step, which was not taken by the Shihuh until their appeals to Shaikns Sultan and Ibrahim against Mashari had been rejected, led to a general war between the Qawasim and the Shihhi tribe which is described in the history of Ruus-al-Jibal. Shamailiyah under Shaikh Khalid-bin-Sultan, 1866-1868. Revolt in On the death of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar and the accession of his son Khahd Shamailiyah, in 1866, the headman of the village of Fujairah in Shamailiyah, one Abdullali-nin- 1866.

There is reason to think that the wnoie * It should be noted, however, that the troops of the Saiyid had intermediately been in possession of Khor Fakkan and had been again ejected in 1817.91 of Shamailiyah at this time rose in insurrection and that it was not recovered until after the death of Khalid; but this is a matter of conjecture rather than of certainty. Shamailiyah under Shaikh Salim-bin-Sultan, 1868-1883. Some time after this, Salim, the brother and successor of Khalid, sent a force to Dibah for the purpose of re-conquering all Shamaillyah, or so much of the district as was not at the time submissive to his authority; but the Sharqiyin, who had acquired a taste for independence, combined under the leadership of the headman of Fujairah to oppose the attempt and formed an alliance with the Shihuh under Salih-bin-Muhammad, Shaikh of Bai'ah, who were regarded as subjects ot Masqat. In the result the Qasimi force was besieged in Dibah by the Sharqiyin ana Shihuh; and Shaikh Salim, being unable to send reinforcements by land from Sharjah, as the passes through the hills were held by the Shihuh, deputed one of his brothers to make a friendly settlement. The mission was a success: the Sharqiyin submitted and promised to pay tribute. Not long afterwards, in consequence of the Shaikh of Sharjah's representative at Dibah having imprisoned twelve Sharqiyin of Gharaifah, another combination was formed between the Sharqiyin and the Shihuh, who closed the nearer passes; and the Qawasim were again besieged in Dibah. Shaikh Salim on this occasion sent 50 men with provisions and munitions of war by sea to Dibah; and some prisoners who had been taken were despatched by boat to Sharjah. On the arrival of H.M.S. ' Arab ' at Dibah the fighting there ceased; but in the meanwhile a force of 800 Qawasim had arrived from the direction of Shinas and taken a fort at Gharaifah, killing 36 and capturing 30 of the rebels. It was suspected that these troubles in Shamailiyah had been fomented in the interests of Masqat. In the spring of 1879 the people of Fujairah rose against and expelled one Sarur, who had been set in authority over them by the Shaikh of Sharjah, and replaced him by a certain Marzuq. At the same time they sent a deputation to Sharjah to inform the Shaikh of their proceedings but Shaikh Salim, instead of being appeased by this step, confined the members of the deputation, sent a land force against the fort of Fujairah, which was recaptured and garrisoned with Baluch, and even transported some prisoners to the island of Bu Musa. An allegation by the Fujairah malcontents that the Shaikh had attacked them by sea with the help of their outside enemies was clearly shown to be false. Upon this Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, the headman of Fujairah and apparently the most active of the insurgents, made his escape to Masqat, where he arrived in April, and invited the Sultan of 'Oman to take Fujairah for the future under his own protection. Discussions between the Sultan and the British authoiities followed, in which Saiyid Turki at first claimed sovereignty over Fujairah; but eventually he admitted the liability of the place to pay tribute to Sharjah and only argued against oppressive interference there by the Qasimi Shaikh in local matters. In this correspondence the curious fact was elicited that Saiyid Turki had in 1871 given a sealed document to the Shaikh of Sharjah containing an admission that the whole of the coast from Khor Kalba to Sharjah, with the single exception of Khasab, belonged to the Qawasim; but this agreement he now repudiated on the ground that it was executed before his accession to the Sultanate and that it was conditional upon the rendering of certain services by the Qasimi Shaikh which the latter had never performed. t ^ 11 . £ t ? • - u The Qawasim did not long remain in undisturbed possession or rujanah. A l the end of I879 or beginning of 1880 Hamad -bin-'Abdullah, having returned from Masqat by sea but in a peaceable manner, headed a fresh rising at Fujairah in w ic the Qasimi garrison were driven out of the fort with a loss of eight men killed. The question of disturbance of the maritime peace which arose in connection with Shamailiyah affairs in 1876 and again in 1880 is noticed,' being a matter o general importance, in the history of Trucial 'Oman. Here we are only concerned to observe that in 1881 the Shaikh of Sharjah having been discouraged m his original wish to undertake the recovery of Fujairah by sea tell back upon a second set of demands, viz., that he should be allowed by the British Government to operate by land, that he should be supported before Fujairah by a British man-of-war, and that the Sultan of 'Oman should be restrained from countenancing Hamad-bm- 'Abdullah- but the Political Resident, Colonel Ross, whom the Shaikh visited at Rebellion in Shamailiyah (date uncertain).

The dispute seems to have been ultimately settled in this manner, on a basis of submission by the chief of Fujairah to the chief of Sharjah as his suzerain, together with continued payment of customary tribute; and a written agreement was executed by Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, apparently in 1881, in which he admitted his dependence on the Shaikh of Sharjah. It was the opinion of Colonel Ross that the complete independence of Fujairah, which in the past had always been subject either to Sharjah or to Masqat, was an object that, in the general interest, ought not to be promoted.

Fresh revolt at Fujairah, 1900-01. At his accession to the Sharjah Shaikhdom in 1883 Saqar-bin-Khalid found the Shamailiyah district divided into two tiefs, one of which, adjoining Dibah, had been conferred by Shaikh Salim on his brother Ahmad, and the other, embracing Khor Fakkan, on his brother Majid: this arrangement Shaikh Saqar made no direct effort to change. But Shaikh Saqar, while he did not himself attempt to displace his kinsmen from their possessions, seems to have instigated that turbulent character, Hamad- bm-'Abdullah of Fujairah, to seize not only Gharaifah on the coast, but also the important hill fort of Bithnah in Wadi Ham, which commands the only direct route between Shamailiyah and the coast of Trucial 'Oman. The Fujairah headman waited for no second invitation, but attacked and took both places, besides plundering Zubarah, the inhabitants of which village had gone to the assistance of those of Bithnah. Instead, however, of holding these acquisitions at Shaikh Saqar's disposal, Hamad-bin-'Abdullah made overtures for protection to the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah; and the Shaikh of Sharjah, unwilling to offend that personage, who was his own near relation, remained quiescent. In June 1886 the Wali of Sohar reported to his master, Saiyid Turki of Masqat, that the people of Khor Fakkan, Dibah and the neighbourhood were anxious to be taken under the protection of the 'Oman Sultanate; and the Sultan requested the advice of Colonel Miles, formerly Political Agent at Masqat, who was now Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf. Colonel Miles replied that interference in Shamailiyah was inadvisable as it might lead to a conflict with the Qasimi Shaikh, with whom the Sultan was then at peace, and that it would probably in the end prove injurious to the interests of the Sultan himself. This answer, which was approved by the Government of India, was sufficient to convince Saiyid Turki of the desirability of abstention, and instructions in accordance with it were given by him to the Wali of Sohar. In 1893, at the instigation as was supposed of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, an attack was made by some of the Shihuh on the village of Hair in Shamailiyah, where they killed a number of the inhabitants and destroyed the fort. In the following year the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah would have rebuilt Hair; but the Shihuh interposed, and their obstruction was for the time successful. In 1896-97 a Qasimi was murdered at Fujairah, and the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al- Khaimah undertook an expedition against the place, which resulted in the payment of blood-money. At length in 1900 the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah died, and that place and its dependencies were re-absorbed in the Shaikhdom of Sharjah, governed by Saqar- bin-Khalid. Shamailiyah was still held in two fiefs, a northern and a southern, by Rashid-bin-Ahmad and Hamad-bin-Majid, the sons of the original grantees, of whom the latter derived a revenue worth about $2,000 per annum from Fujairah, including 150 skins of dates, 12 cwt. of wheat and $10 in cash. About the beginning of 1901 the Shaikh of Sharjah sent Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, the headman of Fujairan, to treat, as his representative, with the Shihuh in regard to a murder which had occurred at Dibah; but Hamad apparently profited by the occasion to form a private understanding with the Shihuh, and shortly afterwards he showed signs of disaffection. Negotiations followed, in which the Shaikh of Dibai took part; but they were inconclusive; and Ahmad-bin-Majid at Ghallah, distrusted by the headman of Fujairah and cut off from the assistance of his relation the Shaikh of Sharjah by the hill fort of Bithnah, was placed in a dangerous predicament.93 The combinations among the chiefs of Trucial 'Oman to which this crisis gave rise are described in the general history of that region. The reason, or at least the pretext, of the headman of Fujairah for his revolt was, as subsequently explained by himself, that Shaikh Saqar-bin-Sultan had in the first instance failed to obtain redress for the robbery of certain natives of Lingeh, residing at Fujairah, by 'Awamir and Bani Qitab Bedouins; and that, when Hamad in these circumstances had sought the good offices of the Shaikh of Dibai, the Shaikh of Sharjah, taking offence at his action, had employed the Mazari' and Jalajilah Bedouins to harass Fujairah and had obliged the Jalajilah to divert their trade from Fujairah to the port of Ghallah. In April 1902, Shaikh Saqar-bin-Khalid having asembled a body of 250 Intervention Bedouins for an attack on Fujairah, and a disposition having appeared on the of the Briti sh part of the Shaikhs of Dibai and 'Ajman to assist Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, the ^thSies attention of the British Resident, Colonel Kemball, was directed to the dispute '1902 with a view to its settlement. A visit was paid to Fujairah by Major Cox, then Political Agent at Masqat, before whom Hamad contended that the agreement executed by him in 1881 did not apply to his own village of Fujairah and seemed loth to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Shaikh of Sharjah in any shape or form; the Shaikh of Dibai was warned to desist from interference; and the Sultan of 'Oman, Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, was restrained from affording support which the headman of Fujairah had gone in person to Masqat in order to procure. Such was the position of affairs when Colonel Kemball directed the Residency Agent at Sharjah to take steps to assemble a board of conciliation. The Shaikh of Sharjah, though he declared his inability to restrain Bedouins from attacking Fujairah, was at this time willing to accept a general decision by the Resident between himsdf and Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, and he granted a safe-conduct to enable his adversary to appear at Sharjah. The headman of Fujairah, on the other hand, would agree to no such compromise; he declined to attend the meeting at Sharjah and was obviously resolved not to submit to any settlement; and it was suspected that he was encouraged in his purpose of resistance by the Shihuh of Bai'ah and even by the Wall of Sohar in the 'Oman Sultanate. In October 1902 Saiyid Turki of Masqat, at the instance of the British political authorities, sent orders to the Shihuh of Bai'ah to refrain from countenancing Hamad-bin-'Abdullah; but in the meantime Shaikh Saqar-bin-Khalid had repented of his own conciliatory attitude, and in November he caused two inhabitants of Fujairah to be murdered by the way as they were returning from 'Ajman to their homes. In December Mr. Gaskin, Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain, was sent to the spot in the R.I.M.S. ' Lawrence ' to effect an accommodation, if possible; Shaikh Saqar joined him on board at Sharjah on the 27th of December, and on the 28th the vessel reached the coast opposite Fujairah. Two days were spent in negotiations: but the demeanour on shore of Hamad-bin-'Abdullah's armed followers was almost threatening, and the attempt at mediation had to be abandoned. In these circumstances the Government of India decided that there was no need to interfere between the disputants, provided that it was clearly understood by both that the peace at sea must not be disturbed; and they were consequently left to pursue their own measures one against the other. In April 1903 the Shaikh of Sharjah sent an expedition against Fujairah which Further reached Bithnah; and it was reported that Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, though again events, 1903. assisted by the Shaikh of Bai'ah, had been obliged to sue for peace, to admit his vassalage, and to enter into a provisional agreement; but the settlement was nominal only and made no real change in the situation. In his address to the Trucial Shaikhs at the Darbar held at sea off Sharjah in November 1903, Lord Curzon referred to the Fujairah case and counselled an amicable agreement; but his exhortation fell on unheeding ears. Early in 1903, in connection with measures for securing the naval position of Recognition Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, it was decided by His Majesty's Government, of in accordance with recommendations by the Government of India, that the Shamailiyah Shamailiyah district from Dibah to Khor Kalba should be regarded as belonging to ^ the Britlsh the Shaikhdom of Sharjah. not as an independent principality nor as connected with the Sultanate of 'Oman.

Correspon dence with the Porte regarding Piracies committed from 'Odaid, 1877. Complaint by the Porte of British action at 'Odaid, 1878. In the course of some topographical and political inquiries which were held by the present writer on tour at Sohar in March 1905, a striking corroboration of the correctness of this view was obtained. By a crowded assembly which included the Sultan of 'Oman's Acting Wali of Sohar it was stated, without one dissentient voice, that the coast from Khor Kalba to Dibah, inclusive, belonged to the Shaikh of Sharjah. By 1905 the Shaikh of Sharjah had apparently abandoned ail hope of reducing the headman of Fujairah to obedience; and in that year it was ascertained that Hamad-bin-'Abdullah held adverse possession of the following places in addition to his own village of Fujairah;—Bithnah, Gharaifah, Marbah, Qaraiyah, Qidfah Saqamqam and Sufad. In April 1906, as mentioned* in the general history of Trucial 'Oman, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, in a written agreement between himself and the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, claimed the headman of Fujairah as amorF his own political dependents, and no protest was apparently entered by the Shaikh of Sharjah. Relations of Qatar with Abu Dhabi and affairs at 'Odaid, 1872-93. [pp. 818-22] The history of a colony of Bani Yas seceders at Khor-al-'Odaid, maintained from 1869 to 1878, will be found included in that of the Abu Dhabi principality,! within the territorial limits of which 'Odaid is situated; but the bearing of certain events there upon the history of Qatar, which the inlet closely adjoins, should be noted. In 1871, soon after the arrival of the Turks in Hasa, it appeared that the Turkish flag had been offered to the Bani Yas colonists at 'Odaid, but the latter, who professed themselves independent of all authority, were said not to have accepted it, though there was also a contradictory rumour that it was hoisted on Fridays. In 1873 four Turks visited 'Odaid and arranged that a sum of $40 or 50 should be paid annually by the settlers through Shaikh Jasim of Dohah, after which they went away, having been deterred by the inferior character of the water supply from establishing a post. In 1874 Shaikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi stated that local Turkish officials had written to him asserting Odaid to be under their protection, and calling on him to abstain from interference there; he was unable, however, to produce their letters when called upon to do so. In 1875 it was ascertained that the headman of Odaid had both a Trucial and a Turkish flag and that he used one or the other as occasion required. On the 18th of October 1876, when Captain Guthrie visited Odaid in the May Frere,'' he found the Trucial flag flyina but learned that tribute was still paid to Turkey. In 1876 and 1877 a number of piracies were committed by the A1 Morrah, a Bedouin tribe nominally dependent on Turkey, from boat harbours under 'Odaid; these proceedings the headman of 'Odaid was unable to prevent, and representa tions to the Turkish Government became necessary. Her Majesty's Government, while avoiding specific mention of 'Odaid, reference to which might have raised an inconvenient territorial question, drew the attention of the Porte to the increase ot piracy along the Qatar coast which had resulted from the extension of Turkish sovereignty in that direction, and intimated their own resolve not to allow the peace of the Persian Gull to be disturbed by marauders, whether proceeding from places like Dohah actually in Turkish possession, or belonging to tribes that admitted Turkish supremacy and sailing from the ports of independent chiefs too weak to prevent the abuse of their territory. The Turkish Government in reply denied all knowledge ot piratical outrages on the Qatar coast and asked for particulars. n - ^ ie P^toman Minister for Foreign Affairs complained of action by the British authorities at Odaid a few months previously, which, as related in the history of Abu Dhabi, had resulted in the abandonment of the place by the Bani Yas colonists; and in the Turkish communication 'Odaid was stated to be a dependency ol the Turkish district of Qatar. It does not appear from the records ot the Government of India what reply was made to this complaint; but, from the correspondence which shortly after took place in regard to piracies off the coast ot Hasa and Qatar, it seems clear that the British Government were resolved not to admit Turkish pretensions to jurisdiction at 'Odaid or at any place further to the eastward. * Vide page 754 ante. [See p. 74 of these Extracts.] I Vide page 763 ante. [See p. 80 of these Extracts.]95 From 1876 onwards, as a result of the presence of Bani Yas rebels at 'Odaid, Protracted hostile relations prevailed between the Shaikh of Dohah and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi; and in 1880, by the return of the Qubaisat to Abu Dhabi, the enmity of^hah S between the Shaikhs was much embittered. During the sojourn of the Qubaisat . dn ^ Abu at 'Odaid that place had fallen largely under the influence of Shaikh Jasim, to Dhabi, whom, by their removal, it was again lost; and his indignation was expressed in pecuniary claims which he now brought against their headman, Buti-bin-Khadim. In 1881 Jasim intimated to the Resident an intention on his part of occupying 1881. 'Odaid and seizing the person of Buti-bin-Khadim; but Colonel Ross was able to prevent him from attempting either enterprise. In December 1881 a raid was committed by Bani Hajir and other Bedouins from Qatar in the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi and a number of camels were carried off and sold at Dohah, where upon the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi immediately prepared to retaliate and Shaikh Jasim made dispositions for defence; but eventually, by the intervention of Muhammad-bin-'Abdul Wahhab, the matter was settled without fighting. In 1885, after an interval of peace. Shaikh Jasim re-opened his feud with Abu 1885. Dhabi, alleging that a debt due from Buti-bin-Khadim, for which Shaikh Zaid had become surety, had not been discharged; that the Manasir, who were protected by Shaikh Zaid, had plundered some natives of Qatar on Dalmah Island and had raided Qatar territory; and that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was interfering with 'Odaid, which belonged of right to Shaikh Jasim and which he intended to occupy. The complaint in regard to Manasir probably referred to the carrying off from Na'aijah near Dohah, by the A1 Bu Sha'ar section of that tribe, of some cattle and three female slaves belonging to Jasim dependents,—an act fc&gt;r which reprisals were at once made at Jasim's instance by the Bani Hajir and the A1 Morrah. These tribes made a foray on the Bani Yas country, carrying off six camels which found a market at Dohah, and recriminations between the two Shaikhs followed; but matters were once more temporarily adjusted by the agency of Nasir-bin-Mubarak, the Bahrain refugee. Meanwhile the Political Resident, in reply to a communica tion from Shaikh Jasim, had desired him to relinquish his intention of occupying 'Odaid and to send particulars of his claims against the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi with a view to a settlement; but with the latter invitation Shaikh Jasim did not see fit to comply. In the summer of 1886 Shaikh Jasim informed Shaikh Zaid that he had been 1886. directed by the Turkish authorities to rebuild 'Odaid, and he enclosed, as evidence of his statement, a letter from the commander of the Turkish vessel ' Zuhaf.' This correspondence was forwarded by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to the Political Resident, but in the meantime, apparently. Shaikh Jasim made a movement from Dohah in the direction of 'Odaid. The Resident, however, again warned him to desist from his proceedings and held a vessel of war in readiness to proceed to the spot, while a protest made to the Turkish authorities resultea in the disavowal and censure by the Wali of Basrah, in writing, of the action of the commander of the 'Zuhaf'; and accordingly no attempt to occupy 'Odaid was made by Shaikh Jasim In 1887 a piratical Baqarah from Wakrah attacked a boat of the Qubaisat 1887. Bani Yas on the pearl banks, and one of the crew of the latter was so severely wounded that he died. _ , ™ u- In 1888 the protracted war between the Shaikhs and Dohah and Abu Dhabi Death of a suddenly reached a crisis. In February of that year, the Wali of Basrah being then actually present in Dohah, a raid was committed at Na'aijah in the immediate jggg vicinity by Manasir camel riders, chiefly of the A1 Bu Sha'ar section, who carried away 40 male and female slaves; and some of the Manasir, advancing yet nearer, abducted two or three slaves from the very outskirts of Dohah. Pursuit was attempted, but was unsuccessful. In March, Jasim made a retaliatory raid into the district of Liwah in Dhafrah and carried off some 400 camels, which he divided amongst his followers; he also recovered, on this occasion, two of the slaves raided from Dohah; and he caused 20 Liwah villagers to be soundly thrashed. In May the tables were again turned by a raiding party of 250 Bedouins whom Shaikh Zaid despatched against Dohah under his son Khalilah; on their arrival before the place. Shaikh Jasim himself being then at Dha'ain, the townspeople turned out against them in scattered detachments, were drawn by a simulated flight into an ambush, and lost 34 men killed, among whom was Ali, a son of Jasim. Between rage and grief Shaikh Jasim was all but distraught; he incited the P ro sp e ct of Turks to invade Trucial 'Oman, he applied for help to Ibn-Rashid, he opened a an correspondence with the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman other than Shaikh Zaid, and96 Arabian interference in the war, 1888.

On Ibn-Rashid makina a favourable response to his overtures disturbances on a serious scale, and even an attack by Jasim and his allies upon Abu Dhabi, began to be apprehended by the British political authorities. The Turks, however, possibly on account of warning against interference which the Government of India asked might be conveyed to the Porte, did not move; Ibn-Rashid also remained inactive; and Shaikh Jasim's reprisals eventually took the shape of incursions into Liwah, in January and February 1889, in which date plantations were cut down and men, women, and children barbarously murdered. Shaikh Jasim also prohibited the subjects of the Shaikh of Dibai, who had now thrown in his lot with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, from landing in Qatar for trade or for any other purpose. In April the Bani Yas in their turn retaliated by an expedition to the distant region of Barr-al-Qarah, from which they carried away a large number of camels belonging to the Bedouin tribes that supported the Shaikh of Dohah. In June a counter-raid was made by Jasim's people in the direction of Abu Dhabi, from which they returned with camels taken from the Darn' and A1 Bu Shamis Na'Im. In August a number of the A1 Morrah transferred themselves to the side of Shaikh Zaid and promised to act with him against raiders from Qatar. In his eagerness to strike, Shaikh Jasim ventured upon one occasion to despatch armed men and ammunition by boat to Sila', a place on the coast considerably to the eastward of Khor-al-'Odaid and therefore under Abu Dhabi; for this act he was severely reprimanded by the Resident under the orders of the Government of India, an intimation being added that repetition of the offence would entail serious consequences. During the continuance of the war the Turkish garrison at Ddhah received orders to assist Shaikh Jasim in defending the town, if attacked; but they were prohibited from operating at a greater distance than 4 hours' march from Dohah. At the end of 1889 the Wali of Basrah tried to arrange a reconciliation and wrote a letter to Shaikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi, in which he exhorted him to submit to Turkish arbitration with a view to the avoidance of strife and bloodshed, and for the sake of the Muhammad an religion, common to the disputants, and of the ' latentsovereignty of the Sultan of Turkey over both, which other powers were seeking to deny. To this communication the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, advised by the Political Resident, replied that it was his own wish and intention, so long as the Shaikh of Ddhah abstained from aggressive movements, to confine himself to the government and protection of his own territories. In 1890 raids and counter-raids continued, the advantage on the whole resting with the Shaikh of Dohah; and in 1891 a raiding party from Qatar actually reached a point beyond Abu Dhabi town and succeeded in evading pursuit. In 1890-91, as already mentioned, there were rumours of an intention on the part of the Turks to post a Mudir at 'Odaid; but, though a Mudir designate actually arrived in Bahrain from Basrah at the end of 1890, they came to nothing. Operations of the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia, 1765-1803. [pp. 1056-7] Seriously occupied as the attention of the Wahhabis must have been in the littoral districts of the Red Sea, their energy and resources were at this time such as to permit of a simultaneous and hardly inferior display of activity along the whole Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, where their cause made considerable progress. During the period from 1793 to 1795, while the British Factory from Basrah was temporarily established at Kuwait, frequent demonstrations and one more or less serious attack were made upon the town by the Wahhabis, but here they gained no success: some details ot these hostilities are given in the history of the Kuwait principality. In regard to the nature of the relations subsisting between the British representatives at Kuwait and the Wahhabi Amir there is some doubt; for on the one hand it is stated that presents were regularly sent to the Amir, who in return* protected the British desert mail to Europe, and on the other it is alleged that the Factory once helped the people of Kuwait to repel a Wahhabi attack, According to Coransez (page 50) the Amir undertook to protect the British mail only so long as he should be at peace with the Pasha of Bachdad, but once put a man to death for tampering with it. ''after which 'Abdul 'Aziz showed unmistakable signs of resentment. In 1798-99, and again in 1802, Turkish expeditions against the Wahhabis marched, as will be shown further on, through Kuwait territory. The province of Hasa, reduced for the first time in 1792, was finally conquered by the Wahhabis in 1795, when it was placed under Wahhiibi governors and religious instructors. Hasa thus came to form a base in Eastern Arabia for the wider extension of Wahhabi influence; and a few years after, as we shall see in a later paragraph, it became the first battle-ground of the Wahhabi and the Turk. Established in Hasa, the Wahhabis soon began to exert an influence on Bahrain affairs; and it was largely through their aid that as related in the history of Bahrain, the 'Atbi rulers of the principality were able to prevent Saiyid Sultan of Masqat from obtaining a permanent footing in the islands. In 1803 Salman-bin-Ahmad, Shaikh of Bahrain, appears to have visited the Wahhabi Amir with a sum which he offered as tribute, but the payment was excused. It was also from Hasa that a Wahhabi force commanded by Hariq, a Nubian slave, proceeded to the Baraimi Oasis, which thev seized and occupied with a view to future action against Trucial 'Oman and the 'Oman Sultanate: the particulars of their operations on this side are given in the histories of the regions mentioned. By the middle of 1802 Wahhabi influence extended alona the whole coast from the neighbourhood of Kuwait to Dibah; and in 1803, in consequence of help lent by Saiyid Sultan of Masqat to their enemy the Sharif of Makkah, the Wahhabis declared war against 'Oman and, by compelling the TJtub of Kuwait and Bahrain and the Qawasim of Ras-al-Khaimah to take the sea against him, reduced the Saiyid to serious straits; but peace was made on condition that tribute of $12,000 a year should be paid by the ruler of Masqat to the Wahhabi Amir and that a Wahhabi political representative should be received by him at his capital. This peace was almost immediately violated by the Wahhabis, whose object seemed to be the complete subjection of 'Oman by an invasion; but news of the assassination of the Amir 'Abdul 'Aziz, received at the end of the year, obliged them to suspend their proceedings for a time. Meanwhile Saiyid Badar, who ultimately succeeded Saiyid Sultan at Masqat, had left 'Oman and joined himself to the Wahhabis. Proceedings of the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia, 1803-14. [/;/;. 1073-6] The details of the Wahhabi action in Eastern Arabia during the reign of Sa'ud will be found in the separate histories of the Arab principalities upon the coast of the Persian Gulf, chiefly in those of Bahrain, Trucial 'Oman and the 'Oman Sultanate; and here it will be enough to take a general view of the Wahhabi proceedings in that quarter. In 1808 the 'Utub of Kuwait, whose attitude towards the Wahhabi Amir had Action of the generally been one of defiance, withheld or refused to pay tribute; and a strong Wahhabis at Wahhabi force was despatched against the town, but was repulsed with loss. This Kuw ait. check to an enemy from whom he had much to fear was very welcome to the Pasha of Baghdad, who did not fail to show his pleasure by sending a robe of honour and other gifts to the Shaikh of Kuwait. In the following year the Wahhabi Amir, desirous of wiping out the defeat, ordered the 'Utub of Bahrain, the Qawasim of Ras-al-Khaimah and the Saiyid of Masqat to undertake an expedition by sea against Kuwait and Basrah; but the Qawasim alone expressed their willingness to obey, and even they in the end took no action. Sa'ud endeavoured, at the beginning of his reign, to consolidate the power Action of the obtained in his father's time over Bahrain and Qatar; and, so long as he remained Wahhabis in free from embarrassments in other quarters, his efforts were not unsuccessful. In Bahrain, ^ 1805, a dynastic quarrel being then in progress in 'Oman, he was able to despatch an an 'Atbi fleet from Bahrain to watch the course of events at Masqat in the Wahhabi interest. In 1809 he won over to his side the dangerous pirate Rahmah-bin-Jabir, with whose assistance his power was quickly established in Qatar; and in 1810 he was able to appoint a Wahhabi governor over Qatar, Bahrain and Hasa with headquarters in Bahrain. In 1811, in consequence of the dangers threatening from the direction of Egypt and Hijaz, he was obliged to relax his hold on the newly acquired eastern districts; Zubarah in Qatar was successfully attacked by the ruler oi Masqat; and the Wahhabi garrisons were either expelled or withdrawn from that place and from Bahrain, and were withdrawn from Qatif and Hofuf in Hasa, By Wahhabi conquest of Hasa, 1795.

Action of the Wahhabis in the 'Oman Sultanate. 1814 the influence of the Wahhabis in Bahrain affairs had ceased; but in Hasa, where there was no strong local power to contest the field, it remained paramount. The establishment of a Wahhabi post in the Baraimi Oasis in 1800 did not long remain without effect on the affairs of the district known at the present day as Trucial 'Oman, and in 1804 05 there was a marked increase of lawlessness on the part of the piratical Qawasim; but whether this was due to the direct incitement of the Wahhabis, or was an indirect result of their interference in local politics, must be considered a doubtful point. At the end of 1808 Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar, the chief of the Qawasim, was deposed by the Wahhabis from his general authority over the tribe; and in 1809 Husain-bin-'Ali, Shaikh of Rams, who had recently visited Dara'iyah, was appointed governor, on behalf of the Wahhabis, over the whole Pirate Coast. In 1808-09 a serious renewal of piracy took place and symptons of fanaticism were perceptible, but conclusive proofs of Wahhabi instigation were still wanting; it was stated, however, that Husain-bin-'Ali had undertaken the usual obligation of a Wahhabi governor to forward to Dara'iyah one-fifth of the spoils taken in war from k ' heretics ' by those over whom he was placed. In 1809 the Wahhabis consolidated their hold upon the 'Oman promontory by occupying with Wahhabi garrisons the forts of Fujairah, Bithnah and Khor Fakkan in Shamaillyah, and in the same year they succeeded in decoying Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar to Dara'iyah, where he was detained under surveillance; but the Shaikh before long escaped from their custody and made his way through Yaman to the port of Mokha, whence he returned by sea to Masqat. At the end of the year, when the piratical port of Ras-al-IChaimah was attacked by a British armament, it was stated that Mutlaq. the Wahhabi leader at Baraimi, had moved to the assistance of the Qawasim; but, if he did, he arrived too late. In 1812 piracy again revived upon the coast subject to the Qawasim; but the connection ot the Wahhabis with the outbreak, if they had any, was not clear. We have already averted to the interference of the Wahhabis in a dynastic quarrel at Masqat in the year 1805. The result of the struggle there was favourable to the Wahhabi protege Saiyid Badar, who obtained the chief power and ruled Masqat from 1805 to 1807; but in the latter year he was assassinated by his cousin Saiyid Sa'id, Wahhabi influence at Masqat received a severe check, and a garrison which the Wahhabis had placed at Barkah fled from their post. The new sovereign, Saiyid Sa'id, professed a favourable disposition towards Ibn-Sa'ud, who continued to be represented at Masqat by a political agent and some religious emissaries; but the Wahhabis were perfectly well aware of the Saiyid s secret hostility to their influence; and in 1809, after Sa'id had evaded compliance with an order to proceed in the Wahhabi interest against Kuwait, the Wahhabi general Mutlaq-al-Mutain was sent to Buraimi with orders to organise and conduct a campaign against him. It was at this point that the British expedition against Ras-al-Khaimah took place, designed partly for the chastisement of the Qasimi pirates and partly for the relief of the ruler of Masqat from the Wahhabi danger; it ended early, in 1810, with the recovery of the Saiyid's town of Shinas from the grasp of the Wahhabis, by whom it had been seized; but the effect of the operations was temporary and in the end probably unfavourable to the interest of Masqat. In 1811 Mutlaq, nothing daunted, proceeded with his task of subjugating 'Oman; after an unsuccesslul blockade of Barkah and Matrah, he made himself master of Hisn Samail in the heart of the Saiyid's dominions; and, having placed a garrison in that fort, he withdrew again to Buraimi. In 1812 the Saiyid's subjects, aided by a Persian contingent, retook Hisn Samail; but this success was followed by a severe engagement in the neighbourhood of Izki, in which the 'Omanis and their allies were completely worsted. In the same year, or perhaps in 1813, the Wahhabis took a fearful revenge on Saiyid Sa'id; their forces, accompainied by Turki and Faisal, two sons of the Wahhabi Amir, devastated the districts of Masqat and Eastern Hajar; and they encamped for a time in Ja'alan, which they made a base for their destructive raids, and where they succeeded in permanently converting the Bani Bu 'Ali and the Bani Rasib, two important local tribes, to Wahhabism. They then returned, apparently without loss, to their principal post in the Baraimi Oasis. Later in 1813, Saiyid Sa'id having opened a correspondence with Tusun Pasha and undertaken to restore the displaced Shaikh of the Qawasim, the Wahhabi general Mutlaq invaded Batinah in irresistable force and extorted from the ruler ot Masqat a payment of $40,000. Mutlaq then proceeded to Najd; but, his successor Ibn-'Azdakah having been murdered, he quickly returned to 'Oman—only however to meet his death, in November 1813, at the hands of the Hajriyin. His place at Baraimi was taken by one Ibn-Mazru'.99 Proceedings of the Amir Turki in Eastern Arabia, 1824^34. [pp. 1094-6] Under Turki the Wahhabis regained for a time their former position of influence in Eastern Arabia, and by 1833 the whole coast of the Gulfs of 'Oman and Persia as far north as Qatif owned their sovereignty, or at least their suzerainty, and payed tribute. One of the first objects that i urki set himself to accomplish after his accession Wahhabi was the recovery of the province of Hasa, which had been retained by the Bani recon q ue st Khalid Shaikhs since their installation by the Egyptians in 1819. From 1824 to 1830 the contest remained undecided, but in the latter year, as related in the history of Hasa, the Bani Khalid finally succumbed to the forces of the Amir; in the conclusive battle, fought at Wabrah, the Wahhabis were led by Turki and'his son Faisal in person. In 1831, encouraged by the rebellion of Mashari, the Bani Khalid ventured to attack Hofuf and Qatif; but they were repulsed. Strong in possession of Hasa, the Amir in 1930 demanded tribute of the Wahhabi Shaikh of Bahrain; and in 1831 the Shaikh, fearing a combination between the relati ons with Saiyid of Masqat and the Wahhabis, of which there were symptoms, admitted the obligation to pay. The settlement, however, was far from being of a cordial or permanent character on either side; the Wahhabis on their part endeavoured to establish Bashir, a son of the pirate Rahmah-bin-Jabir, at Dammam as a check upon the 'Utub of Bahrain; and the Shaikh of those islands, as soon as he dared, which was not until 1833 after the departure of Bashir, repudiated his agreement and incited the Bani Khalid to annoy the Wahhabis in Hasa. There is some reason to think that the assassination of the Amir Turki by Mashari in 1834 was instigated by the Bahrain Shaikh, to whom it was at least highly agreeable, and by whom, before that event, war had been declared and the ports of Qatif and 'Oqair blockaded from the sea. No sooner was Turki firmly seated on the throne of Najd than the more restless Wahhabi among the chiefs of what is now Trucial 'Oman began to cultivate his good graces, influence especially the Shaikhs of Sharjah and 'Ajman. Tn 1825 the Qasimi Shaikh of i' Tr _ ucial Sharjah secretly professed great fear of the Wahhabis and solicited a promise of 1824^1834. British assistance in case a refusal by him to comply with the desires of the Amir should bring him into trouble; no assurance, however, was given; but the Shaikh was strongly advised by the British authorities to refrain from joining in any movement against the Saiyid of Masqat. The appearance of the Wahhabis on the coast of Hasa in 1830 gave rise to a fresh commotion in Trucial 'Oman, and their probable advent was anticipated with delight by the Shaikhs of 'Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain, who hoped with their help to throw off the suzerainty of the Qasimi Shaikh, while by the latter it was naturally regarded with apprehension. The Shaikh of Sharjah once more sought British support, of which no hope was held out to him; and the Shaikh of 'Ajman, perhaps remembering the days when Husain-bin-'Ali of Rams had lorded it over the country in the name of the Wahhabi Amir, begged Turki for a commission as Wahhabi agent. This last request was prudently refused by the Amir, on the ground that he could recognise no chiefs in 'Oman except the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Saiyid of Masqat only; but later he made the Shaikh of 'Ajman the medium of a friendly communication from himself to the British Government. Relations between the Wahhabi Amir and the Saiyid of Masqat were, owing Wahhabi to the great distance intervening between their frontiers, but slowly resumed. The relations_ with initiative seems to have been taken by the Saiyid, who in 1831 despatched an embassy sulta^Se 11 with presents to Riyadh to request the assistance of the Amir in reducing Bahrain, 1824-183 '4. a proceeding that Turki turned to his own advantage in order to extort submission and tribute from the Shaikh of Bahrain. In 1833 the direct pressure of the Wahhabis was felt once more in the 'Oman Sultanate, and in that year the ruler of Masqat was obliged to come to an understanding with the Wahhabi general, Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq, the principal terms of the settlement being that the Saiyid should pay $5,000 a year as Zakat or tribute to the Amir, and that either party should assist the other in suppressing rebellions among his subjects. The latter clause of the agreement was deemed imprudent by the British authorities; but the Saiyid assured them that he would be guided, in his observance of it, entirely by their wishes. 48533 p100 Relations of the Amir Khalid with Arab states, 1840 42. [p, 1106] Rdaiion 8 dealings of the Amir Khalid with other states in Arabia were slight, and 'Omai/ 1 ^ were P rac ti ca lly confined to Trucial 'Oman. Some of the chiefs of that region 1840-42. undoubtedly opened a correspondence with him, particularly the Shaikh of Sharjah, a letter from whom, relating to designs on Baraimi, was intercepted by the Na'lm of that oasis in 1841. In October of the same year Khalid appeared to be organising an expedition against Baraimi; but, if this was the case, he was prevented from undertaking it by the rebellion, already in progress, which ended in his expulsion from his dominions. Designs on Trucial 'Oman, 1842-43. [p. 1108\ However weak an Amir of the Wahhabis might be, it was considered necessary to his honour at this period that he should assert his claims to sovereignty over distant 'Oman; and this obligation 'Abdullah fulfilled by informing the Shaikhs of the Trucial coast that he intended to depute Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq to represent him at Baraimi. The Shaikhs of Baraimi, who were also addressed, openly alleged a connection with the British Government, which, they may have hoped, would deter the Amir from meddling with their oasis; but they were divided among themselves, and the secret correspondence of some among them with the Wahhabis had, it was believed, a different tenor. Relations with Turkey, and Egypt, 1843-65. Relations with Jabal Shammar, 1843-65. Relations of the Wahhabi Government with adjacent states in Arabia, etc., 1843-65. [pp. 1110-6] With peace and order prevailing at home and a revenue sufficient for the needs of Government, it was natural that the energies of the Wahhabi Amir should take an outward direction, and that the proceedings of the Wahhabis abroad should become more aggressive than they had been for a considerable time past. Some uncertainty overshadows the relations subsisting, during the earlier part of Faisal's reign, between his government and the governments of Turkey and Egypt. In 1851 the Amir was understood to pay tribute to the Porte; but accredited envoys of the Pasha of Egypt, were present in his camp, and the Wahhabi agent at Kuwait professedly supported Egyptian interests. In 1855, in correspondence with the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Amir asserted himself to be 'a dependent of the exalted Turkish Government' and stated that his differences with Muhammad 'Ali of Egypt had been due to the conflict in policy between that Pasha and the Porte. About 1860, in the course of discussions relating to Bahrain, the Amir Faisal again wrote, somewhat ambiguously, that ' in accordance with treaties between the Wahhabi Amir and the Sultan 'Abdul Majid, there are matters which everyone is precluded from meddling with, unless on special grounds.' These periodical declarations show that the Amir was not averse, when it suited his interest, to admit dependence on the Porte; and the Turks, on their part, clearly asserted their suzerainty over the Wahhabis. An illustration of the Turkish claims was afforded by a protest lodged by the Pasha of Baghdad in 1862, against the bombardment of Dammam in Hasa by British war-vessels in the previous year; for the place in question was described as lying within the territory of ' Faisal Bey, the Qaim-Maqam of Najd ' and as forming ' part of the hereditary dominions of the Sultan.' At the close of Faisal's reign, the tribute rendered by him to the Porte was merely nominal and seems to have been paid through the Sharif of Makkah. So long as 'Abdullah, the first Mahfudh, continued to rule Jabal Shammar, the loyalty of that province to the Wahhabi Amir remained unquestioned; and Faisal, on his return from Egypt, seems to have been assisted by his old dependent to recover his position in Najd. Talal, the son of 'Abdullah, married a daughterof Faisal and continued, until his death in 1867, to pay a yearly visit to Riyadh, where he was accustomed to deliver his tribute of horses in person. About 1848, however, Qaslm, which had hitherto been directly dependent upon the Wahhabi Amir, appears to have obtained the protection of the Shammar chief as a sort of intermediate overlord. About 1851, as we have seen, the Amir Faisal maintained an agent at Kuwait; Relations and it was ascertained that in 1863 his relations with that place were friendly, although no tribute was paid him by the Shaikh. 1843-65. When Faisal came to the throne of Najd, a contest between 'Abdullah and Relations Muhammad, the two rival Shaikhs of Bahrain, was in progress. The Amir availed ®';j hrain himself of their mutual opposition to assert his own authority; and, but for the 184J_65 - opposition of the British Government, who had determined to confine Wahhabi influence to the mainland, it is not improbable that he would have succeeded in reducing the Bahrain Shaikh to a position of strict dependence on himself. The Amir at first sided with the younger claimant, Muhammad-bin-Khallfah, 1843-44. who had lately been driven out by 'Abdullah-bin-Ah mad; and, when the latter was in his turn displaced, it was principally by a Wahhabi force that, early in 1844, he was deprived of the fort of Dammam, his last remaining possession, of which the Wahhabi Amir considered himself to be the rightful owner. For some time after this the Wahhabis, having achieved their principal object 1845-47. in the recovery of Dammam, remained quiescent; but in 1845, on Muhammad- bin-Khalifah becoming intractable and refusing to pay an annual tribute with arrears to which he had agreed on the fall of Dammam, 'Abdullah-bin-Sa'id, the Wahhabi governor of Qatif, began to arrange an attack on Bahrain, and Muhammad, anticipating his designs, placed the Wahhabi coast under blockade. An invasion of Bahrain from Hasa by a stratagem was then planned by the ex-Shaikh 'Abdullah and the Wahhabi governor of Qatif; but it miscarried, when on the point of execution, through the scheme of action becoming known in Bahrain. In 1846 two collisions between Wahhabi and Bahrain forces occurred on the mainland and each side was able to boast of one victory. At length, in August 1847, the Shaikh of Bahrain having been weakened by the desertion of some of the Bani Khalid from his side, terms were arranged whereby the Wahhabi Amir undertook to withdraw his active support from the ex-Shaikh, and the Shaikh in return engaged to pay $4,000 a year to the Wahhabis as Zakat. In 1850 relations between Shaikh Muhammad and the Amir Faisal again 1850-51. became strained, in consequence of the punishment by the Wahhabi ruler of one of his own envoys to whom the Shaikh had given a flattering welcome, and of a cold reception which Muhammad had subsequently accorded to a son of Sa'ad- bin-Mutlaq, the Wahhabi agent in Oman. In 1851 the Amir arrived in person in the neighbourhood of Qatar, seduced the inhabitants of the principal places in that promontory from their allegiance to Bahrain, and demanded an extravagant increase in the Bahrain tribute, of which payment had probably been withheld altogether. Muhammad thereupon blockaded the Hasa coast; but the prepara tions of the Wahhabis, who were now joined by the sons of the late ex-Shaikh, had assumed formidable proportions; and it is probable that the Shaikh was only saved from destruction by the appearance of a British squadron which the Resident sent for the protection of the islands. In July 1851 peace was again arranged by the efforts of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi; but secretly tension continued; and the Wahhabi Amir established the sons of the late ex-Shaikh of Bahrain at Dammam. After these events, particularly in 1855-56, some correspondence in regard 1855-56. to Bahrain took place between the Wahhabi Amir and the Bnshehr Political Residency; the Amir claimed the right to chastise at pleasure his dependent, the Shaikh of Bahrain; and the warning returned by the British representative under the authority of the Government of India, that no interference with Bahrain would be permitted, caused him intense irritation and dissatisfaction. In 1859 the Amir, who alleged, and perhaps not without truth, that the Shaikh 1859. of Bahrain was inciting the tribes of Hasa to hostile action against his subjects, having disregarded the warnings of the Resident and the presence of a British corvette off his coast, caused preparations to be made by his governor of Qatif, assisted by a son of the late ex-Shaikh of Bahrain, for a serious invasion ot the islands. A British squadron was then despatched to threaten Dammam; and, in the result, the enterprise collapsed, and the Wahhabi official even apologised to the British commander for his proceedings. This successful act of intervention greatly increased the bitterness of Faisal against the British Government and their representatives. 48533 p 2102 1861. Relations with Trucial 'Oman, 1843-65. 1845. 1848. 1850-51 1852-53. 1854-55. In 1861 the Shaikh of Bahrain assumed the offensive against the Wahhabi Amir without first consulting the British Resident. He blockaded the Wahhabi ports and sent six war vessels to cruise against Dammam; and only by most stringent measures, amounting to compulsion, could he be induced by his British advisers to discontinue his unwarrantable action. It was now clear, however, that tranquillity in Bahrain waters could only be restored by the removal of the sons of the late ex-Shaikh from Dammam; and this was accordingly effected, by British naval action, in November 1861. The dislodgment of these disturbers of the peace from their stronghold was reported to have been not altogether unpleasing to the local Wahhabi officials in Qatif, who could not themselves have done what was required without committing a breach of Arab hospitality. Incidentally we may remark that, but for the vigilance with which the independence of Bahrain was watched over by the British Government during this period, the principality might have become attached to Hasa and afterwards have passed with that province into the possession of the Turks. In Trucial 'Oman, during the whole of this period, the Wahhabis were extremely active. In July 1843 letters and messengers from the Amir reached the principal Shaikhs of that region, informing them that at the end of the hot weather the Wahhabi agent Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq would arrive with troops to subdue the country; and all the chiefs, except those of Dibai and the Baraimi Oasis, appear to have professed in reply their satisfaction at the prospect. Early in 1845 Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq appeared in Baraimi with a small force. He was, apparently, by no means confident of success; but the surrounding tribes at first displayed considerable enthusiasm for the Wahhabi cause, and he was encouraged to form designs of occupying Dhank and Dhaid, and even Zora upon the coast. His arrogance and extortions, however, quickly alienated and disgusted most of his supporters; and his direct communications with Najd were then cut, his messengers beaten and insulted, and complaints against him made to the Wahhabi Amir. At one time it appeared probable that Sa'ad would be visited with his master's displeasure; but, by one means or another, he succeeded in justifying his conduct and in retaining his post. A remittance of treasure which he made by sea to Hasa no doubt contributed to restore him to favour. In May 1848 the Baraimi forts were captured by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, assisted by the ruler of the Sohar principality and by the Na'im and Dhawahir tribes; and Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq, who had been absent when the attack began, took refuge with the Shaikh of Sharjah. Tribal jealousy then came into play, and the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman as a whole turned against the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi; but the latter defied the combination against him and continued to hold Baraimi until February 1849, when he voluntarily restored it to the Wahhabis at the intercession of an envoy sent by the Sharif of Makkah. In March 1850 the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, after communication with the regent of the Oman Sultanate, again attacked the Wahhabis in Baraimi, but this time he failed to make any impression; and an assault on the place, made in the following November by a combination of the Bani Yas, Qawassim and Na'im, was equally unsuccessful. In 1851 the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah formed an alliance against the Wahhabis; but nothing came of it. At the end of 1852 'Abdullah, the son of the Wahhabi Amir, arrived in Baraimi; but his proceedings there, as will be seen in the next section, had reference chiefly to the 'Oman Sultanate. I he chiefs of Trucial 'Oman, however, except the Shaikh of Dibai, who avoided waiting on him in person, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who did his best to dissuade him from aggression to the eastwards, visited Baraimi and fawned upon him in a servile manner. A certain Ahmad-as-Sadairi was appointed about this time to the Wahhabi agency in Baraimi, in succession to Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq. In 1854 this individual appeared to be exerting himself to restrain the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman from mutual aggressions and to curb the license of the Bedouins; but in 1855 his activities took a mischievous turn, and it was found that he was scheming to obtain possession of the seaboard village of Hamriyah. In 1865 the Wahhabis were represented at Baraimi by 1 urki-bin-Ahmad, probably a son of Ahmad-as-Sadairi, but his attention was directed chiefly to the affairs of the 'Oman Sultanate. In 1855, in correspondence with the British Resident at Bushehr, the Amir Faisal described his mission in Trucial 'Oman as that of a benefactor by whom the savage tribes of the interior were restrained from preying upon and slaughtering the helpless populations of the coast.103 The Wahhabi post m Baraimi was used as a base for extremely aggressive Relations action against the Sultanate ol Oman in 1845, in 1853, and again in 1865. with the 'Oman Sultanate, 1843-65. On his arrival in Trucial 'Oman in 1845, Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq demanded tribute, 1845. at the rate of $5,000 and $20,000 a year respectively, from the rulers of Sohar and Masqat, and, to enforce compliance, he ravaged the Batinah district and took iMajis, butchering the garrison; $5,000 was then paid him on account of Sohar and it was agreed that the question of the Masqat payment should be referred to Saiyid Sa'ld, who was absent in East Africa. The Wahhabi soon violated the truce that had been arranged; but the action of the British authorities in support of the regent of Masqat, Saiyid Thuwaini, obliged him in the end to be content with a total annual tribute of $5,000. A douceur of $2,000 was paid by Saiyid Thuwaini to Sa'ad-bin-Mutlaq in consideration of the settlement, and Majis was restored to the former owner. In 1853, during his sojourn in Baraimi, 'Abdullah, the heir-apparent to the 1853. Wahhabi Amirship, insisted that the Saiyid of Masqat should cede to him the town and district of Sohar and pay a greatly enhanced tribute for the remainder of his dominions: from the exorbitance of these demands it was believed that the Wahhabis merely sought a pretext for declaring war. Encouraged by British support, Saiyid Thuwaini prepared to defend Sohar; the Wahhabis abandoned their intention of invading Batinah; and the ultimate result was an agreement under which the Saiyid was to retain Sohar and pay an increased tribute of $12,000 a year for the whole 'Oman Sultanate. It was further arranged that the Wahhabi agent and the ruler of Masqat should mutually assist one another against all enemies, and in pursuance of this undertaking Saiyid Thuwaini, in the following year, was actually helped by the Wahhabis to coerce some refractory tribes in Batinah. The Wahhabi agent, after these transactions, paid a visit on his own account, probably in the capacity of tax-collector, to the district of 'Oman Proper in the interior. In 1864 the Wahhabis brought indirect pressure to bear on the Sultan of 1864-65. 'Oman—now Saiyid Thuwaini, who had succeeded his father Saiyid Sa'ld—by supporting a rebel, Saiyid 'Azzan-bin-Qais of Rustaq, against his authority; but the Sultan immediately sought the aid of the British Government, and the Political Resident in the Gulf, Colonel Pelly, was directed to report on the situation. In March 1865 Colonel Pelly paid a personal visit, which will be described later on, to the Wahhabi Amir in his capital of Riyadh; and there he ascertained that the intimidation of the Sultan had been ordered by the Amir himself, who regarded Saiyid Thuwaini with the utmost contempt and wished to enhance his annual tribute from $12,000 to $40,000. In April 1865, on his return to the Persian Gulf, Colonel Pelly proceeded to Masqat, where he learned that Saiyid Azzan had now definitely placed himself under the protection of the Wahhabis, and that the latter were demanding an increased tribute and were threatening an invasion of 'Oman. In these circumstances Colonel Pelly, whose name the Sultan had already in 1864 without proper authority proposed to the Amir as that of a mediator, wrote to his late host Faisal tendering his good offices for a settlement; but no notice was taken by the Wahhabi of this communication. In August 1865 Masqat was visited by the usual Wahhabi deputation, who demanded on this occasion four times the customary annual tribute; but, under British advice, the Sultan paid only the established amount, and stated that, with reference to the balance, he awaited the result of Colonel Pelly's offer of mediation. In the same month the Wahhabi agent at Baraimi, in response to an invitation by the disaffected Jannabah inhabitants of Sur, sent a Wahhabi contingent to that place; a fort occupied by a garrison on behalf of the Sultan was taken after two days' resistance, Suq Sur was plundered, and one British Indian subject was killed and another wounded. Saiyid Thuwaini then weakly submitted and paid two sums, aggregating $16,000, to the Wahhabis as the price of peace; but the British Government, as we shall see later, did not allow matters to remain in this position.104 Relations of the Wahhabis with 'Oman and 1 rucial 'Oman, 1865 71 [pp. 1126-8] Destruction The destruction by a British war-vessel of a tower erected in Zora by the Shaikh by a British of Sh . lr j ah5 who at this tim e was hand in glove with the Wahhabis, has been tower at Zora mentioned above in connection with the operations of 1866; and by this measure January ' the peace of the Trucial Coast, which the tower had endangered, was re-established. 1866. Death by Qn the 7th of April 1869 the Sadairi representative of the Wahhabi Amir in t V h 0l wfhhL Baraimi, having proceeded to Sharjah and involved himself there in the internal agent in intrigues and dissensions of the ruling Qasimi family, was shot dead in a broil which Baraimi, 7th arose in the town, and a number of his followers perished with him. April 1869. Capture of This event was short i y followed by the disappearance of the Wahhabis from the Wahhlibis Buraimi, which they had occupied, almost continuously, for nearly 70 years, by the Sultan Probably before the death of the Wahhabi agent at Sharjah a peremptory demand of 'Oman. for payment of tribute had been addressed to Saiyid 'Azzan-bin-Qais. who had 18th June, recently usurped the Sultanate of 'Oman, and a raid had been made by the 1869 - Wahhabis on Sohar; consequently, when the Na'lm of Baraimi, after the mishap to the agent, invited Saiyid 'Azzan to join them in expelling the Wahhabis from the Oasis, he complied—being a man of bold and decided character—without hesitation. On or about the 18th of June the Wahhabi garrison of Baraimi surrendered, after a trifling resistance, to 'Azzan's force of about 1,500 men; and the Saiyid, after installing a garrison and forming an alliance with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, returned in triumph to Masqat. Abortive pre- 'Abdullah-bin-Faisal was not inclined to submit tamely to the loss of Baraimi fhTwXhabi and ' with it ' of his whole position in Trucial 'Oman and 'Oman; but various Amir for the circumstances incapacitated him for effective action for its recovery. Early in 1870 recovery of 'Abdullah came down to Hasa, where he proceeded to collect a force; it was Baraimi. believed that large numbers of boats were being collected by his order along the 1869-70. coasts of Hasa and Qatar for an expedition to Trucial 'Oman and thence against Baraimi; and subsequently the Amir himself was reported to have reached 'Oqair. He was reminded, however, of his promise, given in 1866, not to commit aggressions upon Arab states having friendly relations with the British Government, and the overthrow by a British naval force of some usurping chiefs who had seized Bahrain served as a timely illustration of the dangers of a conflict with Britain, besides which he was aware that the invasion of Bahrain, committed as it had been from the coast of Hasa, might be laid to his charge by the British Government. A combination formed by the Shaikh of 'Abu Dhabi, the Amir's rebellious brother Sa'ud and Saiyid 'Azzan of Masqat greatly increased the difficulty of his task in 'Oman; and the dryness of the season had made water scarce upon the routes by land from Hasa to Baraimi. In April 1866, dispirited by these obstacles, 'Abdullah seems to have returned to his capital, where the intrigues of his own relations had become a source of danger. The loss of Baraimi illustrated the truth, exemplified on a larger scale by the Egyptian occupations of Najd in 1818-19, and 1838-40, and by the Turkish occupation of Qasim in 1905-07, that political paramountcy depends even in Arabia on the possession of sufficient material force at the place to be dominated, and that in the absence of such force it cannot long continue.EXTRACTS FROM VOLUME I, PART II107 Organisation and working of the pearl fisheries on the Arabian side. [pp. 2227-34] Having taken account of the physical data of the industry, we proceed to enquire into the manner in which it is organised and prosecuted. The persons actually connected with the fisheries may be divided into two classes, namely financiers and operatives. The money required to equip the pearl fleet for sea and to maintain the crews Financiers, while employed on boards is partly advanced from private means by those interested in the operations and partly borrowed from a special class called Musaqqams (plural, Musaqqamin). The Musaqqam is generally a man of substance, but some Musaqqams, who have not sufficient capital of their own, conduct their business by means of loans which they obtain for the season from wealthy Arab or Indian merchants at 10 to 25 per cent, interest. The manner in which the debts of operatives to financiers and of financiers to capitalists are adjusted will be described further on, but the different forms of contract prevalent among them are too numerous and too complicated to be detailed. Formerly the hold of the Musaqqam class upon the industry was very strong, and many boats were fitted out with their assistance; but their position is no longer what it was, and their numbers are dwindling. In Bahrain, it is said, there are now only 3 Musaqqams (2 Baharinah and 1 a Sunni Arab), and not more than 10 per cent, of the Bahrain fleet have dealings with them. Once even Indian merchants did not despise the profession of Musaqqam. The general term for the pearl fishery is Ghaus (literally 'diving'), and all Classes of the classes that take part in the active operations are included under the common 0 P eratlves - denomination of Ghawawis (singular, Ghawwas). The unit of organisation is the boat's crew, and within this unit the chief personage is the Nakhuda (plural, Nawakhidah) or captain, in whom full authority and entire responsibility are vested. The Nakhuda is, in 7 or 8 cases out of 10, the owner of the boat which he commands; but sometimes he is the hirer of the boat, or again he may be merely an employe of the boat owner. Next in importance to the Nakhuda are the Ghasah (singular, Ghais) or ' Divers,' followed by the Siyub (singular, Saib) or ' Haulers.' One or more Radhafah (singular, Radhif) or extra hands are generally carried to assist the haulers, and sometimes a Walaid (plural, Aulad) or apprentice is taken, whose duty it is to catch fish, cook, look after the pipes and coffee, and attend to other minor duties. The Ghasah, whose only work is to dive, are mostly poor Arabs and free negroes or negro slaves; but Persians and Baluchis are also to be found among them, and, in recent years, owing to the large profits made by divers, many respectable Arabs have joined their ranks. The efficiency of a diver depends more on his skill and daring than on the strength of his constitution,—the last being a point on which undue stress has sometimes been laid by writers upon pearling; and a slave divei who is not afraid to enter deep and muddy water containing weeds is ordinarily valued at considerably over Rs. 1,000. The Siyub, whose duties are merely to manage the boat and to lower and pull up the divers, are usually landsmen oi ex-divers whom age or other causes have obliged to abandon diving. The total crew of a pearl boat varies from 10 to 40 men, the average number being about 16 for the whole Gulf. The number of the Ghasah is generally less than that of the regular Siyub in the same boat, standing to it in a proportion o 10 to 11, 12 or even more; the reason of this arrangement is that, if a diver were o be thrown out of work for want of a hauler, the loss would be greater than me expense of carrying a few extra Siyub. These extra Siyub, who must no e confounded with the Radhafah, are called Jalalis or ' Sitters (smguiar Jallas) All sorts of boats are now used for pearling, even jolly-boats being m these days fitted out for the purpose, but the majority are Sambuks; and after e h come, in order of frequency, Batlls, Baqarahs and Shu ais. A pear ° fi , largest dimensions, to carry 40 men, costs Rs. 30,000 or more to c °^ s ^ c , con duct Seasons. There were formerly, and are still, two recognised seasons ^ the conduct of pearling operations at sea; but their incidence has changed in tt r c Thirty years ago the earlier season was the Ghaus-al-Bard or which began at the middle of April and continued for the mldness of Ghaus-al-Bard the operations were confined to shallow v/ater, the sea, obliged the divers to work in alternate half-hour shitts. ^1^ the The next, which has always been the principal season and is ca 1 ^ Ghaus-al-Kabir or ' Great Diving ', formerly began in . middle of Shamal and lasted till the end of September; now, however, it g 48533 Q -P Boats.108 May and continues for 130 days, that is until about the middle of September; the beginning of this season is known as the Rakbah, and the end as the Quffal or ' Closing.' The times of beginning and ending of the Ghaus-al-Kabir are not exactly fixed, and they are liable to be affected by the month of Ramadhan, when it falls in the hot weather, as diving is prohibited during the fast. In 1906 the Ghaus-al-Kabir of the Bahrain fleet lasted from the 16th of May to the 18th of September, with an interval of 5 days which began on the 22nd of August. The second season is now the Raddah or ' Return,' which commences a few days after the conclusion of the Ghaus-al-Kabir and is of about 3 weeks' duration. In 1906 the Raddah of the Bahrain fleet began on the 20th of September and ended on the 14th of October; and in that year the Bahrain and Kuwait fleets closed the season about the same time,—later than the Qatar fleet, but earlier than that of Trucial 'Oman, which had delayed in putting to sea at the beginning of the season. Besides the seasons of pearling at sea, there is also a winter season for shore operations known as the Mujannah. In the Mujannah the fishery is conducted chiefly by wading in the shallows along the coast when the tide is out, and those who take part in it ordinarily return to their homes at night. The pearls obtained in the Mujannah are ordinarily small and discoloured; nevertheless the magnificent specimen which gave rise to a dispute mentioned further on in the political history of the pearl fisheries was found by a wader of Kumzar. It may be noted here that a number of Kuwait, Bahrain and Trucial 'Oman pearlers now visit the Ceylon banks in winter, instead of devoting themselves to ordinary deep-sea fishing at home, as was formerly the rule; the Government records do not show this practice to have prevailed earlier than 1889. Large boats in the Persian Gulf belonging to enterprising owners are sometimes sent away from the home fisheries to those of Soqotrah and the Red Sea, where they remain continuously for as much as two consecutive seasons, and return with Zanni and Sadaifi shells as well as pearls. This seems to be an old custom, and the season of 1885 is recorded as having been a successful one in the Red Sea; but, since the Italian Government began to tax pearl boats fishing in Eritrean waters, the Red Sea venture has become less popular than it formerly was. Modus The pearl fishers, who till recently had neither charts nor compasses but are operandi. now generally provided with the latter, are extremely expert in finding their way to any bank they may desire to reach, and are generally able to make a direct voyage thither; they are guided, not only by the sun and stars and by bearings from the land when in sight, but also by the colour and depth of the sea and by the nature of the bottom. Some Nakhudas select the banks which most generally yield a fair return, and stay on them for the season; other commanders, of a more sanguine or less methodical temparament, remain on the move and change the scene of their operations every few days. In the choice of a bank the Nakhuda is limited by the powers of his divers; 8 fathoms is an ordinary depth, and 12 is perhaps the greatest at which work can be carried on without discomfort; boats with good divers, however, will work on banks carrying 14 fathoms. There are men who can negotiate 16 fathoms of water, but the strain at this depth is too great to be endured long, even by the strongest, and fatal accidents sometimes occur in working at such a level.* On the banks diving is carried on every day during fine weather; work begins an hour after sunrise and ceases an hour before sunset. The interval between the early morning prayer and the commencement of diving is spent by the crew in opening the oysters collected on the previous day. This is done with crooked knives called Mufallq (singular, Mufliqah) under the personal superintendence of the Nakhuda, who takes charge of the pearls as they are extracted, and registers their weights and descriptions at such intervals as he considers necessary. Of the shells, only the best—that is to say some 3 or 4 per cent, of the whole—are kept, and the remainder are returned to the sea along with the juvenile oysters,—the latter unopened but unlikely, it is believed, to survive a separation of 16 hours on the average from their native element. The process of opening the oysters is unpleasant, owing to the smell and to the insects which it sometimes attracts. The divers, before they commence operations for the day, are allowed a light meal of half a pound of dates and a few cups of coffee each. Once they have entered the water, work is continued without intermission until Dhuhr (in the * In Ceylon waters 9 fathoms is the ordinary limit of the local diver. Individuals are found who can manage from 11 to 15 fathoms; but they can only bring up what they happen to find near near them, and in the case of 15 fathoms they come up exhausted (see Professor Herdman's Report).109 pearling season about 1 • 30 or 2 p.m .) when it is suspended for prayers, a few cups of coffee, and an hour's rest; nor is it again interrupted, after being resumed in the afternoon, until the approach ol evening. Soon after Maghrib or evening prayers the divers take a substantial meal of fish, rice and dates, and then, after a little smoking and coffee-drinking, retire to rest for the night. The Ghais, before entering the sea, strips of his clothes, places a pair of horn pincers called Fatam (plural Aftamah) on his nose to compress his nostrils, plugs his ears with cotton-wool, or bees 1 wax, and puts on leather finger-stalls, called Khabat (singular Khabatah) to protect his fingers from abrasions; he also attaches a small bag or Diyin (plural Diyain) of coir matting to his person, by hanging it round his neck or fastening it to his waist. To aid him in his descent he has a stone or lead sinker weighing 10 to 14 lbs.; this is fastened to a rope called Zaibal (plural Ziyabil), having above the weight a noose, in which the diver_places his foot and so is lowered to the bottom of the sea; a second rope, called Ida (plural Ayadi), is fixed to his girdle and is used to raise him to the surface again. On reaching the bottom the diver removes his foot from the noose in the Zaibal, which is immediately hauled up by his attendant Saib, and proceeds to grope his way along the bottom with one hand and one foot, using the second foot to propel himself and the disengaged hand to collect oysters within his reach, and place them in the Diyin. It is said that the oysters are generally found open-mouthed, but close up when approached. When he cannot hold his breath any longer, the diver signals to the Saib by jerking the Ida to which he clings, and is immediately pulled up to the surface and relieved of the shells he has brought. The shells gathered by a Ghais in a single plunge or Tabbah (plural, Tabbat) generally number from 3 to 20; sometimes however he returns entirely empty-handed. The time occupied by the plunge is usually from 40 to 75 seconds, but only a few divers can remain below water for more than one minute.* In the intervals between plunges, the Ghais, unless the sea is rough, rests in the water, supporting himself by an oar or by a rope which hangs over the side of the boat. The same diver will make as many as 50 plunges in a day if the weather is favourable, but only 10 or 20 if the water is cold. It is rarely that a diver is attacked by a shark (Jarjur) or dogfish (Kalb-al-Bahr); but in 1900 an unusual number of sharks made their appearance off the banks and attacked nearly 30 divers, two of whom were killed under water, while others were rescued in a precarious condition. The diver sometimes suffers from the stings of the devil-fish or Hammah, and when there are many of these about he wears a long white shirt to protect him from their embraces. The exertion of diving is greatly increased by the existence of a current, and, where currents prevail, the diver is frequently floated away to a distance from the boat, and comes up much exhausted; in such places a long rope is allowed to trail from the boat, to which the Ghais can swim on reaching the surface and be hauled in by the Saib. Here it may be mentioned that the occupation of diving, though a severe form of labour and fatiguing at the time, is not considered by those engaged in it to be particularly injurious to the health, and that it is practised even by old men; on the other hand, it undoubtedly gives rise, in some cases, to diseases of the respiratory system and to deafness, A common ailment among divers is a skin disease, to guard against which those who are liable to it occasionally rub themselves belore going to sleep with a decoction, called Jaft, from the inner shell of the Persian acorn, t Senna leaves and a few other common drugs are carried by pearling boats; but, in case of serious illness, recourse is generally had, whatever the nature of the symptoms, to actual cautery with a hot iron. * In Ceylon it was observed that few divers remained more than minutes below, and that none reached 2 minutes; 15 oysters was apparently an ordinary number for a diver to bring up with him. . «r i t Dr. S. J. Thomas, M.D., of the American Mission Hospital, Bahrain, writes:— It has been my observation that pearl-divers are prone to disease of the respiratory system that may be caused by over-distention of the lungs and pressure, such as hemorrhage and pulmonary emphysema, also to deafness from perforation of the ear-drum, and to various forms oi aural catarrh; but, with the method used by the divers here, not to ' paralysis and cramp . In six years of experience here I have not seen a case of paralysis due to diving. There is a peculiar skin disease among divers and all classes that spend most of their lives in the sea such as the nshermen and boatmen. The skin takes on a glazed appearance and breaks out in small postules which generally heal in a few weeks without treatment if they do not go into the salt water during this time, but ave never found a treatment that influenced the disease perceptibly where the Patient pursued his occupation in the sea water. T believe the divers do use the decoction mentioned (Jatt) sometimes, and it is difficult to say of how much value it is as a prophylactic; but it seems to have little, i any, curative effect when the disease is once established '. 48533 Q 2110 Prevalence of debt. Social life, customs and discipline on the Arabian pearl banks Social life on the banks is confined to the hours of the evening, when the Nakhudas and their crews visit friendly boats to enjoy coffee, wafer cakes and tobacco, and to compare notes of their proceedings. During the season a small bazaar is formed on Dalmah Island for the sale of supplies, and Tawwashes or petty dealers and Musaqqams come there to buy pearls and recover debts. On the occasion of a Tabrah being discovered by a diver he receives a new suit of clothes from the Nakhuda, and the rest of the crew too become entitled to receive a present. A man also who finds a good pearl in opening the oysters is specially rewarded. Quarrels are of rare occurrence on the pearling ground, and the boats even of hostile tribes may be seen peacefully anchored within a few cables' length of one another. The boats of each district form a fleet, with one of the Nakhudas, appointed before sailing by the Shaikh of the district, as its Admiral. The principal duty of the Admiral is to fix the day for cessation of work and return to port. No diver is willing to remain on the banks longer than his fellows, and the premature departure of even one boat, however successful it might have been, would probably bring about a strike of all the divers from the same district remaining on the banks; consequently no boat is permitted to leave until the Admiral has hoisted the signal for departure, and boats that reach home before the return of the Admiral are, in the absence of a sufficient excuse, severely dealt with by the Shaikh to whose jurisdiction they belong. A boat which returned to Kuwait prematurely in September 1905 was at once sent back to the fishery. Most crews, however, pay one or more brief visits to port in the course of the season to see their families, to take in provisions and to clear off the barnacles which have collected on the sides of the boats; in Bahrain one such interval is simultaneously observed by all boats, under the name of SaifTyah. Division of profits in the pearl fishery on the Arabian side.* On return from the banks the Nakhuda, if financed by a Musaqqam, is bound to hand over to his creditor the whole take of pearls, and all the shells brought home, at a rate previously arranged which varies from 15 to 20 per cent, below market value. This discount of 15 to 20 per cent, constitutes, in the case supposed, the profit of the Musaqqam; and the price of 80 to 85 per cent, of value paid by the Musaqqam is divided among the owner, Nakhuda, and crew of the boat. The Nakhuda is not however precluded from disposing of the pearls and shells to a third party, provided that the price he obtains will enable him to discharge his obligations to the Musaqqam, and that the Musaqqam is himself not willing to give so much; and, as in practice the Musaqqim is generally unwilling or afraid to bid against the Tajir or professional pearl merchant, the Nakhuda frequently sells to a merchant. In the division of what remains after the claims of the Musaqqam, if any, have been satisfied, the owner of the boat receives one-fifth of the whole; the cost of the rations supplied to the crew during the season is next deducted for repayment to the person by whom it was advanced; and the balance is then divided up among the operatives, the Nakhuda and each Ghais or diver receiving 3 shares, each Saib or hauler 2, and each Radhif or extra hand 1; the Walaid or apprentice is not entitled to a share. The Nakhuda, besides command ing the boat, may also own her, and may himself take part in the work of diving: in this case he will be remunerated not only as a Nakhuda, but also as an owner and a diver in addition. Financial regulations of the pearl fishery on the Arabian side. Pearling operations having been carried on in the past very largely with borrowed capital and being still to a considerable extent so financed, it is not surprising to find that the industry is governed by stringent customs as to debt, which have the force of law and are steadily enforced by local tribunals. To make the situation intelligible it should be explained that many Nakhudas, especially those who are not owners of boats, owe more than they can pay to their Musaqqams on account of the expenses of fitting out and provisioning their vessels and of retaining the services of capable divers by giving them money advances; also that even those Nakhudas who are Khali or free from debt are often in a precarious * Here we give only the rules for a Khalawi or ordinary boat; but there is a specially organised boat called 'Amil, in which the rule of distribution is different. See Annexure No. 6 under ' Dibai.'Ill position, inasmuch as they are responsible for the debts due from their divers to Nakhudas by whom the divers may have been previously employed. In a similar way, and even more generally, the divers are indebted to their Nakhudas for advances, and, being an extravagant class, the amounts which they have borrowed are often large and in some cases reach so high a figure as RS.3,000 a diver; yet, in the stress of competition which now prevails, the Nakhudas dare not refuse advances to their divers, even in the off-season, in case they should desert them and take service elsewhere. In view of their own financial responsibilities and of the probability that the whole debt due by a diver may be lost in event of his death, Nakhudas are extremely careful in the choice of their Ghasah. It is evident that, under such a system of finance and in such a society as have been described, the rights of lenders can only be safeguarded by rules of an exceedingly drastic character. , • , . . . The Nakhuda, as we have already stated, is obliged, in certain circumstances, Musaqqams to transfer the whole of the season's take to his Musaqqam at a rate equal to about and four-fifths of its market value; should he disregard this obligation and dispose Nakhudas. of his pearls to any other person, the purchaser becomes liable to the Musaqqam for the amount of the Nakhuda's debts, even if they exceed the value of the pearls which he has bought. The Musaqqam, on the other hand, has the right to abrogate his connection with the Nakhuda at any time, if he finds it to his interest to do so; and, should the Nakhuda, when this occurs, be unable to pay his debts, the Musaqqam may insist on the sale of the Nakhuda's boat, if he owns one, after which the divers belonging to the boat may be engaged by new masters, on payment to the insolvent Nakhuda of the debts which stand against their names in his books: the house and other property of the Nakhuda, however, are exempt from seizure, unless specially included as security in the agreement between himself and the Musaqqam. There is, however, an alternative to these severe measures and, except in the case of wilfully defaulting Nakhudas, it is almost invariably preferred by the Salifat-al-Ghaus,—a tribunal presently to be mentioned; it consists in the fixing of annual instalments for the discharge of the debt, and, when this has been done by a decree of the Salifat-al-ohaus and a paper has been given by the Musaqqam to the Nakhuda stating the amount of the debt and of the annual instalment, the Nakhuda is free to form relations with another Musaqqam, In the event of his finding a patron, the new Musaqqam by whom ne is entertained becomes liable to the former Musaqqam for the regular payment of the annual instalments and so continues as long as the Nakhuda remains m his service, and the debts of the original Musaqqam must be discharged in full before the new Musaqqam can claim repayment of any^ which may have become due to himself, but the second Musaqqam enjoys a priority over any third or later Musaqqam similar to that which the first Musaqqam possesses in regard to nimselr. The obligations of divers to Nakhudas are similar, that is to say, no diver Nakhudas may leave the service of a Nakhuda to whom he owes anything, and, if a diver and divers, violates this rule, the new Nakhuda by whom he is entertained is held responsib e to the old Nakhuda for the whole amount of the debts due to the latter by tne The Musaqqam, it should be noted, is not bound to dispose of his pearls to capitalists the merchant from whom he may have borrowed money for his operations. Musaqqams. The rules just described are enforced in every Arab principality by a tribunal Tribunals, known as the Salifat-al-Ghaus or ' Diving Court.' This tribunal is no a permanent institution but is constituted, when required, by the - iai o principality, who appoints one or more men—generally Nakhudas of rep are well versed in the usages of the pearl fisheries—to compose it an ^ act f.^^f - Before this tribunal the Musaqqam, the Nakhuda and the diver all stand on an equal footing; and by its decision they are absolutely bound. e not itself administer oaths, and, when an oath is necessary, t e par i before a Qadhi in order that it may be taken.

The annual quantities exported since 1873 are given in Annexure No. 2 to this Appendix. Sovereignty and dues in relation to the pearl fisheries. Coast of On the Arabian side all the banks, whether near to or far from the coast, are Arabia. f ree to the pearl fishers of Arabia and Persia without distinction of race or nationality. The boats from particular ports generally frequent certain localities more than others, but they do this of choice and not of necessity. The chiefs of the Arab littoral derive revenue from the pearl fisheries, but only by means of taxes imposed on their own subjects or on persons resident in their respective jurisdictions: a table of these imposts will be found in Annexure 6 to this Appendix. It has been stated that the chiefs of Trucial 'Oman are entitled to receive, besides the dues mentioned in the Annexure No. 6, a share in the sale price of any pearl worth $200 or more which may have been found by a subject, but no particular share is specified, and it does not appear that the claim is universally, or even generally, admitted; on the other hand a decision in favour of the Sultan of 'Oman, mentioned below, seems to raise a presumption that such a right is, in some circumstances, allowed. The first chief to levy dues is believed to have been the Shaikh of Bahrain, who is said to have instituted about the beginning of the 19th century, under the name of Nob, a tax which was devoted (at least in theory) to the maintenance of 4 armed vessels on the banks for the protection of the Bahrain pearl fleet. With the growth of security under British surveillance of the Gulf these police vessels, if they ever existed, disappeared; but the system of taxation was maintained both by the Shaikh of Bahrain and by the other Arab chiefs, who had meanwhile followed his example.* The amount of the Nob was originally one diver's share per boat, but crews might compound for it at the rate, in early times of $3, and later of $4, per operative. A second tax, called Taraz, also came into general vogue many years ago; it was originally assessed at the rate of one diver's share for each boat. The intention was to provide the means of engaging hired watchmen in towns and villages during the absence in summer of the able-bodied male population; and a part of the dues now realised is even yet spent in this manner on summer watchmen called Matraziyah. Persia. It appears that Nob is properly a tax on boats and Taraz a poll tax on operatives, also that Nob was originally collected only in autumn and Taraz only in spring; but the terms are not now clearly understood even by the natives of the Gulf themselves. Much confusion has been caused by irregularity in collection, the people always endeavouring to pay as little as possible, and the Shaikhs to take as much as they can, and that in advance. All the banks on the Persian side, with the exception of the banks in the Lingeh District which are public, are subject to territorial jurisdiction; this is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that they are all near the coast and in few, if any, cases more than 3 miles distant from land. The subjects of the Shaikh in whose territory a bank is situated may work on it without special permission, and so may the subjects of a neighbouring Shaikh who is on terms of amity with the territorial Shaikh; but all foreigners—that is to say all others, and among them Arab pearl fishers from the opposite side of the Gulf,—must come to a special arrangement with the local authority before they are allowed to dive on any Persian bank. The taxes ordinarily levied by the Shaikhs from their own subjects and from those of friendly Shaikhs on the same coast are given in Annexure No. 6; and here we may add that the sum realised by the Shaikhs from outsiders who wish to work upon their banks generally varies from $20 to $40 per boat for the season, and that the permission is given in writing. The finder of a valuable pearl is expected to bring it secretly to the Shaikh, and, if he does so, he is generally compelled to part with it on payment of a mere fractions of its value; if, on the other hand, he fails to bring it, his life and property will both be in danger. * There is some doubt as to the correctness of these statements. There is not now any pearl tax called Nob in Bahrain.113 Revenue from the pearl fisheries is not as yet included in the Pessian Tumar or list of revenue assets for each district, and the local Shaikhs conceal the amount of their incomes from this source as best they can from the Persian Government. When the Nizam-as-Saltaneh was Governor of the Gulf Ports he aspired to levy a Malyat of 4,000 Tumans on the pearl banks of the Shibkuh and Lingeh Districts; but the Shaikhs refused to pay % and he was unable to give effect to his intentions'. In the Governorship of the Sa ad-ul-Mulk, however, with the connivance of the merchants of Lingeh, a Malyat of Rs. 800 per annum was assessed by the Persian Deputy-Governor on 30 pearl boats of the A1 Bii Samait tribe at Lingeh Town and has ever since been regularly collected; this is the sole item of revenue which any Persian official recovers from pearl fisheries, and it is believed that the proceeds are divided between the Governor of the Gulf Ports and the Deputy-Governor of Lingeh. Political questions connected with the pearl fisheries. We have seen that the pearl fisheries are, on the western side of the Persian Gulf, the chief means of livelihood of the people; that they are participated in by the subjects of a number of separate states and principalities; and that they are at present carried on entirely by the native inhabitants of the Gulf. From these facts spring political considerations of great importance, which we propose to explain and illustrate in a short historical review, dealing first with matters of a purely local kind, and then with issues of a wider and international character.

Inland the depth of the district is on the average about 20 miles. On the landward side 'Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, by the Jafurah desert on the south and south -west, and by Qatar on the north-west. The coast of 'Aqal is embayed by a great opening, Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin, which is 20 miles deep and, being about 16 miles wide at its entrance, occupies nearly a half of the whole sea frontage of 'Aqal; this inlet is rather nearer to the Khor -al -'Odaid end of the district than to the other. The depth of the bay varies over the greater part of its extent from 4 to 10 fathoms, but in different parts of it there are shoals. The soil of 'Aqal in the proximity of the sea is fairly firm, and the land rises in steps to a height of several feet; behind the ridges thus formed, which are of a reddish colour, lies a tract of heavy dark sand with hillocks of light-coloured sand occurring at intervals. The principal camping grounds in the district are the following:— Name. Position. Remarks. Dhuwaihin About 10 miles inland, south- westwards, from the foot of Dohat-adh-Dhuwaihin. The principal camping place in the district. There is 1 well about 2 fathoms deep, surrounded by 10 smaller ones each a fathom deep: the water of all is good. Nakhalah ('Aqalat-an-) 5 to 10 miles inland, south-south- westwards, from the foot of Dohat-an-Nakhalah. The spot lies among sand hills. Good water occurs near the surface over a considerable area. The place is frequented by the Manasir and A1 Morrah. Nathil (Saudah) 20 to 25 miles inland, westwards, from the foot of Khor-al- 'Odaid. Wells yield good water at 1 fathom. 'Odaid On the south shore of Khor-al- 'Odaid, at a little way from the entrance. See article Khor-al -'Odaid. Rims ('Aqalat-ar-) 5 to 10 miles inland, westwards, from the foot of Khor-al- 'Odaid. Water is good, in wells 1 fathom deep. The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and it must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial 'Oman. T . _ . , , x Singular 'Amiri. A large Arab tribe of 'Oman, by race Nizariyah, but now 'AWAMIR in politics Hinawiyah. About one-third of them are Bedouins ranging the borders [pp. m-S] of the Ruba'-al-Khali from Trucial 'Oman in the north, which they occasionally visit in small numbers, to the district of Dhufar on the southern coast ot Arabia. The other two-thirds are now settled, chiefly in 'Oman Proper where t ey possess the villages of 'Aqil, Qal 'at-al-'Awamir, Falaj, Hamaidhan, Qunyatain, Qarut, Khurmah, Shafa', Saiyahi and Suq -al-Qadim and are found at Nizwa: they occur also at Masqat Town, Bait-al-Falaj and Ruwi in the Masqat Dis nc , at Ghallah and Sad in Wadi Boshar; at Hail A1 'Umair, Sib and Mabilah in Batinah; at Kh5dh in Wadi Samail and at Khubar and Luwiz in Daghmar. In 'Oman Proper the settled 'Awamir number about 2,500 souls and are dmded into the following sections: Ahmad (Aulad), '^Ali-bin -Hamad (Aulad), Jf * ', (Aulad), Amir (Aulad), Haramilah, Ja'afarah, Ja id Muhammad, Musa (Aulad), Rakhbah, Rashid (Aulad), Saba (Aulad),^ Salim (Aulad), Sand (Aulad), Sarahin, Sarahin-al -Muwailah and Shiraz (Aulad), * The information, contained in the article was suppHed by Captain F.B. Agent in Bahrain. His map may be consulted {Map of Jafurah, etc.), Trucial 'Oman. 82385120 v v BARAIMI OASIS* [pp. 2(50-5] those at Nizwa are of the Aulad Saif section, and at Sib a section called Aulad Mahaiyi are found. The settled Awamir outside Oman Proper are about 4,000 persons. r ^ . 1 . Their migratory habits and the slightness oi their contact with civilisation renders a close estimate of the strength of the Bedouin portion impossible; but, regard being had to the wideness of their distribution, they may safely be assumed to be numerous and perhaps amount to 3,500 souls. The total strength of the tribe is thus probably about 10,000 souls. . i , A term 'Afar, frequently used in connection with the Awamir, appears to denote a portion of the tribe inhabiting a particular territory, called Afar or Dhafrah, between Mahot and Dhufar; it includes representatives of many sections. The' 'Awamir are reputed brave and warlike, but crafty, treacherous and predatory; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet, not exceptins members of their own tribe with whom they happen to be unacquainted. The 'Afar are popularly supposed to feed upon carrion: they deny this, but admit that they are not infrequently reduced to devouring the animals' skins with which some of them are clothed. The 'Awamir speak a peculiar dialect of Arabic and the language of the westernmost sections is hardly intelligible to their settled brethren in 'Oman Proper. The tribe is Ibadhi in religion: they are at feud with the Jannabah and the Daru'. The tribal capital is ' Aqil, and the present Tamimahs are Suhail-bin-Aswad and Biban-bin-Biban. In English formerly spelt ' Brymee,' a remarkable oasis in the district of Jau, in a tract situated between the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial 'Oman which may be described as Independent 'Oman; it was formerly known as Tuwamiyah, but this name has fallen into disuse. Position and extent. —The exact situation by latitude and longitude of Jimi, one of the most central villages in the oasis, is given in the table of villages below; it shows the oasis to lie a little south of a straight line drawn between the towns of Sohar and Abu Dhabi, about 65 miles west by south of the former, and 85 miles east by south of the latter. The plain of Baraimi is bordered on the north by the wilderness of Ramlat Kahal; on the east by well-wooded plains and small ridges of hills belonging to the district of Jau; on the south by Jabal Hafit; and on the west by the first dunes of an ocean of sand that stretches without interruption to the coast of Abu Dhabi. The oasis is nearly circular and its diameter is about six miles. Inhabitants and villages. —The population of Baraimi amounts to about 5,500 souls, of whom the greater number are Dhawahir, some are Na'im and a few are Bani Yas. The general condition of the people is poor, probably in consequence of tribal warfare and chronic insecurity rather than of the natural conditions of their existence, and the prosperity which seems to distinguish the place is said to be more apparent than real. The food of the inhabitants is mainly dates and coarse bread or rice, but they vary their diet with salt fish and goats' or camels' flesh. Milk is abundant, and a hard cream cheese is made, the juice of the euphorbia being sometimes used instead of rennet. The women wear an unbecoming black veil and high-heeled shoes: their work is to spin, to weave, to make felt, and to tend the goats and kine. The following is a table, alphabetically arranged, of the villages of the Baraimi Oasis:— Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. 'Ain Dhawahir About 3 miles south of Baraimi Village. A village of 280 houses of Dhawahir of the Jawabir sec tion. Sometimes merely called 'Ain. The lands are watered by 2 Falajs, one of which comes from the east and the other (called Dawuidi) Irom Jabal Hafit. Date palms are estimated at 20,000, and livestock are said to be 40 horses, 150 camels, 100 donkeys, 100 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats. Baraimi Village H miles east-south- east of Jimi, of which the position has been astrono mically determined. See article Baraimi Village. ♦ The map for the Baraimi Oasis is Route taken by Major P. Z. Cox, etc., 1905 ; see first footnote in article Trucial 'Oman.121 Name.

It is nearly in the centre of the oasis. 3 miles south-west of Baraimi Village. 2 t miles north-north west of Village. Baraimi west of Village. Baraimi 1^ miles north-west by north of Barai mi Village. Nature. A village of 80 houses of Dhawahir of the Daramikah section, A date plantation with a few huts of care-takers. A village of 200 houses of Dha wahir of the Bani Sa'ad section. Remarks. Irrigation is by a Falaj coming from the hills to the north-east. Re sources are 2,000 date palms, 40 camels, 20 donkeys, 20 cattle and 60 sheep and goats: there are no horses. The place belonged originally to the Dhanahir, but it is now owned by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who reclaimed it about ten years ago. The water supply is from the east. Date trees are estimated at 6,000 and livestock at 6 horses, 60 camels, 40 donkeys, 40 cattle and 100 sheep and goats. 1 mile east by south of Baraimi Village. A village of 200 houses of Dha wahir of the Dara mikah section. An encampment of Bani Yas, lately started by Kahli- fah, the eldest son of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. An old abandoned fort, adjoining the Falaj which goes to Mas'udi. A village of 120 houses of Dha wahir of the Dara mikah section. A village of 100 houses of Na'im of the Qaratisah section. Water is from Jabal Hafit by Falaj. There are said to be here 4,000 date palms, 40 camels, 20 donkeys, 20 cattle and 70 sheep and goats, but no horses. The lands are watered by a Falaj which first passes Muraijib. As yet there are no resources except a few recently planted date trees. The fort was built and used by the grandfather of the present Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The lands are irrigated by a Falaj coming from the hills on the north-east. Resources are esti mated at 5,000 date palms, 60 camels, 30 donkeys, 40 cattle and 100 sheep and goats; there are no horses. The Falaj by which the date groves are irrigated comes from the north-east. There are said to be 10,000 date trees here; also 100 camels, 50 donkeys, 50 cattle and 500 sheep and goats. The villages are unwalled and consist of houses, built of mud and date branches, which are scattered and concealed among the plantations. Besides those occupie there are many empty and dilapidated habitations. i r i Agriculture—The general aspect of the oasis is verdant and fruitful, the soil though thin is fertile, and streams of running water abound on every si e, these are brought by Falaj from the hills, sometimes several miles distant, and supply the deficiency of the slight rainfall. Each village has its separate belt of date groves; within the village the subdivision of arable land among minute, and individual holdings are on the average extremely sr ' a '- , t . Attention has been devoted with success to the culture of dates and other fruits; of cereals and vegetables the quantity and quality are at c R 2 82385122 BARAIMI VILLAGE* \ Some of the best varieties of date are grown, including the Fard, Khalas and Mibsali sorts; but they are not held in equal estimation with the produce of Wadi Samail and Badiyah in the 'Oman Sultanate. The palms of the oasis number about 60,000. Fruits other than dates are lemons, sour and sweet limes, pomegranates, water melons, musk melons, bananas, mangoes, grapes, figs and olives: the papai also exists. Cereals are wheat and barley in spring, and jowari and millet in autumn; vegetables include sweet potatoes, radishes, brinjals, beans, onions and garlic. Pulse, cotton—both of the white and the red flowered varieties —and lucerne yielding 8 to 9 crops a year are among the other products. Leguminous plants are not here sown among cereals, but follow them in rotation on the same ground; stubble, too, is ploughed in and never burnt. It is said that coffee was once cultivated on the slopes of Jabal Hafit, but the plantations, if any ever existed, have now disappeared. Livestock. —Horses are only seen in the possession of Shaikhs, and cattle too are somewhat scarce; but camels are cheap and abundant, and donkeys are largely in use both as riding animals and as beasts of burden. The villages of the oasis are reckoned to possess in the aggregate about 50 horses, 550 camels, 300 donkeys, 300 cattle and 2,500 sheep and goats. Besides these a number of horses, said to be as many as 100, are ordinarily kept by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the Oasis. Trade. —There are few or no professional traders, but a primitive local market is held each afternoon in one of the quarters of Baraimi Village; here commodities mostly change hands by barter. The foreign trade of Baraimi passes chiefly through the port of Sharjah, which is distant nearly 80 miles north-north-westwards, but also to some extent through the other coast towns of Dhabi, Dibai and Sohar. Political position. —fiarajmi is independent, but the influence of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has recently acquired (and is now engaged in developing) an estate at Jahali, while Mas'udi is being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover a regular tribute, of which the form and amount are mentioned in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, is paid him by the Dhawahir who are numerically a majority in the oasis. At the present time the Shaikh could probably seize Baraimi if he wished to do so, but his policy appears to be one of pacific penetration. The Na'im are the original owners of the oasis, and possession of the fort in Baraimi Village still gives them prestige and a local superiority over the Dhawahir. A few Manasir of the Abu Khail subsection frequent the Baraimi Oasis or its neighbour hood in summer. The original and most central village of the Baraimi Oasis. It consists of 9 quarters stretching northwards from a fort which may be regarded as one of them. The quarters are given below in alphabetical order; they are mostly inhabited by Na'im of the Qaratisah and other sections, and the population may be estimated at 500 souls altogether. Name of quarter. Houses and inhabitants. Remarks. 'Azzazinah (Harat-al-) 7 houses. Daramikah (Harat-ad-) 11 houses. This is the quarter furthest from the fort. Fudhah (Harat-al-) 17 houses. Hillah or Suq 7 houses of Khidamah This quarter contains the market place, where of the Na 'im. there are a few booths of the ubiquitous Persian shopkeeper, but most of the wares are displayed on the ground; they include grain, handkerchiefs, lungis, matches, locks, bottles, etc. Several hundred people collect here in the afternoon and the sight is an interesting one. Kunud (Harat-al-) 9 houses of Kunud. Muhammad-bin-'Ali (Harat) 17 houses. Qasr Contains a few houses A fort. Described below: its possession is the source of the strength of the Na'im in occupied by a tribal garrison of Na'im. Baraimi. Shindaghah 16 houses. ... * Authorities. Reports by Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from personal observation, also Col. Miles in his Route between Sohar and el Bereymi in 'Oman.123 There is also a quarter called Hamasah on the west of the Qasr. Except the fort none of these quarters are walled; some of the houses are of mud and some are huts of date branches. There is no bazaar except that mentioned as situated in the Hillah quarter. The resources of the village are estimated at 100 camels, 50 donkeys, 50 cattle, 500 sheep and goats and 10,000 date palms. The Baraimi fort consists of a square with sides about 150 feet in length: the whole construction is of sun-dried brick. At each corner stands a tower about 40 feet high; but the curtains connecting the towers are less than 20 feet in height. A ditch 25 feet broad surrounds the place: both the scarp and counter-scarp are steep and faced with brick. Two wells in the interior yield water, apparently of good quality and sufficient for a large garrison. The situation of the fort, standing in a plain, is generally good; but on the north and west it is too nearly adjoined by houses and cultivation, and on the opposite side the ruins of another fort were (in 1875) capable of affording shelter to an attacking force. A wooden gate in the south face was (in 1875) the weakest feature of the work. The Baraimi fort is not equal to the best of those in the Sultanate of 'Oman, but it is the key of the 'Oman Sultanate on the west, and must necessarily, as has been observed, be reduced or masked by an invader of the Sultanate approaching from that direction. An island off the coast of Abu Dhabi territory in Trucial 'Oman, a little to DALMAH the south of an imaginary line connecting Abu Dhabi Town with the entrance of [^- 363] Khor-al -'Odaid and rather more than twice the distance from the former that it is from the latter. Dalmah is elliptical in shape, with its longer axis running north and south, and it has a narrow projection at its southern end. Its length is 5 and its breadth 2^ miles, and the surface, except for a very low, narrow plain at the south end, is hilly, the highest point being 244 feet above sea level. Plenty of brackish water is obtainable from wells, and there are deposits of red oxide of iron which are not at present considered worth removal. A small settlement of about 15 families of the Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas tribe exists on the west side of the southern plain; the inhabitants wade for pearls in winter, besides diving for them in summer, and are keepers of goats. Dalmah is a place of some importance at the end of the pearl season, when a temporary bazaar of some 10 shops springs up, and a number of persons engaged in the pearl trade meet there to settle their accounts. Among these are the majority of the Indian traders on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, who come here to recover debts and make purchases of pearls. Several pearl banks exist in the vicinity, among which are:—Umm-as- Sulsul and Manyokh, 8 and 5 miles respectively to the north; Hawad Bin- Musammih, 9 miles to the south-east; Abu Dastur 4 miles to the south-west; and, besides several others which are nearer, Halat Dalmah 27 miles to the north west. Dalmah belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. An Arab principality, the most extensive and one of the two most important DHABI in Trucial 'Oman. princi- Bomdaries and divisions.- —Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from Khor-al- polity Ghanadhah, which divides it from the Shaikhdom of Dibai, on the east to Khor- r 405-11] al -'Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the bay of Umm-al-Hul near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government ot India: Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his state in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor- al -'Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined: it is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi Oasis, but without taking it in; and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al-Khali. The principal divisions of Abu Dhabi upon the mainland in order from west to east are 'Aqal, Mijan, Sabakhat Matti, Dhafrab (including Bainunah, Liwah and other minor tracts), possibly Khatam, and finally what may be called the home district in which the capital, Abu Dhabi Town, is situated: these tracts, except the last, all form the subjects of separate articles. The insular possessions of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi are the islands of Arzanah, Daiyinah, Dalmah, Das, Qarnain, Salali, Yas and Zirko, and, these also being described elsewhere under their own names, it only remains to deal with the geography of the home division. * For authorities, maps, charts, etc., see first footnote to the article Trucial Oman.124 Physical characteristics and topography of the home division. —This part of the principality apparently consists altogether of undulating sandy desert with scanty grazing and a poor water-supply. The following are the inhabited places and other points in it of which the names are most frequently heard:— Name. Batin Batin (Khor-al-)* Dhabi (Abu) Town. Ghanadhah (Khor-al-) Huwail (Bui) Iblis (Suq) Juhar Maqta' Position. On the northern shore of Khor-al- Batin, about miles within the entrance. The north side of the entrance is about miles south west of the nearest part of Abu Dhabi Town. 42 miles south-west of Dibai Town and 36 miles north-east of Abu Dhabi Town. 35 to 40 miles west by north of the Baraimi Oasis. About 25 miles by road from Abu Dhabi Town on the way to the Baraimi Oasis. 12 miles west of the Baraimi Oasis. 10 miles inland of Abu Dhabi Town, on the route to the Baraimi Oasis. Nature. Remarks. A village of 130 date branch huts, of which 100 belong to the A1 Bu Mahair and the remainder to the Sudan tribe. A creek of which the extent is probably great, but has not been ascertained; at high tide it is a large lagoon, at low tide it is full of uncovered sand banks; the 3 fathom line does not appear to reach its interior. Khor-al- Batin communicates by way of Khor-al-Maqta' with the sea 2 or 3 miles north of Abu Dhabi Town An inlet of the sea. Well. An outcrop of light coloured sandstone, fantastically shaped, rising from the sand. Wells containing good water. A ford on a creek which connects the interior of Khor-al-Batin with the sea at a point 2 or 3 miles beyond Abu Dhabi Town. There are some date planta tions in which are situated the wells that yield the drinking water of the place The inhabitants own 50 pearl boats, but no sea going vessels. Batin village is on the north side of this Khor at 1| miles inside the entrance; immediately in front of the village is a narrow channel which is 3 feet deep at low water. One of the islands in the lagoon carries a mound called Jabal Fatai- sah which is 44 miles south-south-west of Batin village: on the north western end of the same island, 1 mile from the mound is a hut. Another island lying 3 or 4 miles to the west of the last is known as Jazirat-al-Bah- rani. See article Abu Dhabi Town. It marks the boundary be tween the Shaikhdoms of Dibai and Abu Dhabi, the north bank belonging to the former and the south bank to the latter. One route between Abu Dhabi Town and the Baraimi Oasis passes this way. There is no water here, but the projection serves as a landmark for caravans. The name means ' The Devil's Market There is some acacia jungle near. The country be longs to the Dhawahir. The name is generally pronounced Yahar. Men on foot can cross only at low tide, A fort built on a sand bank in the middle of the creek commands the passage to the mainland. South of this ford the creek is called Khor-al-Maqta', and north of it Khor-as- Sa'aidiyat. 1906. * For a representation of part of this inlet see Commander G. Sinclair's Part of Khor-al -Batin,125 Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Mashairif About 16 miles south east by east of Maqta'. Wells. Surrounded by desert. Raknah 20 miles north-west of the Baraimi Oasis. A camping ground with Ghaf trees. Frequented by Bani Yas nomads, especially those of the Qumzan section. Samaih 6 or 7 miles east and somewhat south of Khor-al-Ghanad- hah. The place is in Abu Dhabi terri tory. A locality characterised by stony hills interspersed with sand: there are some 7 wells about 15 feet deep, but the water is drinkable only after rain. Samaih is a convenient ren dezvous for Bedouins and is used as such by the Shaikhs of both Abu Dhabi and Dibai when preparing for war. Bani Yas of the Rumaithat section camp about here. Silmiyah Between Khatam and the sea, about 20 miles south-south east of Abu Dhabi Town. Wells. Inhabitants. —The settled population of the principality are merely the residents of Abu Dhabi Town and Batin village in the home division, the occupants of fixed settlements in the Liwah tract of the Dhafrah division, and the inhabitants of Dalmah island. The composition of the non-nomadic population is therefore as follows:— Tribe. Place. Number of souls. Bani Yas, Abu Dhabi Town. 2,800 Do. Liwah tract. 5,100 Do. Dalmah island. 75 A1 Bu Mahair. Abu Dhabi Town. 500 Do. Batin. 500 Sudan. Abu Dhabi Town. 375 Do. Batin. 150 Persians. Abu Dhabi Town. 500 Marar. Do. 200 Baharinah. Do. 120 Miscellaneous. Do. 635 The total is thus about 11,000 souls. . - T _ , The Bedouins of the principality are the remainder ot the Bam \ as and nearly the whole of the Manasir tribe, or together about 3,300 persons. It is probable that the nomads of the Dhawahir, Bani Qitab and Nairn sometimes cross the indefinite eastern border into the Abu Dhabi Shaikhdom, but they can hardly be reckoned to belong to it. _ i- i + /- i Resources and trade. —There is no cultivation except a httle ot dates. Camels abound; but cattle, sheep and goats are few; and pearl diving is the principal occupation even of the Bedouins. In the whole of the Shaikhdom there are about 410 pearl boats, of which the majority are owned at Abu Dhabi Town and iiO at Batin, the remainder being kept in creeks along the coast, or on islands, they are as a rule of small size and work on banks adjoining the coast or islands. ere are about 10 sea-going vessels at Abu Dhabi Town, of which 2 are Sambu s an126 the rest large jollyboats merely: these run to Bahrain, Basrah, Lingeh and Masqat but not to India. There is no trade worthy of mention outside the town of Abu Dhabi, in the article on which the subject is treated of. The villages of Muzaira'ah and Taraq in Llwah are small local centres for the distribution of goods. Communications. —The routes in the principality are described in the article on Trucial 'Oman. Administration. —The present Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Zaid-bin-Khalifah, rules his principality absolutely within the limits to which his powers of coercion extend* and, though his control over the Bedouin portion of his subjects is incomplete, as is the case more or less in all Arab Shaikhdoms, his authority over them is unusually great. His is by far the most powerful personality in Trucial 'Oman at the present time, and his influence is not only dominant throughout that region but extends to the independent Baraimi Oasis and even to 'Ibri in the Sultanate of 'Oman. An estimate of his annual revenues, in so far as they are ascertainable, follows below: the principal item, it will be observed, is that derived from the pearl fisheries:— Amount. Dues on pearl boats and operatives and other income dependent on the pearl industry 57.000 Commission levied by his son on transactions in pearls at Dalmah island ... ... 5.000 Agricultural taxes paid in kind by the Bani Yas of Liwah in Dhafrah 2 500 Five thousand Jirabs of dates worth $1 per Jirab, rendered as tribute by the Dhawahir of the Baraimi Oasis ... ... ... ... ... 5.000 Lucerne supplied by the same Dhawahir for 100 tribal horses maintained by the Shaikh in the Farainii Oasis ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 3,000 A cash subsidy paid him by the Sultan of 'Oman for restraining the Bedouins of the Baraimi Oasis and Dhahirah and preventing raids by them on the villages of Batinah, perhaps 3,000 Total 75,500 The last item, though it has been in existence for at least 10 years, has only recently come to notice: the payment is of a private and personal nature and its amount is necessarily uncertain, but the fact that it is regularly made throws much light on the present political position in 'Oman. Foreign relations and interests—Jhz ruler of Abu Dhabi is one of the Trucial Shaikhs, whose position is described in the article on Trucial 'Oman. The only loreign interests in the principality are British, and these are described in the article on Abu Dhabi Town. mun 1 ca P^ a ^ ^habi Principality in Trucial 'Oman and the only TOWN settlement of importance which that principality contains. Abu Dhabi Town is situated on the coast of Trucial 'Oman about 88 miles south-west of Sharjah Town: it extends tor about \\ miles along the low sandy coast and consists chiefly of mat huts with a tew stone buildings. At sea, 15 miles to the northward, is Hadd, the nearest of the Persian Gulf pearl banks. The largest edifice is the fort ol the Shaikh at a little distance inland behind the town; not lar from it, on the outskirts of the town proper, is the separate bazaar of the Indian traders. The anchorage^ for large vessels is totally unsheltered and lies more than two miles oil the shore. At the back of the town are some stunted date trees and water is obtained from wells: 35 years ago most of the drinking water ol the place used to be fetched from Dibai, but recently potable water has become obtainable in the vicinity of the town, especially at a place 3 or 4 miles irom it, pits are dug in which the water collects at 4 to 5 feet below the ground id - Immcdiatel y ^ ie sou th of the town is the large shallow lagoon of Khor- al-Batin, and to the east a creek connected with it, both of which are described in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality. The population ol the town may be about 6,000 souls, about ^ Bani Yas and the rest other tribes. The Bani Yas sections are A1 Bu Falah, 40 persons; Qubaisat, 380; Maharibah, 300;_ Al Bu Falasah, 200; Qumzan, 250; Al Bu Hamir,_300; ruimaithat, 500, Mazari', 300; and Hawamil, 500. The other tribes are Al Bu Mahai^ SOO; Sudan, 375; Marar, 200; Thamairat, 120; Al Bin Nasir, 120; Al Bu Amim, 120; Khamarah (said to be originally from Khamir in Persia), 375; * A plan of this anchorage is given in Chart No. 2373—2837-A.127 Halalamah, 75; Dahailat, 200; and Baharinah, 120. To these must be added a Persian community of about 500 persons and 65 Hindus. The inhabitants of Abu Dhabi live almost entirely by pearl diving and fishing or in a few cases by petty trade: they have no ordinary cultivation and very few dates. Particulars of shipping are given in the article on Abu Dhabi Principality. About 750 camels belong to the place, and there are 85 horses; but of the horses all except 5 belong to the Shaikh and his family. Trade with the interior is insignificant, being only with the Baraimi Oasis and with the Bani Yas and Manasir tribes. There are over 70 shops of all sorts in the Abu Dhabi bazaar; 40 are kept by Persians, 19 by Hindus and 10 by Arabs. Pearls are the sole export. The Hindus import cloth, rice, coffee and sugar besides dealing in pearls. British interests are represented here by the Hindu trading community, all from Tatta in Sind; the majority have their families with them, and most of them take leave to India at intervals of about a year. In the pearl season the number of Hindus is about doubled. No Muhammadan Indians do business at this place. The westernmost and least known part of 'Oman, a subdivision of Trucial DHAFRAH* 'Oman. [pp. 412-27] Boundaries. —Dhafrah lies between the Persian Gulf on the north and the Ruba'-al-KMli or Great Desert of Southern Arabia on the south; on the west it is bounded by Sabakhat Matti and Jafurah, and on the east by Khatam. Divisions. —The huge area thus defined comprises at least 5 separate tracts which are distinguished by names, but the absence of striking natural features makes it difficult to determine their relative positions and extent. Indeed there is reason to think that the internal boundaries of Dhafrah are somewhat vague, and that the names of the tracts are not employed by all Bedouins in strictly the same sense. The 5 tracts in question are Taff, Dhafrah proper, Bainunah, Qufa and Liwah, of which last name the correct form is said to be Al-Juwa; of these Liwah and Bainunah are the most important. All authorities agree that Liwah is the southernmost and furthest inland of the divisions of Dhafrah; that its length, which is eastwards and westwards, approaches, if it does not exceed, 175 miles; that its breadth is insignificant in comparison with its length; and that the village of Shah is situated in it almost exactly midway between its two extremities. To determine the position of Liwah it is therefore only necessary to determine the position of Shah, but here we are confronted by serious discrepancies of evidence; the most probable view, however, appears to be that Shah is situated 50 to 55 miles inland from the coast upon a line drawn due south from Ras Miqaishit, the western point ol the Salali group of islands, and that it is about 90 miles south-west by south ol Abu Dhabi Town. If this opinion errs, it is probably by bringing Shah somewhat too near to the coast and too far to westwards. The position of Bainunah depends upon that of a well Da alas, which undoubtedly belongs to this tract, though its position in the same is not, perhaps, so central as that of Shah in Liwah. According to the report which for several reasons appears most reliable, Da'afas is about 30 miles south-east of Jabal Dhannah (on the coast opposite Yas island) and about 20 miles inland from the nearest point on the sea. The alternative position attributed to Da afas is very much more southerly and more easterly than that just described. It is not disputed that Bainunah is between Liwah and the sea, nor that it reaches to the westci nmost extremity of Dhafrah, in other words to the border of Sabakhat Matth Of the remaining tracts Qufa is undoubtedly interposed between Liwah ana Bainunah and is long from east to west and narrow from north to south. Taff is, by general consent, a maritime strip extending the whole length o Dhafrah with an average depth inland of about 15 miles. Its westei nmost section, that reaching for about 25 miles on either side of Jabal Dhannah, is possib y particularised as Taff Bainunah. The last tract requiring to be located is Dhafrah proper, and the name may be taken to signify so much of Dhafrah in the wider sense as is not included in any of the foregoing divisions. The position of Dhafrah proper with reference to * Authorities. —Major P. Z.

Miles in his Route between Sohar and el-Bereymi in 'Oman. The mos rt information interior is Map of Dhafrah, Liwah, etc., 1906, compiled by Major P. Z. Cox from ' Charts of the coast are specified in the footnote to article Trucial Oman, especially cancelled Chart No. 19-B. 82385Bainunah is doubtful; but it is probably on the east while Bainunah is on the west and the distances of the two from the sea are similar. The wells of Kafaifah, it may be added, seem to be near the point at which the tracts of Bainunah and Dhafrah proper meet one another and the tract of Taff, Following then the opinion which seems most worthy of acceptance we may provisionally arrange the divisions of Dhafrah as follows:— 1. Along the coast a strip 15 miles wide, which for nearly 100 miles on the east is called Taff, and for 50 miles on the west Taff Bainunah. 2. Behind the coastal strip a belt 40 miles wide composed of Dhafrah proper, Bainunah and Qufa: of these Dhafrah proper (30 miles broad) adjoins Taff throughout its length, and Bainunah (20 miles broad) adjoins Taff Bainunah, also throughout its length, while Qufa fills the space remaining on the south of these two. 3. Inland of Qufa, and like Qufa roughly parallel to the sea, another belt measuring about 175 miles in length and perhaps 20 miles in breadth: this belt is Liwah. Physical characteristics. —The maritime tracts of Taff and Taff Bainunah contain no features of interest except a few small hills, which are possibly volcanic. The shore is stony, and at a little distance inland swamps are said to exist, inter spersed with stony mounds. Vegetation is chiefly Abal and Hams. Dhafrah proper and Bainunah are said to resemble one another in character: they form, apparently, a fairly level expanse of heavy red sand or reddish soil with occasional sand dunes of lighter colour and gravelly patches. Dhafrah proper, at least, is somewhat higher in level than Taff. Neither tract possesses any trees; but in Dhafrah proper there is some vegetation of Arta and Hadh, and in Bainunah the Arta, Markh and Abal are found: both districts afford a considerable amount of grazing for camels. The wells of Dhafrah proper seem to vary in depth between 1 and 2 fathoms and those of Bainunah between \\ and 7 fathoms, the average in the case of the latter tract being 3 fathoms. Qufa is an inhospitable region of sandy ridges with no vegetation except a few shrubs of Arta and very little water; but the few wells that occur are shallow, not exceeding 2 fathoms. Liwah is the most remarkable of all the tracts. Tt consists mainly of white undulating sand dunes, altogether without vegetation; but it contains over a score of small depressions, disposed in series or chains from east to west. These depressions are divided from one another by sandy wastes; but at the bottom of each depression there is fertile soil, supporting the cultivation of a village which generally stands upon a sandy eminence near by. These low-lying oases contain plantations o( date palms, which in a few cases are of considerabTe extent. The water level in Liwah, doubtless in the depressions, appears to be on the average at 2 fathoms beneath the surface; and except at Tharwaniyah a depth of 4 fathoms is not, it would seem, ever exceeded. Throughout Dhafrah, to speak generally, the water of the wells is of fairly good quality, and not very scarce. The wells themselves are either unlined or lined only with date sticks and leaves; the only exceptions to the rule appear to be the Babah well in Bainunah, which is reported to be half lined with masonry, and a well called Saqar, also in Bainunah but not precisely located, which is said to be entirely so lined. This peculiarity is no doubt due largely to the shallowness of the wells, but it also seems to indicate firmness in the soil. Inhabitants.—-\n the whole of Dhafrah only two tribes are found, the Bani Yas and the iManasir ; the former are settled rather than nomadic, while the latter arc altogether Bedouins. Of Liwah they are jointly occupants, but the permanent villages, called Mahdhar, all belong to the Bani Yas, the settlements of the Manasir being untenanted except in summer while the date harvest is in progress. Among the Manasir date plantations are joint tribal property, but with the Bani Yas they belong to individual owners. The Bani Y'as of Dhafrah are semicivilised; some of them trade with Abu Dhabi and even Dibai and correspond with those places. The dwellings of both tribes are huts of date sticks and leaves: the Manasir, when their sojourn in Liwah is over for the year, close theirs up and stop the adjacent wells ^ said, with sand. Dhafrah proper is the principal grazing ground of the Manasir while^Bainunah contains the favourite pastures of the Bani Yas; but m winter the Manasir range as far west as Qatar and in summer their camels are129 left with those of the Bani Yas in Bainunah. The Bani Yas of Dhafrah take a share in the pearl fishery and own a number of boats which are kept at Bandar Radaim, Khor Mughairah and Bandar Mirfah upon the coast. The number of the Bani Yas ordinarily in Dhafrah may be reckoned at 5,100 souls, while that of the Manasir is the entire strength of the tribe or 1,400 persons; and besides these there are about 70 Bedouin families of the Marar tribe who are accustomed to wander in Liwah. The whole population of Dhafrah may therefore be estimated at 6,500 souls, but it is fluctuating.

The place is much fre quented by Manasir. Wells number 10 and are 1 fathom deep. There are a few date palms. Rashid-bin-Humaid of Shah, etc., is Shaikh also of this place. It marks the boundary between Dhafrah and Sabakhat Matti. See article Yas Island. Cojrmmui cat ions. Desert routes from Bandar Mirfah, Khor Mughairah and Bandar Radaim connect the villages of Liwah with the coast. The usual stages are given as follows:— (1) Bandar Mirfah, Bada' Jarash, Babah, Majmulah, Bada' Muhammad and Kaiyih in Liwah. (2) Khor Mughairah, Kafaifah, Babah, Badi'ah, Mashairib and Muzaira'ah in Liwah. (3) Bandar Radaim, Bazummi, Dhuwannain, Qaryan, Bada' Saif, Mughailah, Istal and Shah in Liwah.137 Political position. Dhafrah, as already remarked, is a part of Trucial 'Oman and the whole of it falls within the political sphere of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to whose principality it may accordingly be considered to belong. The Bani Yas of Liwah count themselves subjects of the Shaikh, but the extent to which the Manasir are amenable to his influence is doubtful. Dhafrah has been at times the scene of prolonged contests between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the principal Shaikh of Qatar, the latter making raids into the Liwah tract, and the former retaliating by means of expeditions against Qatar, in the course of which he has been known to utilise Shwaihat upon the coast as an advanced base for his operations. A considerable Arab tribe who have their headquarters in the Baraimi Oasis DHAWAHIR and inhabit its neighbourhood: practically the whole Baraimi Oasis except the [pp. 439-40] villages of Su'arah and Baraimi belongs to them. They number perhaps 4,500 souls and are divided into 3 sections, the Daramikah, who inhabit Hili, Ma'ataradh and Qatarah; the Jawabir, who are confined to 'Ain; and the Bani Sa'ad, who own Jimi. In politics the Dhawahir are Hinawiyah; in religion Muwalik. In summer all of them inhabit villages; in winter the entire community become Bedouins. They own large flocks of sheep and many camels; they are charcoal-burners and carry their charcoal for sale to the coast of Trucial 'Oman, and elsewhere, on their own camels. The Dhawahir have probably little cultivation elsewhere than in Baraimi, unless, as some assert, the Bani Sa'ad of Ghiinah and Mad-hah in Shamailiyah belong to this tribe. Politically the Dhawahir of Baraimi are sub servient to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom they even pay tribute; and it is not unlikely that, if they were to avail themselves of their numerical superiority and of his assistance, they might be able to possess themselves of the whole oasis. Also called Khatam Al Bu Shamis. A tract dividing the region of Dhafrah KHATAM on the west from that part of Trucial 'Oman which is sometimes called 'Oman-Lw?- 1032-3] ash-Shamali on the north-east. Khatam is apparently a compact district of somewhat circular shape with an average diameter of about 40 miles; its centre appears to lie 65 or 70 miles south-east by east of Abu Dhabi town and 45 miles south-west of the Baraimi Oasis. Khatam is covered with sand dunes, but it bears some Ghaf trees, besides shrubs of Abal, Arta, Markh and Ghadha. There are a number of wells, generally varying in depth from 1 to 2 fathoms, some of which contain good and the others indifferent water. Khatam appears to be a meeting ground of the Bedouins of the Bani Yas, Manasir, and Na'im tribes; and it may perhaps be regarded, at the present time, as included in the sphere of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, whose personal influence is predominant there. In the hot weather Khatam is deserted. The following is a list of the principal wells in Khatam:— 'Ajam (Bada'-al-) Hadhaib (Imwaih-al) Jatiya 'Ankah Hadhrum (Maghail) Lahmah Artah (Bu) Hanifah Mirdah (Abu) 'Arus Hawidh (Bui) Naghalah (Umm-an-) Balqahais (Maghail) Hilyau Sablah Banadiq (Umm-al) Iqtiwah (Bu) Suwaihan Paris Bu Hadid (Ghait) Jabahinah ('Idd-al-) Singular Mansuri. A Bedouin tribe of Trucial 'Oman whose headquarters MANASIR are in Dhafrah; their general range is from Qatar on the north-west to the Baraimi [pp. 1162-4] Oasis on the east, and they are found all over Dhafrah, but especially in Dhatrah Proper and Liwah, and also in Khatam. A few frequent the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi Town and visit the Baraimi Oasis, and some are settled in the coast villages of Khan and Jumairah. On the north the tribe are in contact with the Bani Hajir in the neighbourhood of Qatar and further inland, oji the west, with the Al Morrah: their raiding parties sometimes reach Wadi Faruq. On the east their territory marches with that of the Bani Yas, with whom moreover they, are intermingled in Dhafrah; and to the south of them the country is uninhabited, being part of the Ruba'-al-Khali. The Manasir, except those at Khan and Jumairah, are altogether nomadic, most of them winter in Qatar or its neighbourhood and spend the summer in Liwah where they have temporary villages of huts and some date groves, possessed as tribal joint property. Their manner of life in Liwah is described in the article on Dhafrah. 82385 T 2138 A tabular account of the Bedouin portion of the tribe and its subdivisions follows below:— Section. Subsection. Fighting strength (of subsection). Mindhir (Al Bu) Ka'abarah 50 Do. _ Mani' (Al) 15 Do. Marashid 30 Do. Matawa'ah 100 Do. Midahimah 20 Rahamah (Al Bu) Khail (Al Bu) 200 Do.

The Al Bu Mindhir winter in the direc tion of Qatar. In summer they occupy Dahin, Tdd, Sarait and }■ Tharwaniyah in Liwah. Their lead ing Shaikh is Rashid-bin-Mani' whose summer quarters are at Sarait. The Al Bu Rahamah frequent Khatam in the cold weather and also visit Qatar, except the Abu Khail sub section who winter about Samaih and in the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi Town. In summer the Abu Khail move to the Baraimi Oasis and the remainder to Hamaim and Qa'aisah in Liwah. The sectional chief is Suwid-bin-Ghadaiyar. The Al Bu Sha'ar winter in or towards Qatar and their summer quarters are }■ in Liwah where they occupy Jarairah, Jarrah and Mosal. Their chief man is Muhammad-bin-Jaraiw, MATTI (SABA- KHAT)* [pp. 1200-J] From the above facts it may be inferred that the total number of the tribe is abou 1,400 souls. The Manasir are Hinawiyah in politics and Muwalik in religion. They were formerly subject to the Wahhabi government and in 1865 were understood to pay a contribution worth $2,000 a year, chiefly in kind, into the Wahhabi treasury; now they are independent ot all control but maintain some decree of intercourse with the town of Abu Dhabi and its Shaikh. This is the name used among the inhabitants of 'Oman; but by dwellers in Qatar and the Hasa Sanjaq it is generally called Sabakhat 'Oman, and sometimes it is even spoken of as Wadi Sabakhah. It is a coastal district in the Abu Dhabi Principality near its western end, and by some it is regarded as forming the western boundary of 'Oman in the strictly geographical sense. The extent of the district upon the coast is from Jabal Wutaid in Dhafrah to Dohat-as-Sila in Mijan, a distance of about 30 miles; and its centre is situated veiy nearly upon the 52nd meridian of east longitude. Inland it extends probably 60 miles, and its length is possibly greater at a distance from the coast than it is upon the sea. Sabakhat Matti is enclosed, landwards, by Mijari on the west, by Jafurah and possibly the Ruba'-al-Khali on the south, and by Dhafrah on the east. The well of Sufuk in Jafurah marks approximately the boundary of Sabakhat Matti on the south. The whole of the district appears to be a saline or nitrous marsh, the extreme oi desolation, without wells or grass, or even mangroves at the coast. It is said that the sea runs up the middle ot the Sabkahah at high tide for as much as 12 or 15 miles and that camels in that part of it are liable to be lost. Ordinary travellers P u ivt ^ 0 -^- as i l 1 ^, sea .' an( ^ .^ le c ^ oss i n g is so difficult, and even dangerous, that the Manasir Bedouins in their periodical migrations between Dhafrah and Qatar avoid it by deviating into the Jafurah desert to the south. ■ „,!

An Arab tribe or Trucial 'Oman and the Sultanate ofMAZARP 'Oman. The majority are HDund in Abu Dhabi territory, where they are regarded [pp-1204] as ^ section of the Bani Yas tribe, and the number of these is computed in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality; besides these some are found in Dibai Town. Similarly, the Mazari' of the 'Oman Sultanate are dealt with in the general article on that state, and an estimate of their strength is given there. The remainder are subjects of the Shaikh of Sharjah inhabiting Wadis Ham and Sfuni in the Ras -al -Khaimah District and Wadi Sfai in the district of Shamailiyah: in Wadi Ham, where they hold the villages of Adhan, 'Asimah and Fara\ their number is about 500 souls; in Wadis Sfuni and Sfai it has not been ascertained but is probably inconsiderable. Besides these there are perhaps 300 Mazarl' at the village of Khan near Sharjah Town. The extent to which the Mazari' are regarded, outside Abu Dhabi territory, as a section of the Bani Yas is uncertain; as a rule they are Ghafiri in politics and Hanbali in religion. A desert but not inhospitable tract situated on the coast of the Abu Dhabi mijan* Principality between the Sabakhat Matti on the east and the district of 'Aqal on [pp. 1205-7] the north -west. Inland it is bounded by the Jafurah desert on the west and south and by the Sabakhat Matti tract on the east. On the coast its limits are Dohat- an -Nakhalah on the west and Dohat-as-Sila' on the east and its average breadth may be about 20 miles, while southwards its boundary with Jafurah is perhaps 70 miles from the sea. The Mijan district is full of stony mounds, apparently as much as 50 or 60 feet high; at the foot of these lie firm pebbly tracts, but sand dunes also occur between. The mounds and firmer soil, it is said, are covered in winter with green grass, while Abal and dwarf tamarisk are found throughout the year. The following are the chief points of interest in Mijan:— Name. Position, Nature. Remarks. 'Aqdah At the southern extremity of the tract, 20 or 25 miles south-south-east of 'Aqalat Mijrin. A well. The water is bad. Ba'ajah 3 miles inland, westwards, from Dohat-as-Sila' on the coast. A spring or over flowing well. It is 3 feet deep and is surroun ded by a bed of green grass. Bat-hah About 15 miles south-west by south of Sila'. A well. The water is of indifferent quality. Ghadaiyar- al-Lal 20 or 25 miles south of Sila'. (One authority would make it nearly 30 miles west of Sila'.) Do. The best well in Mijan: the water is sweet and sometimes overflows after rain, but at times it falls to 1 or 2 fathoms below the surface, it is situated in an earthy plain with some scanty scrub. Travellers between 'Oman and Qatar often halt here. Ghuwaifat Near the coast, 10 miles north of Sila'. Do. The water is indifferent in quality. Manaif About 15 miles south-east of 'Aqalat Mijrin. Do. The water is bad. Mijrin ('Aqalat) 35 or 40 miles south-west of Dohat-as-Sila'. Do. The water is good and almost at the ground level. Minba'i About 8 miles west of Sila'. A spring or over flowing well. It resembles Ba'ajah, but is surrounded by shallow pits which also yield water. Sila' About 5 miles inland, south- westwards, from Dohat-as- Sila'. A well. 1 The water is brackish, but is drunk in emergency. The well is under the east face of a stony ridge. * The information contained in this article was supplied by Captain F. B. Prideaux, Agent in Bahrain, in whose Map of Jafurah, etc., the tract in question appears.140 Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Sila' (D5hat-as-) The chief indentation in the coast of Mijan, which it divides from Sabakhat Matti to the eastward; it is about 46 miles south-east by south of the entrance of Khor-al- 'Odaid. A bay. The country in the neighbour hood is desert descending in terraces to the sea. MORRAH The singular is Morri. A considerable Arab tribe, altogether Bedouin, of Eastern Arabia; they are notorious for their misdeeds; but otherwise less is known [pp. 1239-42] them than of any other tribe of equal size and importance in the same region of Arabia. Distribution. —The A1 Morrah inhabit the country in the south of the Hasa Sanjaq and that adjoining it but lying beyond its border on the same side: some are generally to be found in Kharmah near the wells of ZarnOqah; they visit Barr- adh -Dhahran; and their raiders sometimes infest Wadi Faruq. They are the only inhabitants of the Jafurah desert; Jabrin is their property; they sometimes visit Qatar in their peregrinations; and they frequent the district of 'Aqal to a certain extent. A few A1 Morrah are among the Bedouins who resort annually to 'Anik in the Qatif Oasis and who are regarded as having a permanent connection with the place. Religion, character, mode of life and language. —The A1 Morrah are Hanbali Sunnis in name, but concern themselves little with religion. They appear to be the wildest, most dangerous, and least civilised of the nomad tribes in this part of Arabia, and to exist, to an appreciable extent, by plunder. They are said to be staunch friends to those whom they recognise as neighbours; but otherwise they are treacherous and untrustworthy, and they sometimes betray persons who take sanctuary with them. The principal wealth of the Al Morrah is in camels; but they have also some horses and many sheep and goats. Their tents are small and black: some of them have no tents. Of the sections enumerated below only the Al 'Adhbah, Al Bahaih, Al Fahaidah and Al Shabib have either kerchiefs or 'Abas. The tribe as a whole avoid towns and villages. Those of the Al Morrah who enter Jafurah do so in winter, and while there they have often no drink other than the milk of their camels and are reduced to boiling their rice in the same. It is said that the sections which frequent Jafurah wear a specially thick footgear made of camel hair to protect their feet from the burning sand, that their complexion is of a swarthiness unusual among Arabs, and that their camels_are generally dark-coloured. The dialect of Arabic spoken by the Al Morrah is peculiar, and to other Arabs they appear to talk ' in a stammering way.' Divisions and numbers. —The following table contains all that is known about the internal structure of the tribe:— Section. Subsection. Fighting strength. Remarks. 'Ali-bin-Morrah (Al) Ghiyathin 20 Do. Jaraba'ah 25 Do. Nabit (Al) 60 Their Shaikh is 'Ali-bin-Nabit. Bishr (Al) See Al Shabib below. Jabir (Al) Ghadhban (Al) 45 Do. Na'am (Al Bin-) 30 Shabib (Al) or Al Bishr 'Adhbah (Al) 250 The proper Shaikh of this subsection is 'Abdur Rahman-bin-Niqadan, but a num ber of his people live under the Shaikh of the Al Fahaidah.141 Section. Subsection. Fighting strength. Remarks. Shabib (Al) or Al Bishr 'Bahaih (Al) 500 This section, who have acquired an unenvi able reputation by acts of violence commit ted near the coast, are distributed between two Shaikhs, viz., Taithab-bin-Hadi and Muhammad-as-Sa'ak. Do. Buraid (Al) 30 The subsectional Shaikh is Salih-al-Mutawwa' Do. Dawi (Al) 20 Do. Fahaidah (Al) 350 Muhammad-bin-Sharaim, who is Shaikh of this subsection, is paramount Shaikh also of the whole Al Morrah tribe. Do. Ghafran (Al) 500 The present Shaikh is one Bin-Jallab. Do. Hadi (Al) 25 Do. Hasan (Al) 20 Do. Jahaish 35 Do. Shabi'o (Al) 35 Do. Zaqaimah (Al) 25 Do. Zibdan (Al) 30 This gives a total fighting strength of 2,000 men, and the whole number of the tribe may be roughly estimated at 7,000 souls. Political position. —The Al Morrah are at present at feud with the 'Ajman and the Bani Khalid; and difficulties between them and the Turkish administration in the Hasa Sanjaq are chronic. The Al Bahaih subsection are particularly turbulent and obnoxious to their neighbours: in 1900 they massacred a Shaikh of the Bahrain ruling family with a number of followers at the Bin-'Aqdan well in Barr-adh -Dhahran, where he had come for sport; in 1902 they cut up a Turkish force near 'Oqair Port; in 1905 they committed an unprovoked attack on Bahrain boats at Huwaiqil bay in Barr-al -Qarah; and in 1906 they repeated their exploit against the Turks at nearly the same place as in 1902 and in much the same circumstances. The Al Morrah when pressed by enemies more powerful than themselves ordinarily take refuge in the impenetrable Jafurah desert; but in 1902 the Turks, after the 'Oqair outrage, succeeded in surprising a large body of them at the wells of Zarnuqah in Kharmah and inflicted on them a sanguinary defeat. The Amirs of the Wahhabis sent frequent expeditions against the Al Morrah; but one only, led by the Amir Faisal, was partially successful; his forces, however, reached the scene of action in such a feeble state, owing to want of water, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement and returned to Najd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with their postal service in the Hasa Sanjaq the Turks pay small subsidies to the chief Shaikh of the Al Morrah, to the Shaikhs of the Al Adhban and Ghafran subsections, and to Muhammad-as-Sa'ak of the Al Bahaih subsection, but these do not avail to secure the good behaviour ot the tribe, nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. About 186!&gt; the Al Morrah were paying the value of $3,000 as revenue to the Wahhabi Amir, and during the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported the Wahhabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Sa'ud. Or Na'aim: the name is sometimes pronounced with the accent on the first NA'IM syllable, and the singular is Na'aimi. The Na'im are an important Arab tribe [pp. 1301- found chiefly in 'Oman, but partly also in Bahrain and Qatar; these two mam territorial divisions of the Na'im are now in all respects independent ot one another and must be dealt with separately.142 Settled Nairn of Oman. —Settled Na'im are found in Trucial 'Oman, in the 'Oman Sultanate, and also in the neutral autonomous district of Jau which is situated between the two former. The table below explains the distribution of the tribe in this quarter:— Country. Principality or district. Town or village. Number of houses. Trucial 'Oman 'Ajman 'Ajman 25 Do. Sharjah Dhaid 30 Do. Do. Hairah 250 Do. Do. Hamriyah 250 Do. Do. Haqalah 10 Do. Do. Sharjah Town 100 'Oman Sultanate Batinah Sanqar 45 Do. Do. Dhank Town 660 Do. Do. Sanainah 200 Independent 'Oman Jau Baraimi Village 100 Do. Do. Hafit 150 Do. Do. Qabil 180 Do. Do. Su'arah 100 From the figures given it may be inferred that the total number of non-nomadic Na'im in 'Oman is about 10,500 souls, of whom roughly 3,500 belong to Trucial 'Oman, 4,500 to the 'Oman Sultanate, and 2,500 to Independent 'Oman. Bedouin Na'im of 'Oman. —The Bedouin Na'im in 'Oman range over the entire central portion of the 'Oman Promontory towards its base. The district of Jau, in which the Baraimi Oasis is situated, may be regarded as their headquarters; but they are predominant also in the Dhahirah District of the 'Oman Sultanate to the eastwards, and on the west they extend to the district of Khatam which they occupy in common with the Bani Yas and Dhawahir. In winter some of the Na'im pasture their animals on the watershed between the Baraimi Oasis and Sohar, and the Na'im are an important factor in tribal politics at the head of Wadi Hatta; but on the north their principal location is in the plain of Jiri which is shared by their Khawatir section with the Ghafalah tribe. In the direction of Sharjah, the tract known as Gharif was once in their possession; but they were displaced by the Bani Ka'ab, who in their turn had to make way for the Bani Qitab. The number of Na'im Bedouins in 'Oman may be roughly estimated at 2,500 souls, of whom 1,200 may be ordinarily in Truciaf 'Oman, 900 in the 'Oman Sultanate and 400 in Independent 'Oman. Subdivisions of the Na'im of 'Oman—The Na'im of 'Oman, whether settled or nomadic^ all belong to one of two main tribal divisions—the AI Bu Kharaiban and the Al Bu Shamis and each of these again is resolvable into a number of tribal sections. The Al Bu Kharaiban are said to be descended from a common ancestor named Khazraj and the Al Bu Shamis from one 'Aus. The following table contains some of the better known sectional names:— Section. Main division. Location. Remarks. 'Aryan Al Bu Kharaiban. Hafit village in Jau. About 140 souls. In summer they cultivate dates; in winter they roam the desert in tents with their flocks and herds. 'Aziz ('Ayal) Al Bu Shamis. Dhank Town in Dhahirah. About 700 souls: all are townsmen. They are believed not to be really Na'im, but their true origin is for gotten.143 ' Section. Main division. Location. Remarks. Darawishah Do. Hairah, Hamriyah and Sharjah Town in Sharjah, also Ras-al -Khaimah Town. At these places the settled members of this section aggregate more than 1.500 souls. The Shaikhs of Hamriyah and Hairah belong to this section. Dhanain (Al BQ) Al Bu Kharaiban. 'Ajman and else where. About 700_ souls. The name is also given as Al Bu Adhnain. Hamirat Do. Do. This section consists of about 90 towns people and 90 Bedouins. Hiyah ('Aval) Al Bu Shamis. Dhank Town in Dhahirah. The name is also given as Ahiya. They are all townspeople and number about 150 souls. In religion they are Shafi'i Sunnis. Khawatir Al Bu Kharaiban. Hafit village in Jau and the Jiri plain in Sharjah. The Khawatir of the Jiri plain are Bedouins inhabiting black blanket tents; they number about 500 souls and are said to own some 800 camels, 70 donkeys, 100 cattle and 1,500 sheep and goats. Kilabinah Al Bu Shamis. Hafit village in Jau and Sanqar in Batinah. Qaratisah Al Bu Kharaiban. Baraimi Village and Su'arah in the Baraimi Oasis. The Shaikh of 'Ajman belongs to this section. Shawamis Al Bu Shamis. Bizaili and Sanainah in Dhahirah, also Dhank Town. About 1,400 souls, partly Bedouin. A few of the Bedouins affect to be Maliki Sunnis; the remainder of the section are Hanbalis. {N.B. —There is also a Shawamis section of the Bani Kalaib tribe.) Wahaishah Do. Dhank Town in Dhahirah. About 250 souls. Tn religion the majority are Ibadhis, some are Shafi'is, and a few Hanifis. The A1 Bu Kalbi of 'Ajman Town are perhaps another section of the 1 BQA Kharaiban division of this tribe. Political position of the Nairn in 'Oman. —The Baraimi Oasis, where they are still politically though no longer numerically predominant, is regarded by the Nairn of 'Oman as their tribal headquarters; but at 'Ajman and Hamriyah, botn of which places are ruled over by Na'aimi Shaikhs, their position appears to be more secure than it is in Baraimi at the present day. They are also the most powerful Ghafiri tribe in the Dhahirah District of the Oman Sultanate;^ but their relations with the ruler of the Sultanate are slight. Except at 'Ajman and Hamriyah the Nairn appear to be weakened by internal dissensions, but their Bedouins are described as warlike and predatory. In 'Oman the Na im are generally Sunnis of the Hanbali school; one or two exceptions to this rule are noted in the table in the preceding paragraph. Settled Nrf'im of Bahrain.—VJe now turn to the second territorial division of the tribe—a branch severed from the parent trunk some generations ago who are found in Bahrain and Qatar. Tn the region in question non-Bedouin members of the tribe are now found only in the Bahrain islands where they have 60 houses at Umm-ash-Shajar, 50 at Halat-an-Na'im, 30 at Shajairah, 10 at Halat-as-Sulutah and a few at Rifa '-al-Gharbi; they thus number about 800 souls altogether. There are now no settled Na'im in Qatar. _ • , ^ - Bedouin Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar. —The nomadic Na'im outside Oman are believed to number about 2,000 souls. Tn winter they live in Qatar, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Zubarah; in the hot weather most of them remove to Bahrain and form camps in the northern part of the main island, but some take 82385 U144 up their summer quarters near Dohah in the Qatar peninsula. These Bedouins are reputed to possess altogether about 100 horses, 600 camels, 1 000 sheen and 1,000 goats. P Subdivisions of the Nairn of Bahrain and Qatar. —The main tribal divisions of the Na'im are the same here as in the south, namely, the A1 Bu Kharaiban and the A1 B0 Shamis; but the prominent sections appear to be entirely different They are— Al Bu Kharaiban. Jifafalah Khaluwi Matawa'ah AI Bu Shamis. Fahad (Al) Haiyi (Al) Hutum Jabar (Al) Miza'idah and Qahatin Jima'an (Al) Ramadhan (Al) and Suwawarah These sections, and even the two main divisions, are here much intermingled* but all the tribesmen in Bahrain and ()atar are followers of one of two Shaikhs who belong to the Al Haiyi and Al Ramadhan sections respectively. The Muraikhat of Bahrain are sometimes regarded as a section of the Al Bu Shamis division of the Na'im, with whom they are at least intimately connected; but it appears preferable to treat them as a separate tribe. The Na'im of Bahrain speak of the Shaikh of 'Ajman as a Jaffali, and it is therefore possible that the Jifafalah section among the Na'im of the north corresponds to the Qaratisah section among those of the south. Political position of the Nairn in Bahrain and Qatar.—The Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar are now completely detached from the main body of the tribe in 'Oman and maintain no relations with the latter. They believe that their ancestors immigrated from 'Oman several generations ago a_t the invitation of the 'Utub, then in Qatar, for the purpose of expelling the Al Musallam. Some of these northern Na'im have become pearl divers, but the majority are still pastoral and depend for subsistence upon their livestock. The Bedouins of the northern Na'im are retained as mercenaries both by the Shaikh of Bahrain and by the Al Thani Shaikhs of D5hah, and the protection of those Shaikhdoms is considered to devolve pnnapaHy upon them during the absence from home of the pearl fleets. Their efficiency and trustworthiness are not however beyond doubt, and their presence in Bahrain in summer is a source of annoyance to the peaceable agriculturists of other tribes. In Bahrain and Qatar the Na'im are Maliki Sunnis. /^ hoi P at ^ .

An abstract of the then existing information concerning trucial 'Oman was completed by the writer in November 1904 from all available books and reports; it amounted to 17 printed foolscap pages and was only intended to serve as a basis for further investigation. Early in 1905 the writer visited Sharjah Town, where with the assistance of Mr J C. Gaskin, Uncovenanted Political Assistant in the Persian Gulf, and of'Abdul Latif, Residency A^ent at Sharjah, he was able to collect a quantity of fresh information. A series of articles prepared from the material thus obtained was ready in January 1906 and filled 55 octavo pages of print; this draft was circulated to the local officers whose attention it engaged during the whole of 1906. The greater part of the work of revision and amplification fell on Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf who in July 1906 paid a special visit to Fujairah, and on K. B. 'Abdul Latif-bin-'Abdur Rahman, Residency Agent at Sharjah, who undertook such of the inquiries as Major Cox was unable to carry out personally. In the next set of drafts, which appeared early in 1907 and extended to over 120 octavo pages of print, were incorporated the results of an important journey made by Major Cox in December 1905 from Ras-al -Khaimah Town to the Baraimi Oasis; also those of careful inquiries by the same officer regarding the Dhafrah tract; new data relating to communications obtained by Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel at the end of 1905; the facts contained in a series of useful reports by Captain F B Prideaux, Political Aeent in Bahrain, on the whole coastal region between Qatar and Abu Dhabi Town- the observations of Commander W. S. Bowman of H.M.S. ' Sphinx ' on the islands of Ba Musa 'and Tunb, recorded after a visit to the same; and some remarks by Captain A. P. Trevor, Assistant Resident, on the islands of Tunb and Nabiyu Tunb, also founded on a personal inspection. For discussions of the ancient geography Sprenger's Alte Geographic Arabiens, 1875, and Miles Note on Pliny's Geography of the East Coast of Arabia, 1875, may be consulted. The principal authority in regard to the geography of Trucial 'Oman has hitherto been the Persian Gulf Pilot, 1898, in which the coast and all maritime features are fully described, but little is said of the interior; similarly restricted in its scope, for the most part, is the older information contained in Bombay Selections XXIV, 1856. Valuable though early authorities on the country are Whitelock's Account of the Arabs, etc., and his Description of the Arabian Coast, 1836-38 the former of which is occupied largely with the subject of population. Trade, as it was in 1863, and questions of local resources, taxation, etc., are fully dealt with by Pelly in his Report on the Tribes, etc., around the Shores of the Persian Gulf, 1863, in which some older statistics for 1826 and 1831 are also quoted Recent topographical and other information regarding the interior is due almost entirely to ^ la J or P.

Amons the subjects of the 'Oman Sultanate the whole is known as Shamal, either on account of its position with reference to their own country or because of its exposure to the north-west wind; and in Eastern Arabia, further to the northward, the part adjoining Abu Dhabi Town seems to be spoken of as 'Oman-ash-Shamali because it is the northernmost part of 'Oman; but neither of these terms is in common use among the inhabitants of the regions which they used to describe. The nearest approach to a recognised general designation is apparently Sahil 'Oman or Coast of 'Oman; but this expression, though not unknown to the people of the country, is wanting in precision and distinctiveness and is far from beins universally understood. In English official literature a part of the shore line has long been familiar under the name of ' The Pirate Coast '; but the term is not sufficiently comprehensive, and, at the present day, is obsolete and even misleading inasmuch as the state of affairs which it once accurately connoted has lon^ since passed away. Regard being had to a perpetual maritime truce which regulates the relations of the rulers to one another and to the British Government the pentarchy in question may be styled, not inappropriately, Trucial 'Oman*- but it must be remembered that the trucial obligations of the Shaikhs do not extend to the interior of their dominions. The component principalities of Trucial 'Oman are fully described elsewhere under their own names; and the function of the present article is accordingly to correlate them, to describe the country and its inhabitants as a whole and to dispose ot certain matters (such as communications) which could not be dealt with piecemeal under the names of the separate principalities. Upon the coast, Trucial 'Oman extends in the Gulf of 'Oman from Khoi Kalba to Dibah, and in the Persian Gulf from Sha'am to Khor-al -'Odaid the places named being all included in it; in other words its boundary between t lese two sets of points is the sea. Inland, its frontiers are more difficult to define- but it covers a considerable portion of the interior of the 'Oman Promontory.' On one side there it is bounded by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages of Dibah and Bai'ah on the east coast to Ras yw 111 \ We 5 C r aSt ' ar ; d S0 divides i 1 from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate to the north; on another by a line, even more indeterminate which leaves the Gulf between Khor Kalba and Murair and, after partially crossing he promontory m such a way as to exclude the Mahadhah and Jau districts to Tmrf^ 'nm- eVentU t a t y in Khatam ' Westwards of Khatam the inland limit of irucial Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba'-al-Khali and Jafiirah deserts.

In this direction most of the space between the coast and the 20 fathom line,—which runs approximatelv from opposite Sharjah Town to the tip of the Qatar peninsula,—is occupied by pearl banks. Full details of these banks are given in the Appendix on the Pearl Fisheries. A number of islands are associated with the coast of Trucial 'Oman, the most important being BQ Musa, Tunb, Sir BQ Na'air, Yas and Dalmah; the last of these is adjoined by a number of others which are enumerated in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, and by Shura'awah. Inland plain of Trucial 'Oman. —The interior of a country so extensive naturally varies in character from one part to another, but, attention being for the moment confined to the non-mountainous portions, the variations are found to be less considerable than might have been expected. Almost the whole consists of sandy desert; uncultivable but not altogether destitute of natural vegetation or even of wood; the principal exceptions to the general infertility are the Jiri plain, the plain of Dhaid and the Liwah division of the Dhafrah tract, in all of which some cultivation, at least of dates, is carried on. These relatively small districts are fully described in the articles under the names indicated, and it is unnecessary to enter here upon the exceptional features which they present. Another tract of a different nature, which has no general name and which it is consequently impossible to make the subject of an article, is described below in the paragraph on the topography of Trucial 'Oman. The only remaining portion of the country is that which lies between the sea and an imaginary line joining Ras-al -Khaimah Town to the Baraimi Oasis: it ends southwards in the district of Khatam which is elsewhere described under its own name. So far as can be ascertained this portion, from Ras-al -Khaimah as far south as Dibai Town, is not entirely composed of sand dunes, but contains also level shingly plains with sparse acacia vegetation; southwards from Dibai the whole surface appears to be sandy and undulating, but desert vegetation and wells and water holes are still sufficiently plentiful to support a scanty Bedouin population. In the whole of this region no running water is found except in one subterranean aqueduct which irrigates the settlement of Falai; but there are numerous wells, sunk generally on the banks or in the beds of dry watercourses, and sometimes in spots which from their elevated position might have been supposed unsuitable for the purpose. On the Ras-al -Khaimah- Baraimi route these wells are generally from 40 to 60 feet deep and are lined tor 8 or 10 feet near the surface with timber or rough-hewn stones brought from the hills. Acacias, which are the commonest kind of tree, are of the Ghaf and Samr varieties; the Ashkar shrub, the Markh bush, and grass of the kind called Arta are frequently met with; and the dwarf tamarisk, the wild castor oil plant, and a bulbous grass called Qufa are also found. Other sorts of vegetation which afiord grazing are Rimth, a species of Salsola which, when green, is eaten by camels; Halam, a small sand plant; Thamam, a coarse grass which eventually dries up into twigs and becomes inedible; and Qasad, a small vivid green shrub ol the caper tribe: the last three are eaten by livestock of all kinds. There is also a bright green edible weed, somewhat resembling mignonette, which is called Haram. Hills of Trucial 'Oman. —The only mountainous part of the country is in the east, where a section of the spinal range of the 'Oman Promontory is included, this section is the part between a line joining Dibah to Sha'am on the north, and another, on the south, which runs inland from Khor Kalba, first westwards then southwards, so as to curve round the northern and western sides of the Mahadhah tract and the hills connected with it. The hill tract of Trucial Oman is thus about 50 miles in extent from north to south, and its average breadth seems to be about 20 miles. It is still almost entirely unexplored, the only part of it as yet traverse148 by Europeans being that which lies on the direct route, through Wadi-al -Qaliddi, between Dibah and Ras-al -Khaimah; and even of this part no account appears to be extant. As seen from the west, from the Ras-al -Khaimah-Baraimi route, the mountains appear to be disposed in three more or less parallel ridges running from north to south: of these the westernmost terminates at a hill called Qumr immediately behind the village of Adhan; and the second ridge, after curving slightly westwards, seems to continue the interrupted line of the first. The third or easternmost ridge contains the highest peaks and probably overlooks the Gulf of 'Oman: one of these high peaks, situated apparently 12 to 15 miles east of Adhan, is said to be named Jabal Sa'ta. It is possible, however, that these three ridges are apparent only, and that the hill system is more complex than from the west it seems to be. As Adhan in the Jiri plain is considered to be a village of Wadi Ham, it may be inferred that this valley pierces the whole mass of mountains from side to side and even conveys part of the drainage of the south end of the Jiri plain to the Gulf of 'Oman at Fujairah; but it has not been found possible to locate with certainty the true head of Wadi Ham: in any case, however, its average direction appears to be from north-west to south-east, and not from west to east as has hitherto been generally supposed. Wadi-al -Qor, further south than Wadi Ham, is the only other considerable valley that comes down to the sea from the hills of Trucial 'Oman on their eastern side. The drainage from the western slope of the hills never, apparently, reaches the Persian Gulf, but is swallowed up by the intervening sands. Climate. —The climate of Trucial 'Oman in winter is pleasantly cool by day and cold at night, but frost is unknown: on the coast, in the same season, the weather is often boisterous. Between May and October the climate is excessively hot and trying; and during the worst of the heat, that is from May to September, travellers journey by night as much as possible. The rainfall is scanty and is believed to average about 5 inches a year. Most of the rain is received in mid winter, but there are also occasional showers in spring. Population and tribes. —The people of Trucial 'Oman belong to numerous distinct tribes; indeed, the country is tribally one of the most composite and perplexing in the Persian Gulf. The comprehensive ' Joasmee ' tribe, assumed by some writers, has no real existence. Only the members of the family of the Shaikh of Sharjah, numbering at the present day about 20 adult males, are Qawasim (Jawasim) by blood; and the use of the name to denote all subjects of the Sharjah Shaikh, though partially sanctioned by local practice, is really incorrect. The following is a synopsis of the principal tribes of Trucial 'Oman:— Tribe. Singular. Settled in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Bedouins in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Location. Remarks. 'Abadilah 'AbdQli. 1,150 See article 'Abadilah. 'Ali (Al) 'Aliyi. 6,750 See article Al 'Ali. 'Amim (Al Bu) 'Amimi. 120 Abu Dhabi Town. Originally, it is said, Bani Tamim; but now practically merged in the Bani Yas. 'Awamir 'Amid. Uncer tain and fluctu ating. None in parti cular. See article 'Awamir. Some of the tribe come as far west as Sharjah Town in spring for the sake of the grazing. 'Awanat 'Awani. 50 Khatt in the Jiri plain Dibah and Jazirat-al- Hamra. This tribe is now practically ex tinct; and, according to some, those who remain are not genuine 'Awanat. Some say that the 'Awanat were slaves of the Qawasim; others that they were connected with the Maqabil. Baharinah Bahrani. 600 Abu Dhabi and Dibai Towns. See article Baharinah.149 Tribe. Singular. Settled in Trucial 'Oman (souls). 1 Bedouins in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Location. ■ Remarks. Dahailat Ad-haili. 200 Abu Dhabi Town. By some regarded as a section of the Al Bu Mahair. Dahaminah Dahmani. 150 Raha, Fashrah and Nuslah in Wadi-al -Qor; also Manai'i in the neighbour hood of the same valley. Sunnis and belong to the Ghafiri faction. Dhababihah Adhbaihi. 200 Wadi Sfuni and its branch Wadi Naidain. The descent of this tribe is un known; they arc said to be aboriginal. Ghafalah Ghafaili. 500 See article Ghafalah. Halalamah Hallami, 75 Abu Dhabi Town. Formerly a section of the Bani Qitab, but now attached to the Bani Yas. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. Hamid (Bani) A few. Hair in Shamai- liyah. Huwalah Holi. 1,500 Sharjah Town. See article Huwalah. Jalajilah Jalaijali. 50 Furfar and Hail in Shamai- liyah; also Induk in Wadi Nuslah, a side valley of Wadi- al -Qor. The tribe is divided in allegiance between the Shaikh of Sharjah and the rebel Shaikh of Fu- jairah. The name is generally pronounced Yalayilah. Kaibi (Al Bu) Kalbani. 70 'Ajman Town. Perhaps a section of the Al Bu Kharaiban section of the Na'im Khaimah (Ahl Ras-al-) 2,000 Ras-al -Khai- mah Town. Khamarah ... 375 Abu Dhabi Town. Originally from Khamir in Persia. They are Malikis by religion and claim to be connected with the 'Utub. Kunud Mahair (Al Bu) Kindi. Mahairi. 150 5,500 100 See article Kunud. See article Al Bu Mahair. Maharah Mahri. 1,250 Ras-al -Khaimah Town. The origin of this tribe is obscure; they appear to have some con nection with the Za'ab, and according to a local tradition they are of the same stock as Mir Mahanna, the celebrated pirate of Rig in the 18th century. Maharizah Mahairizi. 250 Msaafi and Tai- yibah in Wadi Ham. Originally the Maharizah may have been a section of the Sharqiyin; but it is admitted that in that case they have now seceded and become a separate tribe. Manasir Mansuri. 100 1,300 See article Manasir. Marar Marri. 1,350 350 See article Marar.150 Tribe. Singular. Settled in Trucial 'Oman i (souls). Bedouim in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Location. Remarks. Maibah 25 'Ajman Town. These are an off-shoot of the Na'im with an admixture of negro blood. Matarish Matrushi. 1,000 Sharjah Town. This tribe are found also in the Batinah district of the 'Oman Sultanate. Mazarl' Mazru'i. 1,400 See article Mazari'. Those of the tribe who are clearly considered to be a section of the Bani Yas are excluded here. Na'Im Na'aimi. 3,500 See article Na'im. Naqbiyin Naqbi. 1,800 See article Naqbiyin. Nasir (Al Bin) Nasiri. 120 Abu Dhabi Town. These are said to be of the same stock as the Baharinah, but they are Sunnis by religion. Qawaid Qaidi. 250 At and in the neighbour hood of Shokah in Wadi Ham. By some they are believed to be an offshoot of the Mazari', but this is doubtful. They own about 10 camels and 150 sheep and goats; but they also culti vate a little, and some of their number are semi-settled. Qawasim Qasimi. 60 See article Qawasim. Qitab (Bani) Qitbi. 200 2,100 See Article Bani Qitab. Shahairah Ashhari. 125 ... ' A s i m a h in Wadi Ham. There is also a singular Shahyari. The Shahairah are considered to be aboriginal. Shamaili (Bani) Shamaili. 1,000 Shimil in Sir. The Bani Shamaili are said to have been originally Jews (sic), but now they are closely con nected with the Shihuh and may almost be regarded as a section of that tribe, though not inclu ded in either of its 2 main divi sions. They are also called Shamaiiyin. A few of them who are nomadic are found among the Shihuh in the Ruus- al-Jibal district of the 'Oman Sultanate. Shaqosh 'Ajman Town. The Shaqosh are a section of the Bani Ma'fn of Qishm. Sharqiyin Sharqi. 7,000 See article Sharqiyin. Shihuh Shihhi. 2,500 See article Shihuh. Shwaihiyin 2,050 Dibai and Shar jah Towns. This tribe are apparently identical with the section similarly named of the Bani Ka'ab, with which tribe they still inter-marry, but in this Gazetteer they have not been included among the latter. In religion they are Hanbalis. Sudan Suwaidi. 5,000 See article Sudan. Tanaij Tanaiji. 2,500 1,500 1 See article Tanaij.151 Tribe. Singular. Settled in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Bedouins in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Location. Remarks. Thamairat Thamiri. 120 Abu Dhabi Town. The Thamairat were originally Marar, but they are now reckoned among the Bani Yas. Yas (Bani) Yasi. 10,000 2,000 See article Bani Yas. Za'ab Za'abi. 3,500 See article Za'ab. Zahum Zahmi. 100 Siji near Wadi Ham. They are said to have been for merly Sharqiyin of the Hafaitat section, but at the present time they are undoubtedly a distinct tribe. Besides the foregoing there are about 1,400 Baluchis at Dibai Town, Ghallah and Ras-al -Khaimah ; 194 Hindus at Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Umm-al -Qaiwain and Sharjah Towns; 214 Khojahs or other Indian Muhammadans at Dibai, Ras-al- Khaimah and Sharjah Towns; and Persians, some Arabicised and some not, about 2,400 at Abu Dhabi and Dibai Towns, Khor Fakkan and Ghallah. Negro slaves are exceptionally numerous in the coast towns, but no separate estimate of them is possible and they may be taken as included in our tables among the Arabs to whom they belong. The Indians are not domiciled nor accompanied by their families. Here it may be useful to mention that the Bayadir found in Sir, at Dibah, and elsewhere, e.g., at Khasab in Ruus-al -Jibal, are not a tribe but a class,— the class namely of the agricultural labourer to whatever tribe he may belong. The singular of the name is Baidar. The total number of Bedouins in Trucial 'Oman may be estimated in accordance with the table above at about 8,000 souls. In respect of settled population, however, the table is not exhaustive, and recourse must be had to the articles upon the principalities, from which it will appear that the figures are:— Principality. Settled inhabitants. 'Ajman ... ... ... ... ... 750 Dhabi (Abu) Dibai... Qaiwain (Umm-al-) Sharjah 11.000 10,250 5,000 45.000 Total for Trucial'Oman ... ... 72,000 By far the strongest numerically of the settled tribes are the Bani Yas, whose Bedouins also are the most numerous of any except the Bani Qitab. Next after the Bani Yas there rank, in point of _numbers among the settled^ tribes, first the Sharqiyin and A1 'All, and then the A1 Bu Mahair and the Sudan. Political and religious distinctions. —Like the people of the 'Oman Sultanate those of Trucial 'Oman are divided between the Hinawi and Ghafiri political factions, but Ghafiriyah greatly predominate, the Bani Yas and the Shihuh alone being Hinawi; and, whereas in the Sultanate the Hinawiyah are mostly Ibadhis and the Ghafiriyah mostly Sunnis by religion, here the Hinawiyah are all Sunms of the Maliki school while the Ghafiriyah are virtual Wahhabis. The Wahhabnsm of Trucial 'Oman is not now, however, of the militant order; it is generally described as Sunniism of the orthodox school of Ibn Hanbal, and it even connives at the private consumption of tobacco, though not as yet at the public sale ot the same. Modern rifles are widely distributed among the people in both town and country. Character, life and language. —The people of the western coast, at least those of the more northern parts, have shown themselves in the past a bold and energetic race. By their piratical exploits at the beginning of the 9th century they gained, under the misleading name of ' Joasmees,' a permanent place in history, an d they played a large part in the politics of the Persian Coast, especially ot Qishm 82385 X152 island, and in those of Bahrain and the 'Oman Sultanate. At the present day they lead a quiet and unobtrusive existence, but doubtless the old qualities are latent in them still. The well-to-do classes on the coast of Trucial 'Oman have three meals a day; the first, called Fakk-ar-Riq, or ' Loosening of the Spittle,' is a kind of breakfast and consists sometimes of pancakes made of eggs, rice flour and sugar; the other two meals, at noon and evening, comprise rice with fish or meat, accompanied by dates and thin cakes of white bread. Coffee is drunk several times a day. Virtually the whole free population is Arab, and Arabic is almost the only language spoken. Swahili, however, survives among negro slaves of the full blood. Occupations and resources. —Pearl diving is, since the suppression of piracy, the principal and almost the sole occupation of the maritime population. In summer most of the able-bodied men, to the number of more than 22,000, are absent at the pearl banks; and the coast towns and villages are left to a great extent unprotected and deserted. The number of pearl boats in Trucial 'Oman is approximately 1,215, carrying on the average crews of about 18 men each: they are distributed as follows:— In winter some of the pearl diving class take part in the ordinary sea fisheries, but the majority of them spend the season at home in idleness, supported by boat owners and contractors who thereby acquire, under the stringent rules of the industry, an indefeasible lien on their services for the next pearling season. A few of the seafaring class are employed on the cargo vessels mentioned in the paragraph on shipping below. Fish are everywhere plentiful and excellent, and turtle are caught upon the islands.* The settled population who do not live by the sea are herdsmen and agricul turists: to this class belong most of the non-nomads of the interior and of the eastern side of the 'Oman Promontory. The agricultural capabilities of the country are, however, very limited; and cereals, such as wheat and jowari, are grown only in a few favoured localities such as Sir and the Shamailiyah district. Dates flourish in most places; but on the west coast south of Ras-al -Khaimah Town they never fully ripen, tor want of water, and are eaten fresh. Vegetables are raised at most places by means of well irrigation. Livestock are chiefly camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, and there is plenty of poultry; but horses are few in consequence of the difficulty of feeding them; the last are kept on barley and desert grass, with occasionally a little lucerne, which in places is grown among the date groves. The Bedouins depend chiefly on their livestock for subsistence, but some of them take part in the pearl fisheries. In winter, when the weather is cool and grazing abundant, they are scattered far and wide in small parties; but, as water and pasture become scarce with the approach of summer, they congregate in larger bodies around the more copious wells in the less inhospitable parts of the country. Favourite Bedouin summer resorts of this kind are the Jiri plain in the north and Bainunah in the west. They own many camels and a number of donkeys; but the latter are used only for work in the neighbourhood of the camps, and not for long caravan journeys. Foreign trade. —Commercial statistics are available only for the larger towns on the western side of the 'Oman Promontory, and so much of the foreign trade ol the country as is carried on from the Shamailiyah coast escapes observation: the amount of this trade is probably inconsiderable, but the fact of its non-inclusion should be borne in mind. Scrutiny of the trade statistics shows how artificial is the existence of the larger coast settlements of Trucial 'Oman and how entirely dependent they are on the proceeds of the pearl fishery for the means of purchasing the ordinary necessaries of life, which they do not themselves produce. Pearls are the only export of any magnitude, and the average annual value of those sent abroad (almost entirely to India) during the last seven years has been 67 lakhs of rupees: the second export in value is that of mother-of-pearl shell, Principality.

Dibai is now the chief pearl mart of the Persian Gulf after Bahrain and occupies in this respect the place formerly held by Lingeh; it has also supplanted Lingeh as the distributing centre for imported goods on the Arabian coast between Ruus-al-Jibal and Qatar. The following are the chief imports with the average annual value of each during the past septennium (in lakhs of rupees):—grain and pulse, chiefly from Persia and India, 12^; cotton piece-goods, from India, 4; dates and date juice, mostly from Turkish 'Iraq, 3; coffee, from India, 2f; from Persia, 2; and sugar, from or through India, 1 miscellaneous provisions, Considerable amounts of specie also pass in both directions. In face of the facts it does not seem unreasonable to hold that all sources of profit here are subsidiary to pearl diving, and that if the pearl banks were to fail this coast would shortly be depopulated. Shipping. —Dibai is the only steam port of Trucial 'Oman. Ten years ago Dibai was almost unvisited by European vessels, but in 1905-06 the number of steamers calling had risen to 34, all British, with a tonnage of 70,132; the progress of the place is a consequence of the decline of Lingeh, The number of native sailing vessels,—other than pearl boats, coasters and fishing boats,—owned in the ports of Trucial 'Oman is about 90, distributed as follows:— Bidyah Dhabi (Abu) Town Dibai T own Fakkan (Khor) Ghallah 10 10 20 5 10 Khaimah (Ras-al-) Town .. Qaiwain (Umm-al-) Town Rams and Sharjah Town 15 1 1 18 The majority appear to be Sambuks, but a proportion of them are Baghlahs, and there are some jollyboats and Badans: these vessels are chiefly employed in running to India and ports of the Persian Gulf for supplies. The statistics of pearl boats are given in the Appendix on the pearl fisheries. Fishing boats not also used as pearlers appear to be roughly equal in number to pearl boats, but they are often extremely small. Jazirat-al -Hamra and Sha'am, though they have no large vessels, possess some coasters of a useful size. Internal trade and manufactures. —Inland traffic is petty and is chiefly with the Bedouin tribes; but Sharjah, Dibai and Abu Dhabi divide with Sohar Town in the 'Oman Sultanate the trade, such as it is, of the Baraimi Oasis. Local manufactures are few and none of them are exported. ^ Fine sheep wool 'Abas are made at Sharjah Town, and daggers at Ras-al -Khaimah. A certain number of sailing vessels are built, chiefly at Umm-al -Qaiwain; the average numbers launched annually are about 20 at that place, 10 at Dibai and 5 at Sharjah Town. Topography. —The topography of nearly the whole of Trucial 'Oman is explained in the articles on the five principalities of which it consists, and in the various subsidiary articles to which clues are given in the articles on the princi palities. Some additional facts may be learned from the paragraph on communi cations which follows below. It only remains to deal in this place with the topography of a small land locked tract which does not apparently belong to any one of the principalities in particular, and which has no general name; the centre of this tract is approximately the Madam plain which lies about 40 miles inland, south-eastwards, from Sharjah Town. The principal points of the tract in question are as follows*: Name. Position. Character. Remarks. 'Aiyoh 'Anaij (Ram!at) In the centre of the Madam plain. 20 miles south of Aiyoh. A single well, lined at the top with timber. A narrow strip of rolling sand hills. The site is surrounded by acacias. This tract lies east and west across the route from Ras-al -Khaimah Town to the Baraimi Oasis. * Authority. —Major P. Z. Cox from personal observation and inquiry- Most of the places mentioned in this table are shown in the map Route taken by Major P. Z. Cox, etc., lyio. 82385 X 2154 Name.

(The exact position is 24° 42' 18' north by 55° 49' 26' east.) Its centre is about 40 miles south-east of Sharjah Town. 8 to 11 miles south of Dhaid village. Character. A group of water holes. A well. A range of hills, reaching a height of about 1,000 feet; it runs north and south with a length of about 12 miles, and is roughly parallel to the main range of the 'Oman Promontory about 20 miles to the eastward of it. A well similar to that of Hamdah. A single well about 40 feet deep and timber-lined at the top. A well wooded strip of plain, 1^ to 2 miles in breadth, between Jabal Samaini and the right bank of Wadi Samaini. A wooded plain several miles in diameter and containing various wells among them those of 'Aiyoh, Musaifi and Yidaiyah. A stony plateau without water or grazing, about 20 feet higher than the country immediately to the north of it and 550 to 600 feet above sea level. It runs west and east and is 3 miles broad from north to south. Remarks. The site is a blind re entrant among sandhills, forming a branch of Wadi Samaini. It is situated a little to the west of ordinary route between Ras-al -Khaimah Town and the Baraimi Oasis. At the northern extremity of Jabal Faiyah are two fantastic rocks forming landmarks. They are known as Zibb-al-'Azab, and Khadkat-al-Jariyah, names of which the meanings are apparently obscene. This well is on the ordinary route via Wadi Hatta from Dibai to Shinas Town. See article Gharif. It is on the north bank of a hollow which forms the southern border of Qallah Mahafidh. The name means ' the Gazelle's Bound.' The place is also called Khasaib. The plain is enclosed by the south end of Jabal Faiyah on the north, by Jabal Rodhah on the north-east, and by the northern part of Jabal Samaini on the east; on the west it is divided by Wadi Yidaiyah from a tract of sandhills. Madam is a camping ground of nomadic Na'Im connected with the Baraimi Oasis. This plain slopes down gently from the base of Jabal Faiyah on the west to the foot of the main range of the 'Oman Promontory on the east, and it also declines gradually from north to south. The soil is sound and hard, consisting of black sand and shingle; near to Jabal Faiyah the sand is coarse and boulders take the place of shingle.155 Name. Position. Character. Remarks. Musaifi (Yahfar) On the northern edge of the Madam plain, 2 miles west of Jabal Rodhah. A well. There is only a single boring. At the top it is lined with timber. Rodhah (Jabal) About 4 miles north-east of the middle of the Madam plain. A detached hill about 1,500 feet high. It forms a fine bluff peak. Samaini (Jabal) On the west side of the tract under considera tion, from the Madam plain in the north to the southern extremity. A hogbacked range run ning north and south for a distance of about 20 miles, and attaining in one place an altitude of about 2,000 feet. This range is parallel to, but appears to be separated by an interval from, the main range of the 'Oman Promontory, which is to the east of it. Samaini (Wadi) In the southern part of the tract now in question. A broad drainage hollow, enclosing the plain of Haza'-adh-Dhabi be tween itself and Jabal Samaini, and contain ing further down the water holes of Badu'. Ft emerges from a V-shaped gap near the south end of Jabal Samaini and runs first 4 miles west wards, then 7 miles northwards, and then westwards again to the desert. Sanaibil (Bat-hah) Forms the southern boundary of the tract under consideration. An ordinary drainage hollow or water scour. It comes from the neigh bourhood of Jabal Khadhra (which is con nected with Mahadhah) on the east and goes westwards to the desert. The well of Dhakhar is on its right bank. Yidaiyah (Wadi) Along the western border of the Madam plain. A fine Bat-hah or Wadi which descends, in this part of its course, from south to north. On its right bank is the well of Yidaiyah, lined with wood like that of Masaifi. Communications. —The principal routes of Trucial 'Oman may be divided into three groups, viz., (1) those which lead across the 'Oman Promontory from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of 'Oman, (2) those which connect the western coast of the 'Oman Promontory with the Baraimi Oasis, and (3) those which run westwards through Dhafrah, providing access from the eastern parts of Trucial 'Oman and from the Baraimi Oasis to Qatar and the Hasa Sanjaq. We proceed to deal with them in the above order. _ 1 {a). Route from Ras-al-Khaimah Town to Dibah* —The places first passed are Falaiyah, Hail and Khatt in Sir, which are reached at 6, 7 and 14 miles, respectively, from Ra-al -Khaimah Town. About li miles beyond Khatt the hills of the 'Oman Promontory are entered; and from this point the way lies up Wadi- al -Qaliddi to a pass near Muhtarqah village; the chief points passed between Khatt and Muhtarqah are given as Labanah, Saram, and Tuwiyain, which are watering places, and the village of Ya'akal. From the pass near Muhtarqah, which is about half way from Khatt to Dibah and has good water, the route descends towards Dibah; and at five miles short of that place it emerges from the hills, continuing for the rest of the way over a plain grown with brushwood. The journey was performed (in the reverse direction to that described) by Colonel Disbrowe and Captain Powell in 1865, apparently in eight stages, but most of these were extremely short. The direct distance between the termini seems to be less than 25 miles, but the actual distance is probably about 40: the general direction is, roughly, from west-north-west to east-south-east. 1 {h). Route from 'Umm-al-Qaiwain Town to Fujairah.] —This route runs across the desert by the wells of Muwaih, Ghara, and Umm-an-Naghul to the * Authorities. —Partly Major P. Z. Cox from native information. Colonel H. Disbrowe, Political Agent, and Captain W. Powell, I .N., travelled this way in 1865; a sketch of the route by the latter is extant, but the report, if any existed, is now lost. u ^ u • i t From native information obtained by Major P. Z. Cox and Lieutenant C. H. Gabnei. 82385 X 3156 inland village of Falaj A1 'Ali (or Falai), which is a dependency of Umm-al ;Qaiwain and 16 miles distant, south-eastwards, from the same. From Falaj A1 'Ali it continues 8 miles further, south-eastwards, to the Muraqqibat wells in the vicinity of Dhaid. It then enters the hills, passes by Siji, and drops into Wadi Ham which it follows down to Fujairah. This route is said to present no difficulties to camel transport: its length, were it straight, would be under 60 miles, but in consequence of windings it is probably a good deal more than this. The average direction is nearly south-east. 1 (c). Route from Sharjah Town to Murair* —The first part of this route lies over open desert by the wells of Zibair and Tahil to Dhaid village, a distance of about 30 miles. From Dhaid it runs to the wells of Wushah, and thereafter it enters Wadi-al -Qor, which it descends to Murair. It is asserted by native informants that Wadi-al -Qor has easy gradients and could probably be made practicable for wheeled traffic without great difficulty, but the statement must be treated with reserve. The distance direct from Sharjah Town to Murair is under 70 miles, but by road it must be considerably more. The general direction is about south-east by east. The part of this route beyond Dhaid may be used also by travellers from Hamriyah and Umm-al -Qaiwain, those from Hamriyah making direct for Dhaid (25 miles) by the wells of Sirrah and Rafi'ah, and_ those from Umm-al -Qaiwain following route No. 1 {b) above as far as Falaj A1 'Ali and then diverging to Dhaid (9 miles from Falaj A1 'Ali). 1 {d). Route from Dihai Town to Shinas Town* —This route crosses the desert behind Dibai Town by the wells of Matinah, Khawanij, Muhdathah, and Ghattah or Qatta; passing over (or through) Jabal Faiyah it arrives at the well of Yahfar- al-Faiyah, 37 miles in a direct line from Dibai. It then falls into Wadi Hatta which it follows down to Shinas. The actual distance in travelling must exceed by a good deal the distance in a straight line—which is a little over 80 miles— between the extreme points. The average direction is south-east by east. Travellers from Sharjah Town to Shinas may also avail themselves of this route, joining it at Ghattah or at Yahfar-al-Faiyah. 2 (a). Route from Ras-al-Khaimah Town to the Baraimi Oasis.] —This route can be most conveniently described in tabular form, as follows:— Starting point. Halting place. Character of halting place. Ras-al -Khai mah Town. Hadaithah Hadaithah. See article Jiri. Faraikh. See article Dhaid. Description of the intermediate stage. The total distance by road is 18 miles and the general direction south by west. The route runs 2 miles south-westwards along the spit of sand upon which the town is situated; then turns the head of the harbour and goes eastwards over sandhills for 14- miles, after which it drops into the Sir plain. The villages of Falaiyah, Hail and Fahlain, on the east, are passed at 6,7 and 8 miles. Just beyond Fahlain the Jiri plain is entered and the route follows its western edge, the sand dunes of the desert being close upon the right, by the wells of Bu Ya'ilan at 14, and those of Ham- raniyah at 16 miles. The distance is 18 miles by road, and the direction is on the average south by west. The route con tinues to follow the western margin of the Jiri plain and passes the wells of Sa'adi at 5 miles. At 1 U miles a high undulating tract of sand is entered, which continues for 4 miles and in which a winding course must be pursued. The remain der of the way lies down the sandy valley of Faraikh. * Authorities. —The same as for route No. 1 (b). t Authority.—Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from personal observation in a report submitted with his letter No. 1800 of 5th August 1906 to the Government of India.157 Starting point. Halting place. Character of halting place. Description of the intermediate stage. Faraikh Qallah Mahafidh. See paragraph on topography above. The distance by road is 15 miles and the direction nearly due south. The Faraikh valley is followed for 2 miles, after which Wadi Manghol (the northern boundary of the Dhaid plain) is crossed and the plain of Dhaid entered. Dhaid village is reached at a little over 5 miles. For 2 miles beyond the village the route lies over the open plain: it then drops into the bed of Wadi Kathairah, which it follows for 2 miles to the wells of Wushah; it then cuts across another stretch of plain and at 13 miles reaches the ascent to Qallah Mahafidh. Just before this ascent is reached there is good grazing for camels; on the plateau beyond none is obtainable for some miles. Water for this halt is taken from Wushah. Qallah Mahafidh. Musaifi. See paragraph on topography above. The distance to the traveller is 18 miles, and the direction nearly due south. The Qallah Maha- fihd plateau is traversed for 3 miles; the hollow containing the Hamdah well is then crossed; and at 12 miles the well of Yahfar-al-Faiyah is reached. Throughout this march, after Qallah Mahafidh is left behind, Jabal Faiyah is upon the right at one or two miles distance, and the path winds over a well-wooded sandy plain. An alternative halting place to Musaifi is Yidaiwi, also in the Madam plain but 6 miles further to the south-west. Musaifi Haza'-adh- Dhabi. Do. The actual distance is 19 miles and the general direction is nearly due south. The route crosses between 10 and 12 miles a projecting tongue of the western sand desert. At 14 miles it falls into Wadi Samaini in which it continues almost until the halting place is reached. Haza'-adh- Dhabi. Misakin. (N.B.—Jhis is not the Misakin well but a place near the right bank of Wadi Misakin higher up.) See article Mahadhah. The distance by road is 16 miles and the average direction of the track, which is crooked, is a little to the west of south. At 1 mile Wadi Samaini is crossed, and one of its tributaries is ascended from this point for 2 miles. The rolling sand hills of Ramlat 'Anaij are then crossed for 3 miles, and at their conclusion Bat-hah Sanaibil is intersected. Sand dunes of milder and less barren appearance follow, and at 9 miles the peculiar well of Safwan is reached. At 11 miles the traveller crosses the dry Bat-hah Nawai-i and ascends to the sandy Shibhat-al-Khadim tract which continues for 10 miles: he then enters an extensive depression in the sandhills, the drainage of which is carried by Wadi Misakin, Misakin Jimi Village in the Baraimi Oasis. See article Baraimi Oasis. The distance by route is 20 miles, and the general direction is south-south-west. The route runs at first more west than south along Wadi Misakin, just before leaving which the Misakin well on the right is passed: for the next 4 miles it lies over the gentle sandy undulations of the Batin-al-'Ovan and the direction is southerly. After this it wanders for 7 miles in the difficult sandy desert of Ramlat Kahal. Mas'udi is the first settlement passed after dropping from the high sand-dine tract into the Baraimi Oasis. The total distance from Ras-al-Khaimah Town to Jimi by this route 1S 125 miles, and the journey is generally performed by caravans in 6 to 8 days. There is no well-worn track, and no two caravans follow exactly the same course. Camel transport is the only kind used in travelling by this line; tor donkeys 4he only other beast of burden available—cannot, when laden, negotiate the sandy tiacts158 that have to be crossed on the way. The wells along the route are generally from 40 to 60 feet deep and are lined for the uppermost 8 or 10 feet with timbers or rough hewn stone from the hills: the water is invariably raised by means of a leather bucket which is hauled by a rope over a pulley, the pulley bein^ suspended from a trestle over the well mouth. f ^ 5 f u This route is the main artery of traffic in the 'Oman Promontory; the place of feeders to it is taken by routes 1 (h), 1 (c) and 1 (d) above, which intersect it at or near Muraqqibat, Dhaid village and Yahfar-al-Faiyah, respectively. There is reason to think that, by following a line somewhat further to eastwards and more closely adjoining the foot of the main hills, a line might be found which could without much labour be adapted for wheeled traffic, and that it might not be difficult io connect such a road with the Batinah coast by means of another road down Wadi-al-Qor. 2 (h). Route from Dihai Town to the Bar a imi Oasis*. —This route, which apparently runs straight across the intervening desert, is identical with route No. 1 (d) above as far as Khawanij. The names of points subsequently passed are given as 'Awir, Habab, Badu'-al-Hilli, Madhlul. Faqa' and Khasub. The distance in a direct line is between 70 and 75 miles. 2 (c). Route from Abu Dhabi Town to the Baraimi Oasis]. —The distance is about 100 miles by the route ordinarily followed which runs a little south of east. The stages are Maqta 1 , where the creek behind Abu Dhabi Town is crossed, 10 miles; from Maqta' to Suq Iblis, a rocky landmark, 14 miles; Suq Iblis to Nahshilah, water holes, 28 miles; Nahshilah to Bui Huwail, wells, 15 miles; Bui Huwail by Nasuriyah to Juhar, water holes, 25 miles; Juhar to the Baraimi Oasis, 12 miles. Stages named Habal and Muwaih Arnab, slightly more to the south', may be substituted for those of SOq Iblis and Nahshilah. The track from Maqta' to Baraimi lies over a desert of sand dunes, and there is almost no grazing by the way. Routes connecting the Baraimi Oasis with Mahadhah and Mahadhah with the route from the Baraimi Oasis to Sohar Town are shortly noticed in the article upon Mahadhah. 3. There is no fixed route between Baraimi or Trucial 'Oman and the Hasa Sanjaq, and ditlerent caravans follow different lines of wells across Dhafrah and the tiacts beyond it. A straighter and more inland course is apparently preferred by travellers in winter; while those who make the journey in summer generally take a route less direct but nearer to the coast. Sila', Sakak and the^ foot of Dohat-as -Salwa seem to be among the usual halting places in either season. The journey as a whole is not considered dangerous or even difficult; for water, though brackish, is found in many places, and it is seldom necessary to carry a supply lor more than two days. A messenger can cover the distance from Baraimi to Hofuf in ten davs; caravans take about a month.t *r _ Administration. —Each of the five principalities of Umm-al -Qaiwain, 'Ajman, Sharjah, Dibai and Abu Dhabi is ruled by an independent Shaikh, whose possessions on the sea coast are generally under full control; while all except the Shaikh of Ajman, and particularly the Shaikh ot Abu Dhabi, exercise some authority or influence over Bedouin tribes in the interior. For further details the separate article on each principality may be consulted. Political position, foreign relations and foreign interests. —The political position of TYucial Oman in regard to Great Britain is difficult to define with exactitude; it is regulated in the main by two agreements, each of which has been signed by, and is individually binding upon, the five Shaikhs of 'Ajman, Abu Dhabi, Dibai^ Umm-al -Qaiwain and Sharjah. The earlier in date of these agreements is a perpetual truce, concluded in 1853, which provided lor the entire cessation of hostilities at sea among the signatories, and imposed on the British Government the duty of enforcing peace and obtaining reparation lor maritime aggressions committed in contravention of the arrangement. It is in virtue of this treaty that the Shaikhs of the principalities are styled'Trucial Shaikhs and that their country may appropriately be styled Trucial 'Oman. * Authority. —From native information. t Authority. —Major P. Z. Cox from personal observation and enquiry. t Col. Miles (vide J. A. S. B. Volume XLVI, Part I, Nos. 1-1V, 1877, pages 59-60) gives more precise directions than these, but the positions and even the order ot his stages do not always agree well with the results of the most recent enquiries.159 By the second treaty, s.gned in 1892, the Trucial Shaikhs bound themselves not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with a power other ^ the British Government; not to permit, without the assent of the British Government the residence within their territories of the agent of any other government and not to cede, se 1, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territories save to the British Government. The exact international effect of these two agreements is a matter for publicists to determine, but taken together they evidently create preferential and almost exclusive relations between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs — relations which might be held to imply the dependence of the Shaikhs on the British Government in toicign affairs and a moral obligation on the part of the British Government to protect the Shaikhs in so far aslhey may be endangered, or disabled from defending themselves, in consequence of the treaties of 1853 and That the existence ol some such position has been in a sense recognised by the Government of the French Republic will be apparent on reference to the historical volume or this Gazetteer. Biitish subjects in Tiucial Oman are distributed as follows and include at each place a proportion of women and children:— Town. Dhabi (Abu) ... Dibai ... Qaiwan (Umm-al-) Khaimah (Ras-al-) Sharjah .. Totals ... Hindus. 65 67 11 Nil 51 194 Muhammadans. Nil 23 Nil 33 158 214 If some Persians from the opposite coast and their concerns are left out of account, Great Britain is still the only foreign country which possesses any moral or material interests or subjects in Trucial Oman: for the protection of these a Native Agent of the Persian Gulf Residency is maintained at Sharjah Town. The subjects in question are the Indians, Hindus and Khojahs, who are settled in the larger ports. One of the most compact and powertul tribes of Trucial 'Oman; their range YAS is practically co-extensive with the territories of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the (BANI) basis of whose power they are. [pp. 1932-5] The following is a tabular view of the composition of the tribe:— Section. Houses and distribution. Falah (Al) Falah (Al Bu). 35 houses at Dhawaihir, Kaiyih and Shidaq -al-Kalb in Liwah. About 10 houses at Abu Dhabi | Town, and 5 at Kaiyih and Shah in Liwah. Falasah (Al Bu). 440 houses in Trucial 'Oman, viz., 400 in Dibai Town and 40 in Abu Dhabi Town; 120 house in Bahrain, viz., 100 at Hadd and the remainder at Bisaitin, Umm-ash-Shajar. Umm-ash-Shajairah, Halat- as-Sulutah and Muharraq Town; 10 at Dohar i n Qatar; and 40 at Fanyah on Tarut island in the Hasa Sanjaq. Remarks. This section own 2,000 date palms; they have no pearl boats of their own, but some of them go to the banks from Bandar Radaim on boats belonging to other sections. One of their subdivisions is known as the Al Sa'adun. The Al Bu Falah are also known as the Al Nahyan; they are the section to which the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi personnaly belongs. One or two of those in Liwah go to the pearl fisheries, but they own no boats: the remainder of those in Liwah subsist by their date palms which number about 4,000. Singular is Falahi. The Al Bu Falasah who live outside of Trucial 'Oman are divided into the following sections:—Mijardah (singular Majarudi), Rawashid (singular Rashidi) and Yidaiwator Lidaiwat (singular Yidaiwi). These are all Maliki Sunnis, like the rest of the tribe elsewhere, and are engaged in the pearl fisheries and in navigation. Singular is Falasi.160 Section, Houses and distribution. Remarks. Hamir (A1 Bu). 60 houses in Abu Dhabi Town and 140 in the open with the Qumzan. This appears to be the principal Bedouin section. Singular is Hamiri. Hawamil 100 houses at Abu Dhabi Town, 50 in the neighbour hood, and 190 in Liwah at Hadhi, Shah, Subakhah, Tharwaniyah, Wahaidah and Wazil. The Hawamil of Liwah own 20 Baqarahs in which they go pearling from Bandar Radaim. They have also 100 camels and 8,000 date palms. Singular is Hamili. Maharibah 60 houses in Abu Dhabi Town, 50 in the neighbourhood, and 150 in Liwah at Dhafir, Muzaira'ah, Qarmidah, Salimi and Taraq. The Maharibah have 40 Baqarahs of their own in which they go pearling, those of Liwah from Bander Radaim and those of Abu Dhabi Town from their own port. The Maharibah of Liwah have 600 date trees. Singular is Mahairabi, Mazari' 60 houses in Abu Dhabi Town and 315 in Liwah at 'Ayih, Hafif, Huwailah, Khannur, Lidamah, Latir (II), Mari- yah and Suhail. The Mazari' of Liwah own 20 Baqarahs and go pearling from Bandar Radaim: they have also 8,000 date trees and are said to possess very large numbers of horses and camels and a few goats. The other Mazari' of Trucial 'Oman, who may or may not be identical with this section of the Bani Yas, are dealt with in the article Mazari'. Qanaisat 15 houses in Liwah at Latir (1) This section have 3,000 date trees, and a few of them go pearling from Mughairah. They possess 5 or 6 camels and a few goats. Singular is Qanaisi. Qasal 8 houses in Liwah at Shah. The men are all pearl fishers and own 4 boats. They have also 800 date trees. Qubaisat 75 houses at Abu Dhabi Town; 185 in Liwah at 'Attab, Dhawaihir, Mariyah, Mu zaira'ah, Qarmidah, Qutuf, Shidaq-al-Kalb, and Yaif; 15 on Dalmah island; and 15 at Wakrah in Qatar. Those in Liwah are credited with the possession of 10.000 date palms and 60 camels. The section generally are pearl divers and have 40 Baqarahs at Abu Dhabi Town and 16 others at Mughairah, etc., upon the coast of Dhafrah. The Qubaisat had formerly a permanent settlement at Khor-al -'Odaid, a place to which they have more than once seceded. Qumzan 50 houses in Abu Dhabi Town and 100 in the country ad joining, especially in the neighbourhood of Raknah. This section have 100 camels; they go pearling from Abu Dhabi Town and possess 20 Baqarahs. Singu lar is Qamzi. Rumaithat 100 houses in Abu Dhabi Town and 50 in the country ad joining, particularly about Samaih. The Rumaithat have 100 camels and 30 Baqarahs; they go to the pearl fisheries from Abu Dhabi Town. Singular is Armaithi. Sabais 40 houses at Dibai Town. Originally Tanaij, but now regarded as a section of the Bani Yas. Singular is Sabusi. Shikr (Bani) 80 houses in Liwah at Muqab They have 4,000 date trees and 12 pearl boats; the base of their pearling operations is generally Bandar Mirfah on the Dhafrah coast. Singular is Shukri. Sultan (Al) 35 houses in Liwah at Kaiyih, Qarmidah and Shidaq-al- Kalb. The Al Sultan are very closely connected with the Al Falaf. They own 3.000 date palms and go to the pearl banks from Bandar Radaim and Khor Mughairah. Singular is Sultani. The A1 Bu 'Amim of Abu Dhabi Town are now generally regarded as included in the Bani Yas; and the Halalamah, who where formerly a section of the Bam Qitab, are at the present day attached to the Bani Yas; so also the Thamairat, who were originally Marar. Besides the above, a few Bani Yas whose section has not been ascertained are found at Jumairah in the Dibai Principality and about 1,200 on Hanjam island. It will be observed that the total number of the tribe in Trucial 'Oman is about 12,000 souls, of whom some 10,000 are settled and 2,000 are Bedouins.161 The Bedouins are all in the Abu Dhabi Principality j of the non-nomadic portion about 2,000 are in Dibai territory, but the remainder of them, about 8 000 persons are all subjects of the Abu Dhabi Shaikh. Besides the Bani Yas of Trucial 'Oman there are, it will be seen, about 600 of the tribe settled in Bahrain, 200 on Tarut island in the Hasa Sanjaq, and over 100 in Qatar, besides those on Hanjam The ruins of the Muraijib fort and the incipient villages of Jahali and Mas'udi attest also the past and present connection of the tribe with the Baraimi Oasis, which^is nearer to their ancestral country than the settlements just mentioned but still outside the tribal territories proper. It will also be noticed that the Bani Yas of the Dibai Principality nearly all belong to the Al Bu Falasah section and that those of Bahrain and Tarut and part of those in Qatar are likewise members of this roving subdivision, which is now but slightly represented in the original home of the tribe. The resources of the Bani Yas and their occupations are sufficiently explained in the table above and in the article on Dhafrah, in the Liwah division of which tract nearly half the tribe have their permanent abode. The Bani Yas of the Abu Dhabi Principality are on the whole well affected and faithful to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who is himself of their number. The principal exception to this rule are the Qubaj_sat section who have at times evinced a disposition to follow the example of the Al Bu Falasah by hiving off from the main body of the tribe; but at the present time they are stationary and appear to be contented. The principal men of the tribe, under the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, are Buti-bin-Khadim of the Qubaisat section, who generally resides at Abu Dhabi Town but is headman of Muzaira'ah, 'Attab and Qarmidah in Liwah; Hamad- bin-Aghtail of the Maharibah section, under whose authority are Dhafir and Taraq in Liwah; Rashid-bin-Humaid of the Hawamil section, to whom Hadhi, Shah, Subakhah and Wazil in Liwah are subject; and Faris-bin-'Ali of the Mazari' section, who is over Khannur Hafif and Mariyah in Liwah, and himself lives at Khannur. The Bani Yas are of the Hinawi political faction and differ from most of their neighbours in being, wherever they occur, Maliki Sunnis and not Hanabilah. They have at present no special relations of friendship or enmity with adjoining tribes.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002bf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/729</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002bf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/729</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Extracts from Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia by J G Lorimer CIE, Indian Civil Service'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1900/1925</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-04-04T11:22:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (86 folios)</extent><extent>There is a table of contents at the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at 1 on the front cover and terminates at 88 on the back cover.
