The Emirs of the 'ABADILAH clan are of the Qoreish tribe and directly descended from Hasan, son of the Caliph 'Ali and of Fatimah, the Prophet's daughter. The present ruling family dates its power to Sherif Mohammed ' ibn 'Aun who displaced in 1827 the Dhawi Zeid house represented by his predecessor, Ghalib. He was a friend of Mohammed 'Ali of Egypt. Ihe latter presented the Emir with 5,700 feddans of land in Upper Egypt, of which 2,000 were constituted waqf. This property is now administered for the Emir. The family has also about 500 feddans at Dawakhilah, near Mahallah, divided between the Emir, his brother Nasir (q. v.), his sisters and his mother ; 100 feddans at Bahtin, and proper ties at Mecca, Ta'if, W. Fatimah, W. Leimun, and W. Rayyan. The principal residences of the Emirs are at Mecca (winter) and Ta'if (summer). They maintain a princely state and are the most civilized as well as the wealthiest of Arabian potentates. HUSEIN IBN 'ALL Ruling Emir since 1908, when, after twenty-live years' residence in Constantinople, he was nominated, by Kiamil Pasha, to succeed his uncle, 'Abdillah, who had died on his way to Mecca. Of a little over middle height, with fairish complexion and white chin-beard, carefully but not closely clipped. Dignified manners. Intelligent. He is now approaching 70 years of age ; of pacific temper, and popular in Hejaz. Headed the revolt in June 1916, commanding at Mecca, which he took June 13, the fort and barracks surrendering later. The only sign of ambition which he had given before the present crisis was in 1910, when he sent a force under his son, 'Abdullah, to Qaslm, nominally to assert the rights of the Ateibah tribe, but really to wrest the district from Ibn Sa'ud, and subject it again to that dependence on Hejaz in which theEMIRATE OF MECCA, continued. Egyptian forces had left it in the middle of the nineteenth century. 'Abdullah seized Sa'd, Ibn Sa'ud's brother; but disappointed by Ibn Rashid, who respected a recently con cluded peace, readily came to terms with Ibn Sa'ud as soon as the latter appeared in the field, and retired, saving his face by making certain stipulations about the Ateibah being tax-free, and the Qashn towns paying an annual subsidy of £4,000 to Mecca, and being at liberty to elect their own Emirs, whether Ibn Sa'uds or others. Throughout this affair Husein posed as the close ally and representative of the Ottoman Government. In its interest also, as well as his own, he took other action in 1910, partly through his son 'Abdullah (q. v.), against Idrisi (q. v.), and detached the latter's strongest supporters, as well as saved Ibha for the Turks ; but latterly he has shown some inclination to compromise this feud, and to unite Idrisi and the Imam of Yemen with himself. Since 1913 he has taken up a distinct anti-Ottoman attitude. He opposed the prolongation of the Hejaz Railway from Medina, supporting the Harb tribesmen, and he refused to call out Hejazi recruits for the Ottoman armies. In order, however, to save himself from heavy requisitions, he allowed a battalion of irregulars to be enrolled at Medina, in 1915, for service with the Turks in Sinai. In the summer of 1915 he approached us with a view to establishing his independence, and, after being assured of our support, made arrangements with the Harb, Ateibah, and other Hejaz tribes, as well as with some of the Anazah group, and raised the standard of revolt near Medina on June 5, 1916. On June 9 he attacked also Mecca, Jiddah, and Ta'if. The first two surrendered quickly, but Ta'if held out for nearly four months. Both there and at Medina his Arabs (about 15,000 armed men in all) proved little able to deal with fortified positions and artillery. Yambo' surrendered to him at the end of July, and Lith a little earlier. Though he had concluded an agreement with Idrisi, he was aggrieved at the latter's occupation of Qunfudah in July, and sent an expedition to turn his force out; but Idrisi subsequently withdrew without fighting. He appears to have a good hold on the Hejaz tribes except the Zobeid Harb under Husein ibn Mubeirik of Rabugh, whose ambitions conflict with his. While the Juheinah obey him, the Billi are uncertain, and there has not yet been proof of the effective adhesion of any tribes farther north, except the southern Wuld 'Ali. He aspires to a wide suzerainty, extending over not only the Syrian desert but Syria itself. Ibn Sa'ud has observed a friendly, but watchful, neutrality ; Ibn Rashid has sided with the Turks ; the Imam of Yemen has not actively assisted Husein, but is inclined to negotiate ; Nuri Sha'lan (q.v.) is allied with him.5 EMIRATE OF MECCA, continued. Emir Husein's reputation is that rather of a politician than of a leader of men ; but he has much influence among desert tribesmen (e.g. Harb all sections, Ateibah, Juheinah, Billi, Hudheil, Juhadlah, and some smaller S. Hejazi groups). He keeps in touch with the Pan-Arabists in Syria, &amp;c., and wields a wide local influence extending south to W. Bishah in Asir and inland through Qasim to Sedeir. He has four sons : 'ALL His father's favourite and Grand Vizier. Short and slim, looking a little old already, though only thirty-seven. Slightly bent. Skin rather sallow, large deep brown eyes, nose thin and a little hooked, face somewhat worn and full of lines and hollows, mouth drooping. Beard spare and black. Has very delicate hands. His manners are perfectly simple, and he is obviously a very conscientious, careful, pleasant, gentleman, without force of character, nervous and rather tired. His physical weakness makes him subject to quick fits of shaking passion with more frequent moods of infirm obstinacy. Apparently not ambitious for himself, but swayed somewhat too easily by the wishes of others. Is bookish, and learned in law and religion. Shows his Arab blood more than his brothers. At Medina from March to June, 1915, and mediated between the Harb tribesmen and Ghalib Pasha, the incoming Vali of Hejaz, obtaining leave for the latter to proceed, on swearing that he had no Germans with him. He is said to have gone north towards Syria in January 1916, with a few followers, most of his escort having been detained by a tribal disturbance near Medina, apparently provoked expressly to detain him. Originally three clans of the Harb (the 'Auf, Beni 'Amr, and Zeid el- 'Alauni) had proposed to follow him to the Canal. In June 1916 he took command of the force destined to blockade Medina, and defeated a Turkish sortie at Ghadir-Rabugh in August. Habitually represents his father at Medina. 'ABDULLAH. Minister for Foreign Affairs and President of the Legis lative Council. Aged 35, but looks younger. Short and thick built, apparently as strong as a horse, with merry dark- brown eyes, a round smooth face, full but short lips, straight nose, brown beard. In manner affectedly open and very charming, not standing at all on ceremony, but jesting with the tribesmen like one of their own sheikhs. On serious occasions he judges his words carefully, and shows himself a keen dialectician. Is probably not so much the brain as6 the spur of his father. He is obviously working to establish the greatness of the family, and has large ideas, which no doubt include his own particular advancement. The Arabs consider him a most astute politician, and a far-seeing states man : but he has possibly more of the former than of the latter in his composition. Has visited Egypt. Formerly Deputy for Mecca in the Ottoman Parliament, and not on good terms with the Committee. Quarrelled with Enver. An experienced warrior and capable leader, who has seen a deal of fighting. Sent in March 1915 with a large escort on a mission to Ibn Sa'ud and Ibn Rashld to negotiate peace between the Central Emirates and collect arrears of dues from Qashn and Sedeir. In this he was successful. Late in I 9 I 5 h e went to Syria with a considerable following, but returned early in 1916, and took command of the force besieging Ta'if. Led it in many impetuous assaults and took the place after four months. Is reputed to aim at the Caliphate for his House. FEISAL. Minister of the Interior. Age 31. Tall, graceful, vigor ous, almost regal in appearance. Very quick and restless in movement. Far more imposing personally than any of his brothers ; knows it and trades on it. Is as clear-skinned as a pure Circassian, with dark hair, vivid black eyes set a little sloping in his face, strong nose, short chin. Looks like a European. He is hot tempered, proud and impatient, some times unreasonable, and runs off easily at tangents. Possesses far more personal magnetism and life than his brothers, but less prudence. Obviously very clever, perhaps not over scrupulous. Rather narrow-minded, and rash when he acts on impulse, but usually with enough strength to reflect, and then exact in judgement. A popular idol, and ambitious ; full of dreams, and the capacity to realize them, with keen p^i -onal insight, and a very efficient man of business. V- ent to Constantinople in March 1915, as Deputy for Hejaz, nominally to protest against the enrolment of Hejazis, but really to spy out the strength of the Turks. On his return tried to see Xuri Sha'lan at Damascus, but on repeated orders of Jemal Pasha, had to leave before Nawwaf, son of N'uri, arrived. Said to have more influence with tribesmen than Abdullah, Late in 1915 went up to Syria with a sma .i following, on (it is said) a secret mission from his Returned February 1916 with Enver and Jemal to Medina, but again went to Syria till May. In June 1916 took command of the Arab force on the Hejaz railway, but effected little and returned to operate with 'Ali beforeRULING SHERIFIAL ('ABADILAH) FAMILY OF MECCA 1 Mohammed ibn 'Abd el Mu'in ibn 'Aun (Emir, 1827-51 and 1856-8).

He stands in consider able awe of official authority, having been imprisoned for some months in Damascus in 1911 by Sami Pasha.

The fortunes of the Idrisi family began with Seyyid Ahmed, the great-grandfather of the present ruler. Ahmed founded a tarlqah (fra ternity) at Fez, and in 1799 went to Mecca, where he opened a school and propagated his tariqah. Among his adherents was one Mohammed el-Morghani, with whom in 1813 he migrated to Zeinia, near Luxor, afterwards (1815) sending him to the Sudan {v. 'Ali el-Morghani). Having returned to Mecca in 1817, he received (1823) into his tariqah the original Sheikh Senussi, Mohammed 'Ali, who came from Fez. In 1829, after a visit to the famous Seminary of Zebid in Yemen, where Sherif Husein, the son of Sherif 'Ali, the ruler of Abu 'Arish, was powerful, he went to the latter district and fixed his residence at Sabia (Sablyah), bringing all his family from Mecca. There he died in 1837, having acquired much land and reputation for sanctity, and his tomb became a holy centre, upon which, and the family owning it, was focussed gradually the spirit of independence which has always moved the Abu 'Arlsh district to keep itself detached equally from the Turks, the Sherif of Mecca, and the Imam of Yemen. Seyyid Ahmed's second son, 'Abd el-'Al, joined the Senussi in Cyrenaica, and remained with him until the latter's death at Jaghbub in 1859. The elder son, Mohammed, with his son 'Ali, stayed at Sabia, increasing the wealth and influence of his family. After the final defeat, in 1849, of Sherif Husein of Abu 'Arish, who had overrun most of the Yemen Tihamah, the Idrisis seem to have succeeded to the local head ship, and to have kept Husein's conquerors, the Turks, at a distance. 'Ali's son, Mohammed, is the present head of the family. MOHAMMED IBN 'ALI EL-IDRlSI, SEYYID. Born in 1876. Independent ruler of the Abu 'Arish district of S. Asir, and suzerain of a considerable tribal confederacy, embracing the tribes of the Asir coastlands as far north as Qunfudah, and south towards Loheia (Lahiyah), together with some of the inland 'Aqabah. His own ports are Jeizan and Midi, and his capital is Sabia, about 20 miles inland ESE. from Jeizan. He claims the coast as far south as Habil (lat. 16.9 N.) or Wadi 'Ain. In 1896, when he was just twenty, he left Sabia and went to stay in Upper Egypt with his relations at Zeinia. Thence he proceeded to the Azhar in Cairo, where he married, and in 1899 he remained nine months with his cousin, the Senussi, at Jaghbub and Kufra. After marrying a second23 IDRlSI PRINCIPATE, continued. wife and spending some time with his relatives at Argo (Arju), in the Sudan, he returned to Asir and began to organize an anti-Turkish power in a district which had been conquered by Ra'uf and Mukhtar Pashas (1869-72) but had resumed active revolt since 1892. In 1910 he took up arms against both the Turkish Governor of Ibha and the Sherif of Mecca. He failed, however, before Ibha, to whose relief the Sherif sent his son, 'Abdullah, with a considerable force ; the latter succeeded in detaching most of Idrisi's tribal following. During the Tripolitan War he kept up his recalcitrant attitude, relying on Italian supplies of arms and money ; but, on these failing and his tribesmen beginning to fall away from him, he tried to come to terms with the Imam, whose ambitions had received a definite check by the relief of San'a. A treaty was signed at Rijal; but its subsequent violation by the Imam has led to a more irre mediable breach. In 1914 he was negotiating for Ottoman recognition through Tzzet Bey el-Ghindi, but, not able to get any better terms than a mere Kaimmakamship of Abu 'Arish and Sabia, came over to us definitely, signed an anti-Ottoman treaty with the Resident at Aden in May 1915, and was supplied with arms and muni tions, with which he has had moderate success against unforti fied positions, but has not yet captured Loheia, his main objective. Pleading lack of ammunition and other means, he withdrew to his own territory at the end of the year, made a truce with the Imam, and undertook no further hostilities against the Turks, except in border squabbles with the Wa'zat and with some of his own federation, e.g. the 'Abs, and Marwan, until after the Hejaz Revolt had broken out in June 1916. Meanwhile, the exemption from blockade which we had conceded to his ports, proved a means for the enrichment of himself and his immediate followers, notably his vizier, Moham med Yahya Ba Sahi (q.v.), and led to an unsatisfactory position which engaged the continual attention of Aden. The Resident constantly urged him to positive anti-Turk action, but he still pleaded lack of means. After beinpj assured of the fall of Jiddah, in June 1916, he was induced to write a letter to the Sherif of Mecca, promising co-operation and offering to subordinate his own interests, while at the same time he did not abate his claim to all Asir ; and he collected a small tribal force and moved north. When Qunfudah surrendered the place was at once occupied on Idrisi's behalf by the sheikhs of Birk, and his flag was hoisted. This seriously displeased the Sherif, who sent a force towards the town from Llth. Idrisi refused, however, to withdraw his garrison, although the Sherif's demand was supported by us.24 IDRlSI PRINCIPATE, continued. and threatened to go over to the Turks, whom he was reported to be blockading in Muha'il and Ibha ; but in August he consented to evacuate the place and at the same time raised the blockade of Muha'il and Ibha. Since then he has kept quiet, but is in a discontented, if not actively disloyal, frame of mind towards us. He is a man of 40, tall, broad, of dark, almost negroid, type. He is of courteous, suave, and polished manners and great energy; loud-voiced, histrionic, and reputed possessed of magical powers by his adherents. Distinctly intelligent. He is to be reckoned with, and may be trusted so long as his interest is also clearly ours. But he is out for his personal ambition, wherein he is handicapped by lack of noble lineage. Among Arabs he is parvenu. Idrisi has connexions not only with Zeinia in Kgypt {v. Mustafa el-Idrisi), but with the Sudan through a branch of the family formerly settled in Argo Island, but now in Yemen, and through the Morghani family. The Somali Mullah is a member of the Idrisi tariqah. Idrisi is said to desire to bind himself more intimately to the Senussi by marriage ; but in any case the connexion, based on past events, as related above, and on various intermarriages, is close. Idrisi, however, is not himself a fervent Pan-Islamist, or over fond of a religious character and its restrictions. MUSTAFA IBN 'ABD EL-'AL EL-IDRISI. SEYYID.

(See also p. 200.)REGION III YEMEN IMAMATE OF YEMEN. This principate, now mediatized under Ottoman suzerainty, has a very long history of intermittent independence. Originally its seat was at Sa'dah, in the extreme north of the Yemen highlands, where a Zeidist 1 dynasty (known as the Rassite) was founded at the beginning of the tenth century by Yahya el-Hadi, a direct descendant of Hasan, son of the Caliph 'Ali and Fatimah. When the Turks were expelled from the highlands, in 1639, Mansur el-Qashn, a descendant of Yahya, obtained power over all inland Yemen from Sa'dah to Ta'izz, and made San'a his capital. There his successors reigned till past the middle of the nineteenth century, the Egyptians never succeeding in establishing themselves on the highlands. The latter withdrew from Yemen altogether in 1840 , but aftei a few years of anarchy, tempered by the dominion of Sherif Husein ol Abu Arish in the lihamah, the Turks succeeded in gaining a footing once more in the country, and even in reaching San a. 1 hough they could not hold the highlands, their firm establish ment in Hodeidah, and the incompetency of the Imam Ghalib, led to a decline in the prestige of the Imamate. Native rule went from bad to worse, until at last, in 1872, the notables of San'a itself invited the Turks to occupy the place. The Imam was pensioned, and the titular ruler relapsed into obscurity for twenty years. After much unrest, the northern tribes broke out into definite revolt in 1891, proclaiming their allegiance to a member of the Rassite family, Yahya Hamid ed-Din, of the Qasim house of Sheharah, not directly descended from any recent Imam. On this outbreak Yahya Hamid ed-Din fled to Sa'dah, and there lemained, leaving the lead of the fighting forces to his cousin, Ahmed esh-Shera i, who was finally defeated by Ahmed Feizi Pasha. Yahya himself appears never to have been recognized as Imam, but his son, Mohammed el-Mansur, was accepted as such by the tribes. He died in 1904, and his son, Yahya, succeeded. The influence of the Imams is confined almost entirely to the Zeidist districts of Y emen, that is, the central highlands and the inland central part of the fihamah. In Asir, on the Tihamah coast, and in the Aden hinterland, where the population is predominantly Sunnite of the Shafei school, it goes for little or nothing. The office is elective, like the Ibadhi 1 Zeidism is a modified form of Shiism, a sort of opportunist ' trimming ' between Shnsm and Sunmsm. Zeidists hold that a true Leader of the Faithful must be of the Prophets own seed, in order to have the esoteric knowledge and supernatural qua ities of Infallibility, &amp;c., which their instinct for Incarnationism and desire to worship their ruler as semi-divine demand. The first three Caliphs were not such true eaders. But they are accepted by Zeidists as legitimate Caliphs on the principle that Leaders, worthy of reverence but not worship, can be appointed now and then for reasons expe iency. Dicre may, theiefore, be at one and the same time an Imam who is a true Leader, and also a Caliph, acting as political Leader.43 IMAMATE OF YEMEN, continued. Imamate in Oman ; but, in practice, a lineal descendant of the last Imam is usually, and a scion of the original Rassite stock is invariably, preferred. There are, however, a number of rival houses of that stock, some being not sherifial but seyyid (e. g. the Shehari house to which the two Imams before the present ruler's father belonged) ; and there has been much chopping and changing among them in past elections, and rivalry and jealousy exist, other houses, e.g. the Hadi Lidin Allah (of which was the Imam 'Ali el-Mansur, three times elected in the last century) and the Shehari, considering themselves better entitled to the Imamate than the Qaslm at present in power. The Imam is essentially a sacred personage, and for some generations back the holders of the title have lived more or less in seclusion, mysterious beings, little seen by the people, though sometimes addicted to very profane vices. To this Shiite conception of their office the Imams owe it that they have never obtained the recognition and the dominant position among Moslems accorded to the Sherifs of Mecca. YAHYA IBN MOHAMMED HAMID ED-DlN EL-MUTAWAKKIL. Sherif, of the Qaslm house at Sheharah. Imam since 1904, when he succeeded his father, who had been elected some time after the Yemenite revolt of 1891. The latter lived an ascetic life in Sa'dah, making no terms with the Turks. Yahya, who is now about 45 years of age (1916), headed a fresh outbreak in 1904 and captured San'a. Driven out after a few months he held on in Khamir, and in 1910 besieged San'a again for three months, but was driven off by Tzzet Pasha. He was then closely pressed, and in 1912 (on representations made, it is said, by the Sherif of Mecca and the Sheikh Senussi) agreed, in view of the jihad proclaimed against the Italians, to an arrangement to which Tzzet during a visit to Constantinople had, with some difficulty, persuaded the Porte. He accepted a mediatized status with residence in the fortress of Sheharah (about forty miles (?) N. of 'Amran) and a subsidy since raised to £'1.30,000 (£T. 12,000 for himself, and the balance for his vassal chiefs). Both Sheharah and Khamir were, however, garrisoned by the Turks. Yahya had become friendly with Mahmud Nazim Pasha (q. v.), who had acted for Tzzet during the latter's absence at Constantinople, and, when Tzzet left Yemen, and Mahmud Nazim succeeded him (1913), this friendship stood the Turks in good stead. After Mahmud Nazim's super session, in 1914, the Imam began to raise difficulties, and he expressed disapproval of the attack on Aden in 1915, as an infringement of his prerogative. Mahmud Nazim returned to power in October 1915, and the Imam wrote a complimentary letter to Enver in November praying for the success of the Ottoman armies. In the earlier44 part of 1916 he sent a mission under strong escort into the Beida and 'Aulaqi districts of the Aden Hinterland, and made advances to the Hadhramaut chiefs, especially to the Kathiri : but was not very successful. Bitterly opposed to Idrisi, whom he betrayed in 1912, he has, however, kept a truce with him since the end of 1915. His Turkish sentiments seem on the wane, and he has shown lately some desire for an under standing with the Emir of Mecca, though he had taken no notice of the latter's offer to reconcile him with Idrisi in the earlier summer of 1916. Though bound by his position to administer the Sheri'ah and maintain a religious character, Yahya is more lax in obser vance than his father, and lives less in religious seclusion. He is said to be an intelligent man of honest, but somewhat weak and yielding, character, and owing to his closeness in money matters, and inconstancy to friends, not to have much hold over the Zeidist tribesmen of Hashid and highlanders of Central Yemen. In fact the tribesmen of Hashid and Bekll have largely gone over to Idrisi; while the Ashraf, to which body the Imam belongs, are deeply disaffected. He is unlikely either to head another revolt or to enter into relations with us. But he could, on occasion, marshal and arm a large force, and he has guns and munitions of his own and could procure more from the Turks. Lender his agreement with the Turks, Yahya is free to enforce the Sheri'ah, according to Zeidist practice, in all Zeidi districts of Yemen ; and he has power to appoint and remove judges and magistrates in such districts (including the city of San'a), with the approval of the Porte. These districts were to be exempt from tithe for ten years from 1912, and the Imam's adherents were to be amnestied, on condition of good behaviour. 'ABD EL-BARI IBN AHMED, S eyyid. Of the Ahdal house (q.v.) of Marwah, a town inhabited chiefly by Seyyids. The most important Seyyid in the Turkish Tihamah, of a family exempt from taxation by an old firman. Greatly respected and much sought after in tribal disputes. Accompanied Mahmud Nazim and Ragheb Bey (q.v.) on an unsuccessful mission to Idrisi in June 1913. In January 1916 Idrisi asked us to allow supplies to go through to 'Abd el-Bari, who is said to be anti-Turk and in league with the Zaranik. Reputed to have called down lightning on a mosque at Marwah where the Turks had stored ammunition from Hodeidah in spring 1916. In any case there was an explosion.45 GENEALOGY OF THE IMAMS OF SAN'A PREVIOUS TO THE REIGNING DYNASTY {Ruling Imams in capitals, and living persons in heavy type.)

The Sultan's jurisdiction covers, however, all the coast-line from Kharifot to Khor Kalba. The reigning family of the Al Bu Sa'Id owes its elevation to AHMED IBN SA l ID of the Azd tribe, formerly a trader and then Governor of Sohar for Seif ibn Sultan, the last Ya'rabi Imam of Muscat. He mustered the inland tribesmen in 1741, and expelled the Persian allies of his pre decessor from the country. His lineal descendant in the fifth generation is the present Sultan. Other inland chiefs, however, and in particular the Sheikhs of Rostaq, have never acquiesced willingly in the claim of the Sultans of Muscat to exercise overlordship over them, and they have more than once come near expelling them from their capital. As lately as January 1915 disaster was only averted by the intervention of our Indian troops. In fact, no Sultan for some generations has been able to establish or maintain his authority without our help. The title of the Sultan is, nowadays, properly Seyyid, not Imam, the Ibadhi sectaries, who predominate in the population of Oman, according the latter title to their ruler not of his right, but only if he be peculiarly competent in religious learning. At the present time the principal Ibadhi Sheikh has put up an Imam in the person of Salim ibn Rashid el-Kharusi of Tanuf (q. v.), in opposition to the Seyyid of Muscat. Our treaty relations with Muscat began in 1798, and the Sultan has been under a binding agreement with the Indian Government since 1891. It was in 1856 that Lord Canning mediated in the disputed succession occasioned by Sultan Sa'id's death after a reign of forty-eight years ; and, confirming Turki in possession of Muscat, assigned to the other claimant, his brother Majid, Zanzibar and other African possessions, which the late Sa'id had conquered. Majid entered into full possession four years later. The Sultan of Muscat receives a large annual subsidy, as well as a guarantee of protection, at the hands of the Indian Government, on condition of his observing the terms of the agreement of 1891, the most important of which are that he shall alienate no part of his territory except to the British, that he shall direct his policy in conformity with ours, and that he shall accept no help, pecuniary or other, from any other foreign power.71 OMAN, Sultanate of, continued. TEIMUR IBN FEISAL. Reigning Sultan. Born in 1886 ; eldest son of his pre decessor ; succeeded on October 4, 1913, and was recognized by the British and French Governments on November 15. He is not on very good terms with his uncle, Moh. Ibn Turki, who had expected to succeed his brother. He found his realm in a bad state, owing to recent friction over the ' arms traffic' which had strained relations with Great Britain ; also to decline of trade, to the rebellion under 'Abdullah es-Salimi and Salim ibn Rashid el-Kharusi (q.v.), and to the weakness of his pre decessor's rule. Friction ensued with the British Resident over the import of cartridges for the Beni Bu 'Ali at Sur ; but, after the banishment of 'Ali Musa Khan, the Baluch trader, this matter was smoothed over. The subsequent enforcement, however, of our restrictions on the arms traffic, under which munitions could be imported and exported through no other port than Muscat, and there only through a controlled warehouse, caused an acute crisis with the chiefs of the interior, who desired both arms and the profits to be made by the trade in them. A serious rebellion, fomented by an Ibadhi Sheikh, 'Abdullah es-Salimi (q.v.), broke out in May 1913, and raised nearly all Jebel Akhdhar against the Sultan. Nizwa fell in June, and Izki and 'Awabi a little later. The forts of Bidbid and Sema'il followed in August ; but meanwhile Indian troops had been landed and had occupied Beit el-Felej, near Matrah. In April 1915 we bombarded Barkah and Quryat, where the Beni Battash were giving trouble, and so checked the rebels that a truce was concluded. But in autumn the tribes began to gather again and Indian reinforcements were sent to Beit el-Felej. These foiled an attempt by 3,000 tribesmen on Muscat in January 1915 ; but the rebel party still dominates the interior. In July the Sultan went to Quryat and received the surrender of Heil and Daghmar in August. Sultan Teimur is a well-meaning, but apparently not very strong ruler. He has a young heir, born in 1910. Other members of the House of some importance are : MOHAMMED IBN FEISAL. Second son of the late, and brother of the reigning, Sultan of Oman ; he takes little part in the government, but is reputed the cleverest of his family. NADIR IBN FEISAL. Third son of the late Sultan of Oman. A man of character, who takes considerable part in the administration under his brother, and represents him in his absence (e.g. in July 1915).OMAN, Sultanate of, continued. Has the revenues of Sib and Barkah, and owns two ships. Only solvent member of his family. Rumour has it that his relations with the Sultan are not cordial. HAMID IBN FEISAL. Fourth son of the late Sultan of Oman ; his father's favourite, and regarded with some disfavour by his brothers, who have kept him in the background during the new reign. But in 1915 he was entrusted with the command against the Beni Battash, and decorated by the Sultan on their surrender. SALIM IBN FEISAL. \ oungest son of the late Sultan. Made Vali of Gwadar by his brother in November 1915. Quarrelled with the Hindu Community, which demanded his recall. Sultan promised it and recalled him in October (?). MOHAMMED IBN TURKI. Brother of the late, and uncle of the present, Sultan of Oman. Aggrieved at the succession of his nephew. DHI'AB IBN FAHHAD IBN XORKI. Nephew of the late, and first-cousin of the present Sultan. Educated in England, and considered likely to play a considerable part in the future. Married a sister of the Sultan on Sept. 6, 1915.

Ihe Sheikhs ol the six largest settlements on the ' Pirate Coast i. e. the coast from 'Odeid to Khor Kalba, which faces WNW. just within the entrance of the Gulf, and runs out in the Ras el-Jebel Peninsula to Ras Musandam. Geographically part of Oman, this coast and peninsula are politically independent. Ihe six Sheikhs are, theoretically, inde pendent also of one another ; but the Sheikh of SHARJAH claims suzerainty over Ras el-Kheimah and the whole apex of the peninsula down to Khor Kalba on the Oman coast, and also a certain authority over all the other five sheikhs. This claim, however, is not recognized by them or by us. Ihese settlements have been separately under treaty with us since 1820, when, after the conquest of Nejd by Egypt, the Wahabite influence declined in the district, and we took steps to check the piratical practices for which it was notorious. In 1853 the Chiefs were compelled to sign jointly a treaty of perpetual peace under our protection, and in 1892 to engage (like the Sultan of Oman) to admit relations with no other foreign power, or alienate territory except to us. Their subjects now live mainly by pearl-fishing. From west to east the settlements and their chiefs are : 1. ABU DHABI. Chief : HAMDAN IBN ZEID EL-KHALIFAH. Succeeded his brother Tahnun in 1912. A firm ruler who keeps good order, but has dabbled in the arms traffic under plea of the necessity of securing himself against Ibn Sa'ud, after the latter had conquered Hasa. In 1913 he negotiated a truce between the Sultan of Oman and the rebellious chiefs. His territory extends north-west to 'Odeid. 2. DIBAI. Chief : SATD IBN MAKHTUM. Succeeded in 1912 his cousin, Buti ibn Suheil, with whose family and the Bu Felasah clan he lives in continual feud. Had to be warned by the Indian Government in August 1913, after a boat of H.M.S. Sphinx had been fired upon from the town. He is one of the wealthiest of the Chiefs, Dibai having become the distributing centre for the district, and at one time a focus of the arms traffic. 3. SHARJAH. Head-quarters of the British Residential Agent for the whole district. Chief : KHALID IBN AHMED. Succeeded his cousin, Sagar ibn Khalid, in 1914. Chief of the Jawasim, and claimant to the whole Ras el-Jebel pen insula. Probably a stronger ruler than his predecessor, who was a smuggler of arms ; but too soon to judge. A. R74 4. 'AJMAN. Chief : HAMID IBN 'ABD EL-'AZIZ. Succeeded his murdered father in I9 I0 &gt; an&lt; i with Mohammed ibn Rashid, the murderer, and his family. Dependent to some extent on Dibai. An uncouth boor who has given us trouble about the arms traffic. 5. UMM EL-QAIWEIN. Chief : RASHlD IBN AHMED. At feud with his expelled half-brother, Nasir, who claims the chiefdom. A troublesome client of ours, who had to be coerced by a British squadron in March 1914. The piratical tradition is strongest here. 6. RAS EL-KHEIMAH. Chief: SALIM IBN SULTAN. Appointed, 1910, by his nephew, Sagar, then Sheikh of Sharjah; but not accepted by all the district, e.g. not by the islanders of Jezirat el-Hamra, nor immediately recognized as independent by the Indian Government. Since Sagar's death, however (1914), he has established himself firmly. Further, it should be noted that 'ABD ER-RAHlM, the Sheikh of HAMRlYAH, near Z5ra, nominally a vassal of Sharjah, but really independent since 1875, will probably be recognized as a seventh Irucial Chief by the Indian Government, if his conduct continues satisfactory (he commands Zora where it is proposed to erect a wireless installation; in February 1916 he definitely revolted against Sharjah, but was coerced into submission by H.M.S. Philomel). Other settlements likely also in the future to be so recognized are : FUJEIRAH. Chief : NASIR IBN SHAHIN ET-TAWAR. KHOR FAKKAN. Both on the east coast of the Ras el-Jebel peninsula. EL-QATAR (Peninsula), Ruler of. This district, ruled from Dohah, has been independent since the retirement of the Wahabites of Riyadh, about 1870; but D5hah was occupied by a Turkish military post up to 1914, when the troops, driven out of Hasa by Ibn Sa'ud in 1913, were cut off there, together with the remnant of the original garrison, by a British force. The Ottoman claim to El-Qatar, put forward since 1871, was never admitted by the Indian Government. We had an agreement with the Sheikh of the same kind as with the Trucial Chiefs up to 1882, when we allowed it to lapse ; but we now exercise an informal pro tectorate over El-Qatar. 'ABDULLAH IBN JASIM ETH-THANI. Ruler of El-Qatar ; second son of Sheikh Jashn ; succeeded his father in July 1913 ; formerly Governor of Dohah, and right-hand man of his father. Maintains good relations with the British, and is75 friendly with Ibn Sa'ud, as was his father, who acted more than once as the latter's agent in overtures to Indian Government. His elder brother, KHALlFAH, who supplanted him at Dohah in 1912 and resides in the Rumeilah quarter, is hostile to him, and so are his cousins, sons of Sh. Ahmed eth-Thani. Sheikh 'Abdullah has been friendly to us since the outbreak of war, but is not a very energetic ruler. On the outbreak of war with Turkey he acknowledged our Resident's announcement without comment. He conducted the negotiations with the Turkish garrison in August 1915, and was presented with the fort by H.M. Government after the surrender. A good deal of arms smuggling goes on at Dohah. BAHREIN, Ruler of. The Sheikhs of the Khalifah family of the 'Utub tribe, which seized Bahrein in 1782, have been in direct relations with us since 1805, and under treaty since 1820. But it was not till 1880 that the present ruler entered into a binding pact of the same kind as that afterwards accepted by the Sultan of Muscat (q.v.). A British Resident is stationed at Manamah, on the main island of the group. The present ruler owed his accession to our influence, and is supported by us against other claimants of the Khalifah family. He resides on Muharraq Island off Manamah for four summer months, and at Manamah the rest of the year. TSA IBN 'ALI EL-KHALlFAH, C.I.E., C.S.I. Succeeded in 1867, and is now an old man. Has always needed a firm hand to keep him up to his obligations, and has betrayed more than once a tendency to intrigue with the Ottoman power at the head of the Gulf. Is jealous of his independence, and slow to accept suggestions by the Resident, until these are pressed upon him with insistence ; but is an intelligent man who knows how far to go, and has, on the whole, administered his charge well, meeting with wisdom and energy the economic crisis in the pearl-fishing trade caused by the present war, which reduced his customs receipts 80 per cent. Later the plague caused much distress (spring 1915) and led to about 5,000 deaths. It ended in June. Sheikh Tsa has three sons : 1. HAMID, the heir apparent, a moderate man. Lives at a country house behind Manamah, near the palm-gardens. 2. MOHAMMED, who made the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1912. 3. 'ABDULLAH. KHALID IBN 'ALI EL-KHALlFAH. Brother of the ruling Sheikh, and virtually independent holder of the islands of Sitrah and Nebi Salih, together with the k 276 coastal villages on the E. side of Brahrein I., to the south of Khor el-Kabb, and, inland, the two Rifa's (east and west). The revenues of these places he enjoys absolutely. Lives in summer on Sitrah I., where he has a fortified house at Kharijiyah. KHALlFAH IBN HAMAD IBN MOHAMMED EL-KHALlFAH. An influential malcontent of the ruling house, who has in trigued with the Ottoman Government. At the end of 1911 he went to Constantinople to complain and solicit the Porte's interference in a suit between him and Sheikh 'Tsa, re property sequestered by the latter. Returned to Basra in 1912, and got the Vali to write to Sheikh 'Isa. The latter insisted on replying direct, despite the protest of our Resident that this course vio lated the Treaty of 1880. KOWEIT, SULTAN OF. The Khallfahs now ruling in Koweit are said to have been originally sheikhs of a small settlement at Umm Qasr, near Bandar Zobeir, on the Khor 'Abdullah. Expelled thence by the Turks in the earlier part of the eighteenth century, they built a fort (Kut or Kot) on the south shore of the Qrein (Grain) Inlet, which originated the name of Koweit (diminutive of Kut). In 1871, when Midhat Pasha, Vali of Baghdad, initiated a policy of Ottoman expansion in Arabia, and occupied Hasa, the Sheikh of Koweit was induced to declare himself an Ottoman subject, and accept the style of a Kaimmakam. But in 1899, when the project of a transcontinental railway from Constantinople via Baghdad had taken shape, and the question of its Gulf terminus had been raised, the Indian Government began to pay more par ticular attention to Koweit, and secured its own predominance by a treaty. Various attempts by the Turks to coerce Koweit directly or indirectly (through Ibn Rashid) were frustrated by us, and in 1907 we entered into a specific agreement with the late Sultan, Mubarak, under which we acquired a perpetual lease of the Bandar Shuweikh foreshore on the Qrein Inlet, and the right of pre-empting all and any of his territory which he should propose to alienate. In return we engaged to protect him against any aggression from without. A Political Resident had already (1904) been stationed at Koweit. Mubarak seems to have recognized Turkish authority when a Commission arrived early in 1914 to try to establish a modus vivendi for the Turks in East Arabia; but at the outbreak of the present war he formally repudiated all connexion with the Ottoman Government, which withdrew its detachment from Umm Qasr. Ihe Sultan of Koweit claims as his own the coast and islands from77 the head of the Khor 'Abdullah southward to Musallamiyah Bay. His inland boundary is undefined, but roughly may be said to follow the line dividing the Summan steppe from the Dahanah desert.

Succeeded, on November 28, 1915, his father, a strong ruler, who did much to improve his position and advance Koweit, and was long friendly to, and in treaty relations with us. Sultan Jabir has formally asked for a continuance of our protection and, at the end of December 1915, received Sir P. Cox and assured him of loyalty. He began his reign well by renouncing his claim to one-third of proceeds of sales of lands, .reducing the import duty on dates by one-half, and releasing all prisoners. His house has some authority with the 'Ajman Arabs, but is often at feud with them, and in Decem ber 1915 gave them notice (at Ibn Sa'ud's request) to leave Koweit territory. On this the tribe seems to have gone north to join Ibn Rashid. It can call, also, on some smaller tribal groups (e.g. of Hawazin, Muteir and Beni Khalid), which range near the capital; but its desert power is not considerable. Koweit is at virtually perpetual feud with the Muntefiq tribe (q.v.), and especially with that part of it which follows 'Ajeimi ibn Sa'dun (q.v.). With these used to go the Dhafir tribe, and some times the 'Alwi section of the Muteir tribe (see Feisal ed-Derwish), but both these appear now to be friendly with Koweit. Sultan Jabir's father also was engaged intermittently in hostilities with Ibn Rashid (q.v.), from whose attack a British landing-party saved him in 1905. With the Ibn Sa'uds (q.v.) his relations were fairly consistently good. He protected 'Abd el-'Aziz, the present ruler of78 Nejd and his father, 'Abd er-Rahman, in exile before 1902, and welcomed the former's attack on Hasa in 1913. Though somewhat affronted by the subsequent agreement (1914), under which Ibn Sa'ud accepted the title of Ottoman Vali of Nejd, its futility and the representations of our Resident prevented a breach. He was always on very friendly terms with Sheikh Khaz'al of Mohammarah, but had little communication with his distant relative. Sheikh Tsa of Bahrein (q.v.). The present Sultan is not on terms with Ibn Rashid, who would have attacked him directly after his accession, had the Dhafir agreed to co-operate. Sultan Jabir has a son, AHMED, who was in command of an expeditionary force against the 'Ajman in July 1915, and brothers : 1. SALIM. Long estranged from his father, and resident at Fantas, on the coast S. of Koweit ; reconciled in 1912 through the good offices of the Sheikh of Mohammarah. Of dissolute character.

Tsa had been a friend of the late Sultan of Oman, and treated with his successor, visiting Muscat with his brother 'Ali in December 1913, after a conference with other rebel chiefs at Sib. A truce was then patched up. Later, Tsa became one of the two chief lieutenants of the Imam ', and attacked Muscat in January 1915. He suffered heavy losses, which he retired to repair. He met our Resident at Sib on Sept. 15 but the conference came to nothing. In October he was preparing to attack Sur.

Sheikh, who rebelled against the Sultan of Muscat in 1910, and defeated his force near Sohar ; made peace on condition of receiving a subsidy (jointly with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi) in October.REGION VI CENTRAL ARABIA EMIRATE OF NEJD [IBN SA'ODS]. T he principality was founded about 1745 by Mohammed ibn Sa'ud, Sheikh of Dar'iyah in Wadi Hanlfah, said to be of the Hasanah tribe of the Anazah, and of honourable lineage. He was the earliest important convert made by Mohammed ibn 'Abd el-Wahhab, the ascetic revivalist of Hareimlah (Ayaina), and it was with his sword that Wahabism was propagated throughout the Nejdean oases. His son, 'Abd el-'Aziz, and his grandson, Sa'ud, pushed religious conquest afield, to Kerbela on the one hand, to the Red Sea on the other, and almost to Damascus in the north ; and when Sa'ud died in 1814, he was acknowledged by almost all Arabia except Yemen and the districts south of the Great Desert. Sa'ud's successor, 'Abdullah, however, lost to the Egyptian forces of Ibrahim Pasha all that his ancestors had gained. In 1818 Dar'iyah was destroyed, and the Emir taken prisoner to Cairo. From that date till 1849 the Emirate remained more or less dependent on Egypt ; but thenceforward, under Feisal, it recovered freedom of action in its new capital, Riyadh. In the meantime, however, a rival Emirate had arisen under 'Abdullah ibn Rashid in Ha'il, which soon grew strong enough to de tach Jebel Shammar altogether from the Nejdean domain, and to dispute the possession of Qaslm. By 1872, moreover, the Ibn Sa'uds' dominion on the Gulf coast, which had been reasserted by 'Abdullah, son of Feisal, was lost, and the Emir could claim jurisdiction only over the southern group of oases with an undefined environment of steppe and desert. This first long struggle between the rival Emirates, lasting nearly fifty years, was decided in favour of Ha'il. Riyadh was taken in 1886 by Mohammed ibn Rashid, and again in 1891 ; and for ten years following Nejd remained in vassalage to Jebel Shammar, Riyadh suffering much at the hands of the Rashldites. In 1902, however, the present Emir returned from Koweit, drove out the Rashidites, and established himself. He rebuilt Riyadh, and has since recovered both Qasim and Hasa, which last region he had avowedly been coveting since 1906, as the only territory, once belonging to Nejd, which could restore the finances of the Emirate. He is, therefore, master now of a much larger territory than the Emir of Ha'il, and is one of the two most powerful independent potentates in Arabia. The basis of the Nejdean Emir's power is both religious and secular He is the recognized champion of Wahabism, and he commands the population of the most thickly inhabited settled districts in Central Arabia,84 EMIRATE OF NEJD, continued. as well as certain nomad and half-settled tribes (see infra). Since 1842 Nejd has remained free both of direct Ottoman interference and of the active influence of the Emir of Mecca. Its rulers ha\^ made various over tures to the Indian Government. An agreement was reached in 1866 about the irucial Coast and Oman, and the immunity of British subjects generally from molestation ; but it lapsed about 1882 and was not re newed till lately. After various proposals, a Political Officer was allotted to Nejd in 1914. Captain Shakespear, however, who undertook the duty, was killed in March 1915, in the course of a light between forces of the two Emirs near Mejma', and no successor has been appointed. At one time (1905) Ibn Sa'iid recognized the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, and in 1914 he accepted the title Vali of Nejd. But he has never taken this title seriously, and he entered into binding treaty obligations with the Indian Government in the autumn of 1915, disowning all relations with the Turks. 'ABD EL-'AZIZ IBN 'ABD ER-RAHMAN. Succeeded as Emir of Riyadh and all Nejd in 1902 ; pre viously a refugee among the north-eastern tribes and, with his fathei, at Koweit, whence he set out with a small force of only about forty men, after the murder of his uncle, the vassal Emir, by Ibn Rashid's order. He collected adherents in N. Nejd (Sedeir and Aridh), driving out the Rashldite officials, and was welcomed in Riyadh. In 1903 occupied Qasim, and in 1904 defeated Ibn Rashld and a lurkish contingent near Boreidah. In 1905 he was driven back to Nejd by Ahmed Feizi Pasha's force, but in 1906 recovered Qasim and expelled all the Turks. In 1910 he had to meet an act of aggression on the part of the Sherif of Mecca, who sent a force into Qasim and seized his bi other, Sa d ; but he quickly got the upper hand and induced the Sherif s army to withdraw without effecting anything. By 1912 he had formed a large tribal confederacy including the Muteir, Sebei , Sahul, and Ahl Murrah, and after testing it in a raid upon the Ateibah, who had harboured certain malcontent relatives of his own, known as the ' Aulad Sa'ud ' (expelled from Hariq), he descended in 1913 on Hasa, took Hofuf on May 5 almost without resistance, and Qatif ten days later. The Turkish Governor and his 500 soldiers were sent down to 'Oqair, whence they proceeded to El-Qatar. Once in possession of Hasa, Ibn Sa'ud made overtures to us, and our Political Agents at Bahrein and Koweit went to Oqair to meet him in December. Early in the following year the Porte recognized the fait accompli by sending a Commission to meet Ibn Sa'ud near Koweit, and styling him Vali of Nejd. But he continued to invite closer relations with the Indian Government, and cordially received Shakespear when sent up to him as Political Officer at the end of the year.85 EMIRATE OF NEJD, continued. In the tribal fighting, which followed the outbreak of the European War, Ibn Sa'ud consistently opposed Ibn Rashid and his pro-Turk federation ; but was not able to subdue Jebel Shammar, and fought no better than a drawn battle with Ibn Rashid at Mejma' in Sedeir in March 1915. Since then his relations with his rival have not greatly improved, in spite of a formal peace concluded in the summer at the instance of the Sherif's son, 'Abdullah, who arrived with a large escort to collect the Sherif's dues, agreed upon under the pact of 1910. In the summer of 1915 he had serious trouble in N. Hasa with the power ful 'Ajman tribe. He experienced reverses at the outset, lost his brother. Sad, and was himself wounded in a skirmish; but in the end he got the 'Ajman under, inflicted very serious punishment, and prevailed on the Sultan of Koweit to withdraw his protection from them. Subsequently he had to deal similarly with the Ahl Murrah, who had been incited by his rebellious kinsman, Suleiman (see Aulad Sa'ud). The Emir is a man of about 40 years of age, six feet high and broad in proportion, of kindly face and simple manners ; intelligent, energetic, and warlike. He has been described as, in appearance, a typical Arab chief. He shows great philopro- genitiveness, marrying one wife after another, and giving each away, either at once or after her first child is weaned, to other sheikhs or followers. He adheres to the pro-British and anti- 1 urk traditions of his house, and at the end of 1915 signed a definite treaty with Sir P. Cox, acting on behalf of the Indian Government, of the same kind as those in force with Gulf poten tates. L nder this we engage to protect him against aggression (' by the subjects of any foreign power '), while he, for his part, must follow our policy in Arabia and in regard to Turks. He was friendly with the late Sultan Mubarak of Koweit (though he was not very honestly dealt with by that astute prince), and remains so with Sultan Jabir, and he is sympathetic to Idrlsi ; and he keeps on terms of courtesy, and even friendship at present, with the Emir of Mecca (though each depreciates the other to us). As for Ibn Rashid, war alternates with armed neutrality ; and relations have not been improved by the defection of several Shammar Sheikhs to the Sa'ud flag. Ibn Rashid, in an Agreement signed on June 10,1915, recog nized the following tribes as in Ibn Sa'ud's sphere of influence : Muteir, Ateibah, Harb, B. 'Abdullah, 'Ajman, Ahl Murrah, Manaslr, B. Hajir (Hajar), Sebei', Sahul, Qahtan, and Dawasir. But this must not be taken to imply that Ibn Sa'ud really controls all these tribes; it means merely that Ibn Rashid disclaims in fluence over them. The Ateibah and Harb, for example, acknow ledge no authority but that of the Emir of Mecca.86 EMIRATE OF NEJD, continued, 'ABD ER-RAHMAN IBN FEISAL. Youngest son of the famous Emir who received Palgrave and Pelly, and father of the ruling Emir. Attempted to es tablish himself as Emir in 1891, and imprisoned Ibn Rashid's governor, but was driven out of Riyadh and escaped first to Hasa, then to Koweit. He stayed at Koweit till 1902, when he returned to Nejd to live under his son. Acted as the Emir's representative in a conference with the Vali of Basra and the Sultan of Koweit in 1905. Is styled 'Imam', and has the direction of religious affairs in Riyadh, though his son, the Emir, usually leads the prayer. An old man, born about 1850, tall, keen-eyed, dignified, white-bearded, of pleasant manners, who was very cordial to Captains Leachman and Shakespear, and helped Raunkiaer. He is a firm believer in Great Britain, and has a wide acquaintance with Arab politics. TORKI IBN 'ABD EL-'AZIZ. Eldest son of the ruling Emir, about 20 years of age. Appointed by his father to lead a considerable raid from Qasim into Jebel Shammar in spring 1916. Reached Jebel Selmah and obtained much booty of live-stock. Ibn Rashld was absent in the north at the time. AULAD SA'UD (or 'ARA'IF). (irandsons of the Emir Sa'iid ibn Feisal, who was an elder brother of 'Abd er-Rahman. They claim the Emirate for the elder branch of Feisal's descendants, and, in 1910, attempted to raise Kharj, Hariq, and Hautah against 'Abd el-'Aziz. They were unsuccessful, and fled to Hasa and to the Ateibah. Later, when Ibn Sa'ud harried the Ateibah and occupied Hasa (1913), some of the rebels took refuge with the Sherif and some with Sheikh Tsa of Bahrein. Two of the latter, Suleiman and Fahhad, left Bahrein in 1915 ostensibly for Oman, but they seem to have landed at Abu Dhabi and gone to 'Odeid, whence they intended to raid into Hasa. But Suleiman was defeated near 'Oqair, and returned to Abu Dhabi in November 1915. Expelled thence, he joined the Ahl Murrah, and thence fled to El-Qatar. Fahhad was killed.87 SA'UD FAMILY 'A bdullah (1865-70, 1874- c. 1891). M ohammed I bn S a'ud (Disciple of Mohammed ibn 'Abd el-Wahhab). 'A bd el-' A ziz (1765-1802). Q ). oa ud (1802-14).

This Principality was founded by an 'Abdah Shammar Sheikh, 'Ab dullah ibn Rashid, who in 1835 was made Governor of Ha'il by the Emir Feisal of Riyadh. Previously (since the last years of the eighteenth century) all Jebel Shammar had been under Nejd, and most recently under Egyptian overlordship. Abdullah did not, however, throw off his dependence at once, but greatly increased his power during Feisal's detention for five years in Cairo, and dying in 1847, left his successor, Telal, virtually free of Nejd. The latter's successor, Mohammed, the strongest native ruler seen in Arabia in the nineteenth century, consolidated his principality, and not only maintained complete independence but formed the greatest confederacy of tribes ever collected, and in 1892 conquered all the do minions of Nejd, and ruled as sole Emir of Central Arabia till his death in 1897. How Nejd recovered independence five years later has been told under 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn 'Abd er-Rahman. Since that time Jauf also has been lost to Nuri esh-Sha'lan (q.v.), and, despite active Turkish support in 1904—5, no territory has been permanently added. 1 lie Emirate, therefore, is confined to Jebel Shammar, i.e. the steppe and hill country round the capital, Ha'il, with the Southern and Eastern Nefud, and Teima. The basis of Rashid power is tribal. The great Bedouin clans of the88 Southern Shammar support it ; but, like most powers which have any duration in Arabia, it rests in the first instance on a paid force of pro fessional soldiers, the camelry known as the rajdjil, who number about 500 men. The Ibn Rashids maintain closer relations with the Ottoman Govern ment than do any other independent Arabian princes; and the House has also been consistently friendly with the Sherifate of Mecca. Besides the Emir of Nejd, its most constant foes are the Sultan of Koweit, Nuri esh-Sha'lan of the Ruweilah Anazah, and Hamud ibn Suweit of the Dhafir tribe. Nor is it on cordial terms with Ajeimi ibn Sa'dun of the Muntefiq. The Rashld House is accounted infamous,- even in such a land of violence as Arabia, for its record of domestic murders. Another noble Shammar family, the SUBHANS, is very intimately connected with it, and shares its notoriety. Besides having supplied viziers to the Rashids for nearly a century, it has so often intermarried with the latter that its members are now of almost as genuine princely blood. One Subhan woman, Mudhi (q.v.), for example, has been married successively to three Rashids (two Emirs) and one Subhan. Therefore the two families will be considered together, and a genealogical table will be appended of each. It will be observed that Sa'ud, the ruling Emir, appears in both genealogies. SA'UD IBN 'ABD EL-'AZiZ. Emir of Ha'il and Jebel Shammar since 1908. Son of 'Abd el-'Aziz, who reigned from 1897 to 1906, when he was killed in battle against the combined forces of the Muteir and Ibn Sa'ud of Riyadh. 'Abd el-'Aziz was succeeded by his son Mit'ab, who before he had reigned a year was murdered by a cousin, Sultan ibn Hamud er-Rashld. Sultan was then killed by his brother, Sa'ud ibn Hamud, but the latter in his turn was murdered in 1908, at the instigation of Hamud ibn Subhan, who brought back his nephew, Sa ud ibn 'Abd el- Azlz, from Mecca, where he had been sent for safety, and set him up as Emir. Sa'ud's mother, Mudhi bint Subhan (q.v.), was first married to the Emir Mohammed er-Rashid, who died in I ^97- his death she married 'Abd el-'Aziz, his successor and nephew. The Emir Sa'ud, therefore, cannot be more than twenty-one. He has, however, his full complement of wives, who have borne him at least two sons. His uncle, Hamud, died in 1907, leaving a distant cousin, Zamil es-Subhan, to succeed him in his role of monitor and vizier. Zamil was murdered in 1914 under circumstances of peculiar atrocity, and his place in the counsels of the Emir was taken by another of the Subhan house, Sa ud ibn Salih (q.v.), reported murdered in his turn in early autumn, 1916.89 EMIRATE OF JEBEL SHAMMAR, continued. Ihe Emir Sa'ud is said to be an irresponsible boy of boorish manners and violent and ungovernable passions, verging on madness. He has a reputation for cruelty, and, even in Arabia, is accounted shifty and faithless. An envoy, sent to him from Basra, described him as a ' jungle youth '. A Shammari, formerly of his following, but now Governor under Ibn Sa'ud, of Jalajil in Nejd, said to Shakespear in 1914, that Sa'ud showed no sign of being a man beyond having got a son. He has failed to recapture the oasis of Jauf from Nuri esh-Sha'lan (q.v.), but has maintained his position against Ibn Sa'ud, and the tradi tional relations of his house with the Ottoman Government. He has representatives in Damascus, Constantinople, Baghdad, and Nejef. His friendship with the Ottoman Sultan has been rewarded by large presents of arms, by a considerable sum of money sent up with Eshref Bey early in 1915, and by the title of Pasha. Between Jebel Shammar and Koweit there is a veiled hostility ; but in 1914 Sa'ud was on good terms with the Muntefiq. Early in 1916 he moved north to Leinah, and his movements and the help given by him to those buying camels for the Turks at £T.io each, caused us to warn him that his food-caravans would not be allowed, in future, to buy in the Euphrates Valley markets, till his attitude was more satisfactory. He continued, however, to threaten the Shatt el-'Arab and Koweit, and camped near Safwan in June. He decamped at our threat of taking action, but went north and tried to harry Dhari et-Tuwalah of the Aslam Shammar, but was driven off. He declared himself an Ottoman vassal, ready to co-operate with the Turks if they should push south, but ready to keep the peace meanwhile, if allowed to buy in the Euphrates markets. He showed much animosity towards the Sheikh of Zobeir. In August he was reported to have returned to Ha'il, and later he appears to have given active assistance to the Turks in Hejaz, both by providing camels and by sending raiding parties against the Emir of Mecca's adherents. Since the loss of Jauf, his only outlying possession of importance is Teima. In 1914 Qasim had ceased to recognize his authority, and the towns of Boreidah and Aneizah pay tribute to Ibn Sa'ud. In 1915 Ibn Rashid tried to regain Qasim without success, and in 1916 that province was used as a base by lurki ibn Sa'ud for raiding his country. Between leima and Ha'il, the Bishr tribes pay him a small tribute ; but the Huteim have made the passage of caravans dangerous, carrying their raiding expeditions almost to the gates of Ha'il. On the NE. the pasturing grounds of the Shammar tribes and the caravan tracks to Nejef are constantly raided by the Dhafir. a. m90 EMIRATE OF JEBEL SHAMMAR, continued. The Emir draws his fighting men both from the Shammar tribes, who are devotedly loyal, and from the villagers of the small oases round Ha'il. One authority states that he can muster, mount, and arm 20,000 (?) men ; but Doughty put Mohammed er-Rashld's force in his annual raids at only about 800, which was the number the Emir Sa'ud was said to have with him in 1914 in his campaign against Nuri esh-Sha'lan. Doughty reckoned that Mohammed could, at the most, mount and arm 3,300 men, of which some 600 were drawn from tribes which are no longer under the control of his successor. Doughty's estimate is probably under the mark, but it can only be by very exceptional stress that Ibn Rashid can muster anything like 10,000 armed men. The Emir Sa'ud is, virtually, the last of his blood-stained race, except his own infants. The only members of the family, therefore, to be considered are rather Subhans than Rashids. DHARI IBN FAHD IBN 'UBEID ER-RASHlD. Fled from Ha'il, 1908, when the Emir Sa'ud was murdered. Tried to seize the Emirate, killing three male Rashids (grandsons of Hamud?) who stood between him and the succession; but failed. Still, however, maintains his pretensions. Left wife, son and daughter in Ha'il, and fled to Riyadh and became right- hand man of Ibn Sa'ud. Tuberculous and was treated at Bombay for four months and afterwards by the American doctor, von Vlach of Bahrein. Now cured. Of much repute among Arabs and trusted by Ibn Sa'ud ; said to be of capacity and judgement. His younger brother, FEISAL, aged 25, is also with Ibn Sa'ud and in his confidence. Both brothers were seen by Shakespear at Koweit after their flight. FATIMAH. Widow of Subhan, vizier of the Emir Mohammed, and grandmother of the present Emir, Sa'ud, whose mother is her daughter Mudhi. An old woman of strong character and con siderable political influence. In 1914 she held the keys of the Treasury during the Emir's absence. No decision could be taken without her consent, and though, nominally, the administration of Ha'il was in the hands of Ibrahim es-Subhan (murdered in May 1914), she was de facto governor. Said to have great authority over the Emir. She rules the women of the Palace with a rod of iron. NDRAH BINT 'ABD EL-'AZlZ. Half-sister of the Emir Sa'ud. She was married first to Hamud es-Subhan, who brought back his nephew, the young91 Emir Sa'ud, from Mecca, and set him upon the throne in 1908. By him she has three sons, 'Ali, Mohammed, and Mit'ab. The two eldest boys, aged about 13 and 14, are treated with great respect in Ha'il as the grandsons of the Emir 'Abd el-'Aziz. Hamud died in 1909, and Nurah married her brother-in-law, Sa'ud ibn Salih es-Subhan, the murderer of Zamil and Ibrahim. By him she has a son, born in 1913. If it is true that Sa'ud has been murdered, she is once more a widow. She is a pretty woman, but without political influence. MUDHI BINT SUBHAN. Daughter of Subhan, vizier to the Emir Mohammed, and of Fatimah. She was married first to the Emir Mohammed. On his death in 1897, she married the Emir 'Abd el-'Aziz, to whom she bore a son, Sa'ud, the present Emir. She became the wife of Sultan er-Rashid, who was murdered by his brother Sa'ud, and subsequently, of Zamil es-Subhan, mur dered in 1914. By the latter she had a child. She is still a beautiful and gracious woman, but she has no political influence, being completely dominated by her mother Fatimah (q.v.). SA'UD IBN SALIH ES-SUBHAN. Brother-in-law of the Emir Sa'ud, and vizier; of consider able wealth. Married to Nurah, half-sister of the Emir (q.v.). He instigated the murder of Zamil es-Subhan and his brother Ibrahim in 1914, having bought over the rajajil. The Emir's jealousy had been excited by reports of invidious comparisons drawn by the Shammar between himself and Zamil, to whom, in the first instance, he had owed his throne. He therefore acquiesced in the murder, riding on ahead while it was being perpetrated, and he accepted Sa'ud as vizier in the room of his victim. [Reported killed in September 1916.] 'ABBAS EL-FALEIJI. Of Boreidah in Qaslm ; the richest local merchant. 'ABD EL-'AZIZ HAMOD. One of the Emir of Ha'il's rajajil, and his agent in Damascus. 'Abd el-'AzIz is familiar with Constantinople, where he has been sent on the Emir's business. He was there during the Balkan War. 'ABD EL-'AZIZ IBN SA'lD. Governor of Jalajil in Sedeir for Ibn Sa'ud. A Shammari tribes man. About 32 years of age ; tall and of fine presence. Formerly governor for Ibn Sa'ud in Hasa, and before that one of Ibn Rashld's men in Ha'il. Spoke disparagingly of the Emir Sa'ud to Shakespear. M 294 'ABDULLAH IBN 'ASKAR. Governor of Mejma', capital of Sedeir, for Ibn Sa'ud. Hospitably entertained Shakespear in March 1913 in a line house, having known him previously in Koweit. So again in 1914. Has a son, 'Abd el-'Aziz. His brother was killed at the capture of Qatif in 1913. 1 he 'Askar house was formerly attached to Ibn Rashid, and Mejma' resisted the present Emir of Riyadh for some four years, submitting finally on condition of retaining an autonomy under its 'Askar Emirs similar to that enjoyed by Aneizah in Qasim. It remains disaffected to Ibn Sa'ud and a focus of Rashidite influence. 'ABDULLAH IBN EL-JALAL. One of the rajdjil of the Emir of Ha'il, and a man of some im portance. In 1914 he was entrusted with the fetching from Meda'in Salih of a large consignment of arms, which was sent down from Damascus in February by the Hejaz Railway. He had requi sitioned 1,000 camels for this purpose (50 rifles is a camel load), but had succeeded in obtaining only 400. (N.B.—These are Arab figures, and are probably exaggerated.) 'ABDULLAH EL-KHALlFAH. Of Boreidah. A fat and greasy Arab who once kept a shop in Cairo. Becoming bankrupt, he worked his way as a fireman to New York, and there drove a hackney. Saved about £1,000, and returned to Boreidah. Has since made more money, e. g. at Bombay in 1913, and is now rich and of much consideration. 'ABDULLAH IBN SALMAN. Of Zilfi. Formerly governor for Ibn Sa'ud ; now superseded by 'Ali ibn Badah (q. v.), but still the man of most local influence. 'ABDULLAH IBN SA'lD, D r. Of Aneizah in Qasim. The best-known native physician in Central Arabia. Trained in Beirut and Constantinople. Attended Ibn Sa'ud in his 'Ajman campaign in summer 1915 and was wounded. Had 400 wounded to deal with. Went to Bombay in December to procure medicines and instruments. 'ABDULLAH IBN ZAMIL. Of Aneizah in Qasim ; brother of the ruling Emir of the town. AHMED ETH-THANAYYAN. Of Riyadh. Bom of a Circassian mother. Was educated in Constantinople, and speaks French well. A relative of the Emir, who joined in receiving Leachman. Descended from Ibn Thanayyan,95 grandson of the Emir 'Abd el-'Aziz I. This man ruled Nejd during Emir Feisal's captivity, and, on the latter's return in 1849, tried to exclude him, but was betrayed by Ibn Suweilim. 'ALI IBN BADAH. Governor of Zilfi (both towns, Shamaliyah and J umbra). About 18 years of age ; pleasant manners. Appointed by Ibn Sa ud in 1912, after the murder of his uncle. Lives in Zilfi Shamaliyah. Received Shakespear in 1914 very hospitably. DHARI IBN BARGHASH ET-TUWALAH. Paramount Chief of the Aslam section of the Shammar, which ranges near 'Iraq, the chief being usually in the vicinity of Cha'bdah. It is at enmity with the 'Abdah and Ibn Rashid, and friendly with the Sinjarah and 1 uman sections. At present Dhari is allied with us. About 30 years of age, good looking with straightforward determined mien ; not given to superfluous compliments. A friend of Nawwaf ibn Nuri esh-Sha'lan (q. v.). He has fought Ibn Rashid on more than one occasion. FAHHAD IBN MA'MIR. (Former ?) Emir of Boreidah, appointed by Ibn Sa'ud. A weak man of disagreeable appearance and manners, who gave Raunkiaer trouble in 1912, and was only tolerably civil to Shakespear in 1914. Under the influence of negro slaves. The Ma'mir family is of old standing in Nejd, having been sheikhs in Wadi Hanifah before the establishment of the Sa'ud Emirate. FEISAL IBN SULTAN ED-DERWlSH. The most powerful Muteir sheikh. Chief of the 'Alwi sub- tribe. Fat, but energetic and warlike. Fought Ibn Rashid in the spring of 1915, and afterwards tried to come to terms with Ibn Sa'ud. Had relations with Shakespear at Koweit. Of considerable reputation in the desert as a raider and, perhaps, the same Feisal, who exacted dues from Raunkiaer's caravan on its way from Koweit to Zilfi in 1912. IBN HAYA. A family of some importance at Aneizah. One of the brothers was killed by the former Emir of Aneizah, 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Suleim ; two of the others, Salih Haya and Hamad, together with a nephew, Ibrahim, were living in dudgeon at Ha'il in 1914. Ibn Sa'ud had offered them blood money which they refused, saying that they must have a life. They intended to join a raiding expedition, which was to be sent out from Ha'il against Aneizah in the autumn of 191:4, but it was generally believed that when they had taken their revenge for the slain, they would declare in favour of Ibn Sa 'ud.96 MAHD IBN SA'UD. Emir of Shaqrah (Woshm); received Leachman in 1912 and Shakespear in 1914 hospitably. Not bigoted. Now subservient to Riyadh, but formerly hostile (Shaqrah resisted the Emir for 45 days). A young man of pleasant manners and enlightened views. No rela tion of the Emirs of Riyadh. MAS'UD ES-SUWEILIM. Of Riyadh. Representative of a wealthy noble house, de scended directly from the first Mohammed ibn Sa'iid. An ancestor, Ibn Suweilim, delivered up the usurper, Ibn Thanayyan, to Emir Eeisal in 1849. Mas'ud, who had been Ibn Sa'ud's envoy to our Resident at Koweit in 1906, met and entertained Shakespear at Riyadh in 1914. Early in 1915 he was sent again to Koweit to ask help from Sultan Mubarak against the rebellious 'Ajman, and was successful. He returned by Bahrein. SA'D IBN 'ABD EL-MUHSIN ES-SEDEIRI. Governor of Ghat in Sedeir ; nearly related to Ibn Sa'ud on the mother's side. Man of about 45, thin and wizened. Barely civil to Raunkiaer in 1912, but received Shakespear well in 1914. Was at the capture of Hofuf (Hasa) by Ibn Sa'ud in 1913. % SA'ID EL-MOHAMMED. Head eunuch of the palace at Ha'il, a position he has occupied since the days of the Emir Mohammed. A coal-black negro of villainous aspect. He is the agent of Fatimah, the grandmother of the Emir Sa'ud, and has considerable power. He enjoys great con sideration in the town. SALIH IBN ZAMIL. Emir of Aneizah in Qashn, elected by the townsmen. An oldish man, not bigoted. Of pleasant manners and real influence. Very cordial to Shakespear in 1914. Son of the famous Emir who received Doughty in 1878, consistently upheld the liberties of Aneizah against Mohammed er-Rashid, and was the most redoubt able warrior in Arabia. TURKlYAH. A Circassian slave girl, one of the four sent by the Sultan 'Abd el- Hamid to Mohammed er-Rashid. She was married by Mohammed before his death to one of his rajajil, 'Ubeid el-Gharamil, brother to the standard-bearer of the Hajj, and was given a house in Ha'il as a marriage portion. She is a woman of quick intelligence, with some influence in the palace, especially among the harim, by whom her knowledge of Constantinople and the outer world is much appreciated.REGION VII SYRIAN DESERT AND SINAI ABU JABIR. A family of Christians of Nazarene origin, now settled at Salt, and owning lands on the Hajj Railway north of Jizah, at \ adudah. There the two brothers, ABU SALIH FREH and ABU SA'ID FERHAN, have built a substantial stone house. They are men of intelligence and great physical vigour, well known and much respected in the desert on account of the unlimited hospitality which they extend to the tribes. 1 hey are anxious to improve the cultivation of their lands, and complain bitterh of the hindrances which the Ottoman Government puts in their wa}, and the complete lack of protection which it affords. At Jmveidah, three or four miles from Yadudah, another of the family, SELIM ABU JABIR, has a farm, while farther south, at Urum Kundum, the BISHARRA family, related by marriage to the Abu Jabir, have a large farm. A notable group of sturdy cultivators, holding their own against the tribes. One of the Bisharra sons, Hanna, was educated in Switzerland, and has taken an agricultural degree. Another Christian, Nimrud Hasan, has a small farm at Tneib, SE. of Urum Kundum. Tneib is about the limit of possible cultivation, owing to the lack of rain farther east. 'AJEIMI IBN SA'DUN. Most influential Chief among the Muntefiq. Succeeded his father (put to death at Aleppo) in 1911. Not so powerful with the various sections of this much subdivided tribal group as his father. At first anti-Turk, and had designs on Basra. Was forestalled by our advance in 1915, and turned against us; but lost much prestige by inaction at the battle of Sheiba. Since then has been hostile but ineffective. Has operated against the Sultan of Koweit. A man of bad reputation among Arabs. 'ALT IBN SULEIMAN ESH-SHARQI. One of the Paramount Sheikhs of the Uuleim. He is on excel lent terms with the Government; but moments of tension are apt to occur when his people raid the Euphrates caravan road. The Du- leim were put down with a strong hand by Nazim Pasha in 1910-11. Jemal, Nazim's successor as Vali of 'Iraq, struck up a friendship, however, with 'Ali Suleiman, and gave him a general invitation to visit him in Constantinople. 'Ali Suleiman owns cultivated lands and a house at Rumadi. He is a man of mediocre wits, but has98 inherited a considerable position from his father, who was a notable strong man in the desert. The Duleim maintain friendly relations with the 'Amarat. FAHD BEY IBN 'ABD EL-MUHSIN EL-HADHDHAL. Paramount Chief of the 'Amarat. A man over 60, not very intelligent ; a pan-Arabist, who hates the Turks for personal reasons, having been imprisoned by them at Mosul more than once. He owns profitable palm-gardens at Ghazazah near Kerbela, and has planted lands on the Euphrates at Bagdad. He is much respected in the desert, but is now old and timid, pre-occupied by anxieties about his settled property, the value of which, he fears, may be diminished by the opening of the Hindlyah Escape. It is essential for him to remain on good terms with whoever controls the water of the Euphrates. Rules about 3,000 tents. (See also p. 107.) FAWWAZ IBN TELAL. Eldest son of Telal ibn Fa'iz abu Meshkur, and almost as influential as his father with the Beni Sakhr. Accepted office under the Turks as Kaimmakam of Jizah, but is believed to be pan-Arab. A secretive man of about 35 ; moderately intelligent, energetic, and untrustworthy. (See also p. 113 f.) GHALIB IBN MIT'AB EL-QANJ. Chief of the Serdiyah, who are an offshoot of the B. Sakhr, but independent and usually at feud with the latter, and always with the Ruweilah. Ghalib is on good terms with the Turkish authorities, and was favoured by Sami Pasha in 1911. He has many friends in Damascus, and is said by them to be a sound Arab Unionist. He commands about 150 tents. His importance, however, is not measured by these. His grandfather, famous for his giant strength, made a name in the desert which still counts for much. The grandson, however, is less active and formidable, and inclines perforce to the Turks in self-defence. (See also p. 114.) HAKIM (pron. HACHIM) IBN MUHEID. Chief of the Dhana Kuheil section of the Fed'an. Next to Nuri esh-Sha'lan of the Ruweilah, perhaps the most powerful of the Anazah Chiefs, and certainly abler than he. Age about 40. Intelligent, very open-minded, fond of money, and vain ; anti- Turk and pan-Arab. Loves politics and his own free-will. Rules about 2,000 tents. (See also p. 107.) HAMAD ES-SUFI. Of the Terabin tribe of N. Sinai and lives at Beersheba. Chief of the Najamat sub-tribe of the Terabin and also of the small Haiwat99 tribe. Active in helping Turkish propaganda in autumn 1914, and claims to have been made a Pasha. He has a stone house, and is local Mayor (Ra'is el-Belediyah), but possesses only about 20 camels ; age about 70. His son, Jadira, age about 30, has no great influence outside his own tribe. Hamad's father was killed by the Abu Sittah, another Terabln sub-tribe, and Hamad has a blood-feud with them. His authority is not widely recognized outside his own sub-tribe, and the Haiwat. Afraid of the Turks, and in December 1915 was said to have become disaffected towards them, and to have refused to put his men into Turkish uniform. HAMUD 1BN SUWEIT. Paramount Chief of the Dhafir tribe. About 40 years of age, intelligent and reputed a good tribal administrator and politician. An old foe of Ibn Rashid, who refused the latter's invitation to join in a campaign during the winter 1915-16 against the rulers of Koweit and Riyadh. Recently (early 1916) he has mobilized his tribesmen together with the Bedur (a half-settled tribe of some 30,000 souls who live between Khidhr and Suq esh-Shuyukh) in the desert, west of Suq esh-Shuyukh, to counteract any movement of Ibn Rashid or 'Ajeimi of the Muntefiq against us in Mesopotamia. He has been attacked by the Shammar and the 'Ajman; but, though worsted, has been able to defeat 'Ajeimi. Ibn Sa'ud himself recommended our enlist ing him on our side. He controls about 2,500 tents. (See also p. 137.) HUSEIN IBN HUMEITAH. Chief of the Sa'udin sub-tribe of the Huweitat, between Ma'an and Akaba. Reported a brave honest man, who can obtain a large number of camels, at need, from the main body of the Huweitat. MOHAMMED IBN TURKI IBN MIJLAD. Chief of the Dahamishah sub-tribe of the 'Amarat and has some authority over the whole tribe. Said to control 1,200 tents. MOHAMMED PASHA JERUDI. Hereditary Chief of the oasis of Jerud ; he has a house in Damascus where he spends the winter, and is very well known. He is of Anazah stock, a man verging on 70, fat and infirm. He breeds horses, and maintains good relations with the tribes. Has been a source of considerable trouble to the Ottoman Government, but is nevertheless useful as an intermediary with the tribes. It is owing to his position in the desert that he has enjoyed more clemency than he deserves. Wealthy and avaricious. N 2100 MOHAMMED, SHEIKH OF TADMOR. A fine looking man who has been in Europe, and maintains constant relations with H. M. Consulate at Damascus. A settled Arab who controls the Ottoman Mudir of Tadmor, and makes money out of the traffic on the road from Hit to Damascus, but has no tribal influence. NAWWAF IBN NORI ESH-SHA'LAN. Son of the paramount chief of the Ruweilah, and governor of Jauf since it was taken from Ibn Rashld. A man of considerable intelligence and some education ; regarded by the pan-Arab party in Damascus as a staunch adherent and a valuable ally, but subsidized by the Turks (^T. 4,000?). Sheltered refugees from Syria in the winter of 1915-16. His reputation bids fair to eclipse that of his father. In his absence, his little son, SULTAN, received Shakespear at Jauf in 1914. (See also p. 106.) NUR1 BEY ESH-SHA'LAN. Paramount Chief of the Ruweilah. Perhaps the most powerful individual chief among the Bedouins. Reported to have been ordered in August 1914 not to go to the desert, but to collect camels for the Turks ; seems to have supplied a considerable number, but was not paid, and, in 1915, refused to renew the supply. A man between 50 and 60 ; fond of politics and intrigue, but rather obtuse. He has three or four sons, of whom one is often at Mecca with the Sherif. Joined pan-Arab movement, but continued for some time to draw a large subsidy from the Turks (£T.5,ooo ?). Nurses a bitter grudge against the Ottoman Government by reason of his having been invited to Damascus by Sami Pasha in 1911, and held there imprisoned. Captured the oasis of Jauf from Ibn Rashld in 1910, and fears the extension of the Hejaz Railway down W. Sirhan, a project under discussion in 1913. In June 1916, was reported to be in league with the Sherif of Mecca, and later (August) was further reported (incorrectly) to have gone to Mecca and taken command of reinforcements and guns for the force blockading Medina. The Sherif claims him as a firm friend. He is said to rule over 5,000 to 6,000 tents (like all Arab figures the number is probably exaggerated). (See also p. 106.) RASHID IBN SUMEIR. The principal chief of the Wuld 'Ali as a whole, and chief of six of its sub-tribes ('Ateifat, Mesalikh, Hammamld, Hajjaj, Tuluh, and Saqra—in all about 1,500 tents). His family has long held the chieftainship (e. g. in Burckhardt's time). SELIM ABU IRBE'A. Chief of the Thulam tribe of Sinai, ranging from Gaza to the101 Dead Sea. An intelligent, well-mannered Arab of real intiuence with his tribe, and paramount over its sub-tribes, which total some 2,000 souls, with, perhaps, 2,000 camels. TELAL IBN FA'IZ ABU MESHKUR. Paramount Chief of the Beni Sakhr. Claims to be able to call out 10,000 men (?). The pan-Arab party in Damascus claims him as an adherent. The Beni Sakhr are responsible for the Hajj line from Jizah to Kerak. Their southern pastures run down as far as the Jebel Tubeiq. They summer round Madeba and in the Gh5r. The Chief's father, Fa'iz, is still alive, but plays less part than the son in desert politics. The Fa'iz group owns about 500 tents, the whole of the B. Sakhr tribe having about 1,500. Telal refused to provide camels for the Turkish attack on the Canal in January *THE BEDOUIN TRIBES This section is designed to give an account of those tribal con stituents of present-day Arabian society which are essentially nomadic— those, in short, to which Arabs themselves concede the name Bedu. The Bedouin (Beddwi) type of society is the product of desert and steppe conditions, and cannot survive long under others. A tribe, which has left such conditions to settle in an oasis or other permanently arable land, does not necessarily cease to be a tribe, but it does cease to be a nomad or Bedouin tribe. The settled and half-settled tribes are therefore treated separately.- In the present section. Bedouin constituents of Arabian society which have passed wholly or in part northwards out of the peninsula are included. Not having changed the essential conditions of their life, but still ranging deserts and steppes, they have remained Bedu. It would be unsatisfactory, therefore, not to take account here of the nomad tribes of the Syrian Hamad and the Mesopotamian Jezirah. They are regarded by the peninsular Bedouins as forming one great social block with them selves, and some, e. g. certain constituents of the great Anazah group, still pass at regular seasons southward into the peninsula, while others have their own home ranges in the peninsula itself. Moreover, many, like the Ruweilah, Dhaflr, and Huweitat, move habitually from one side to the other of the border-line, and some, e. g. the Mesopotamian Shammar, though they stay to the north of it, are integral parts of larger tribal units still at home in the south. For convenience, we adopt a geographical division of Bedouin tribes into Northern, Central (Western and Eastern), and Southern. At the outset, a tree of tribal descent from the Arch-Patriarch, Abraham, will show what Arabs consider to be the true Bedouin stock. To know this pedigree is of practical value to any one who has to deal with Arab nomads, owing to the value which they themselves attach to genealogy, the social distinctions which they base upon it, and 'the estimation in which they hold those expert in its intricacies. Whoever doubts this, is forgetting the Old Testament and its insistence on descent.104 A. Northern Tribes i . The Anazah. The great group of the ANAZAH numerically probably the largest group of nomad Arab tribes, occupies the triangle of the Syrian Desert, the Hamad, which has its base on the Nefud, about lat. 30 0 , and its apex near Aleppo, about lat. 36°. On the east bank of the Euphrates the pasture lands N. of Deir ez-Zor and along the Khabur are also Anazah country : while a smaller group of kindred tribes is seated round Teima, between the Hejaz railway and the SW. borders of the Nefud. Ibn Sa'ud is said to come of the same stock (Hasanah). The Anazah belong to the people of the North, Ahl esh-Shimal. Historians give their descent from 'Anazah, son of Asad, who sprang from Rabi'ah, one of the two great branches of Nizar. The modern Anazah tribesman will always claim descent from Wa'il, who belonged to a younger branch of the Asad group, and relate that it is his son 'Anz or 'Anaz who is the eponymous founder of the tribe. They are not, however, united under one head, but are divided into several large sections which maintain towards one another an attitude generally friendly, though it does not exclude marauding expeditions and private feuds among the smaller Sheikhs. The hereditary foes of the Anazah are the Shammar; indeed, the history of nomad Arabia is dominated for the last 150 years by the rivalry between these two. The original seat of the Shammar seems to have been to the N. of the Wadi er-Rummah, on the pilgrim road from Basra to Medina, or even farther south towards Yemen. One of those mysterious impulses which, from the beginning of historic times, have set the inhabitants of the penin sula migrating northwards—influences which may spring from an almost imperceptible change in climatic conditions coupled with slow increase of population in a land incapable of supporting more than very small numbers—began to disturb the Anazah in the second half of the eighteenth century. They followed on the heels of the Shammar into the Syrian Desert. The Fed'an and the Hasanah pushed the Shammar before them across the Euphrates, and established themselves in the northern steppes, which are less arid, enjoying a greater rainfall, than the wastes of central Arabia. The 'Amarat, Siba', and Wuld 'Ali seem to have come next, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the Ruweilah. Their herds have flourished and increased in a climate more beneficent than that which they had left. The most famous stocks of horses are found among the northern Anazah, and the greatest numbers of camels. Bedu of the purest blood and tradition, they have remained entirely beyond the control of the Ottoman Government ; and except for a few palm-gardens on the Lower Euphrates, a little cultivation on the Khabur, and a village near Damascus, their Sheikhs have given no pledge to estab lished order by the acquisition of settled lands, nor is any part of the Syrian Desert ploughed or harvested. Their geographical position gives105 them command over some of the main trade-routes of 'lurkish Arabia. The Hamad is a bridge rather than a barrier between Syria and Meso potamia. Until 1911, the camel post from Damascus to Baghdad passed over it once a fortnight, and regularly during the winter and spring the agents of the Damascene sheep merchants cross it, paying dues to the Anazah for safe conduct, while the camel herds of the latter supply the markets both of Syria and of Egypt ; indeed, it is not too much to say that the greater part of the camel trade is in their hands. Moreover, the road down the Euphrates from Aleppo to Baghdad is largel\ at their mercy, as well as the first half of a frequented carriage road from Deir, via the Sinjar, to Mosul. The Anazah are thus the first of the great indepen dent tribes with whom administrators of the settled lands must come into contact, and upon their goodwill depends freedom of intercourse between Syria and Mesopotamia. Last century they played a large part in Syrian politics, and have still a zest for the game. Their own depen dence on the Syrian markets must always make it a matter of the first importance to them to maintain friendly terms with those who control the province commercially ; but it must be remembered that commercial control of Syria is not, and never has been, in the hands of the Turks. The western side of the Syrian Desert is occupied by the R uweilah (Ruwalla). With their powerful confederates the Wuld 'Ali and the Muhallaf, who are in the closest relations with them, and also their allies, the Hasanah, they number about 7,000 tents. They wander over the desert from Homs and Hamah in the north, where the Hasanah have their summer pasturages and are beginning to settle down as cultivators, to Qasr el-Azraq, south of Jebel Duruz (where the Ruweilah dira touches that of their foes, the Beni Sakhr) and down the Wadi Sirhan to the oasis of Jauf el-'Amr, which the Ruweilah took from Ibn Rashid some fi\e years ago. In summer they occupy the pasture grounds S. of Damascus and push as far west as the Jaulan. To the east the limits of the Ruweilah do not extend far beyond Jebel 'Amud and the sources of the Wadi Hauran. The loose confederation of tribes, of which the W uld 'A li are composed, holds the steppe east and south-east of Damascus and along the first part of the old post-road to Baghdad. Ibn Sumeir owns the village of 'Ain Dhikr at Tell el-Faras, some 12 hours from Damascus, with the cultivation round it. A detached group round Teima, the F uqara and the B. W ahab, are also to be reckoned among the sub- tribes of the Wuld 'Ali, but they have no political connexion with them, and fall under the authority of Ibn Rashid whenever he is strong enough to exercise it. The l^uqara are a small pool tiibe, with fc\\ camels, which depends for its livelihood partly on the payment it receives from the Ottoman Government for protecting the Hejaz railway fiom Dar el-Hamra to Meda'in Salih, and partly on a little cultivated land which it possesses in the rocky Harrah of Kheibar. Ihe Billi and the Huweitat, a. o106 with their close allies the B. 'Atiyah, are their enemies. The Aida, who are the Sheikhly clan of the southern Wuld 'Ali, have charge of a section of the Hejaz railway south of Meda'in Salih. In summer the Ruweilah draw into the Wadi Sirhan or go with the Wuld 'Ali towards the fertile Matkh plain, watered by the Barrada; but the volcanic Harrahs east of Jebel Duruz are inhabited by tribes hostile to the Anazah, the Serdiyah, a branch of the Beni Sakhr, and the Jebeliyah, composed of Ghiyadh, Beni Hasan, Masa'id, and others, all allied with the Druzes. With these and with the Druzes themselves the Anazah have always been at enmity. The paramount chief of the Ruweilah is of the house of Sha'lan and the sub-tribe of Mur'idh. The present representative is Nuri esh- Sha'lan. His own sub-tribe, the Sha'lan, together with the Nuseir, who come directly under him, consists of about 1,000 tents, but over all the Ruweilah he is unquestioned autocrat, and his authority is recog nized by the Wuld 'Ali and the Muhallaf. He is probably the most powerful of all purely nomad chiefs, and, since his capture of Jauf, has shown himself a successful rival of the Shammar. His son, Nawwaf, a convinced adherent of the pan-Arab party, is his representative at Jauf. Though more colourless than his father, he is better educated and is considered by the Arab Unionist party in Damascus, among whom he is well known, to be the most advanced political thinker in the desert. He has the inherited interest in the Turkish question which those of his house can scarcely escape, since it touches their own future so closely. Nuri himself bears a bitter grudge against the Ottoman Government by reason of his having been invited to Damascus by Sami Pasha in 1911, and there held a prisoner for almost a year. The grievance was aggra vated by the fact that he had previously offered his assistance to Sami Pasha for the subjugation of the Druzes. He dreads any extension of Turkish authority towards the desert, and strongly opposed a scheme set on foot in 1913 to carry a branch of the Hejaz railway from Jizah to Qasr el-Azraq, and thence down the W. Sirhan to Kaf. In 1914 he refused to collect camels for the Ottoman Government, who were in need of transport animals for the Egyptian campaign, thereby greatly enhancing their difficulties. He removed his people into their eastern pasturages, where the Turks had no hold over them, and he is said to have acted similarly a year later and, in 1916, to have joined the Sherif of Mecca. E. of the Ruweilah and the Wuld 'Ali, the Syrian Desert up to the Euphrates is held by the 'Amarat and by the two great subdivisions of the Bishr, the Fed'an and the Siba' (Sba), who claim descent from various mythical heroes of whom Wa'il was the progenitor. The 'Amarat country is the SE. corner of the Syrian Desert bordering on the Euphrates from Kerbela to above Hit. The tribesmen touch the N. edge of the Nefud and go down SE. into Shammar territory if pasturage is lacking else where, maintaining a truce with the Sheikhs of that dira. The early spring finds them in a wide depression, the Qa'rah (Ga'rah), two days' journey107 W. of Hit, while in summer they come back to the Euphrates or cluster about the springs in the Hauran valley, round Mat. The Fed'an range from Aleppo to Deir on both sides of the Euphrates and up the Khabur valley almost to the Sinjar. The Siba ', famous breeders of camels, are seated on the middle sections of the Palmyra road. They go up towards Homs and Hamah on the west, to Resafah on the east, and north almost to Aleppo. If pasture is lacking on the Syrian side of the desert, they seek it in the Fed'an country and in winter their Sheikhs come down, with those of the 'Amarat and the I'ed an, to Mat and the Wadi Sirhan. The 'Amarat also cross the Euphrates on occasion, and camp with the Fed'an along the Khabur. The Wuld Suleiman, who roam between Teima and the Nefud, are of Fed'an lineage and a part of Bishr, but they stand politically outside the confederacy ; for, like their allies and neighbours the Fuqara, they pay tribute to Ibn Rashid. They have not many camels, but own a few patches of palm-growing lands in the Kheibar Harrah, which are cultivated, on their behalf, by the Huteim. The paramount chief of the ' Amarat is of the house of Hadhdhal, Fahd Bey being the present sheikh. His tents number about 3,000. He is wealthy, and owns palm-gardens at Ghazazah neai Keibela, at Bagh- dadiyah above Hit, and elsewhere on the Euphrates. Although his wisdom and skill in tribal diplomacy is much vaunted, he is now an old man and not so active as Nuri of the Ruweilah ; nor does he concern himself with external politics. He has suffered imprisonment at the hand of the Turks, and cordially dislikes them, but his closest link with affairs outside the desert is his landed property on the Euphrates. He fears that if the Hindiyah escape, a part of Sir W. W illcocks s scheme of Mesopotamian irrigation, were to be put into execution, his gardens at Ghazazah might be partly submerged, and he was inclined to blame the English for their share in that project. He could only with difficulty be reassured on this head, and shown that the better distribution of the water would be of benefit to himself in common with all other landowners. A more striking personality is Hakim (Hachim) ibn Muheid, who, with Hakim ibn Qeishish, rules over the Fed'an , some 3,500 tents in all. Ibn Muheid is possibly second only to Nuri esh-Sha'lan in the Anazah federa tion. He is a man of about 40, vain, money-loving, and strongly pan-Arab. His position on the middle reaches of the Euphrates enables him to close the riverain road to traffic whenever he pleases. Until the Baghdad railway is completed, this road is the customary, and by far the shortest, means of communication between Aleppo and Baghdad, and is now connected with Constantinople by a railway, broken only b\ a shoit interruption on the Taurus. The Siba ' are less numerous, some 1,800 tents all told ; their ruling families are the Beni Murshid and the Beni Hudeib (Hadeib). Upon all the Anazah the Ottoman Government levies, so far as it is able, a sheep-tax and a camel-tax. The great sheikhs receive o 2108 Ottoman subsidies, paid with something less than regularity. The sums are not large. A man like Nuri may be given about £20 a month, paid to his agent in Damascus, who uses the money for the purchase of neces sary supplies which he sends out to his chief in the desert. The Ruweilah, who raise no crops, are entirely dependent on Damascus for provisions. The paramount Anazah sheikhs, Ibn Sha'lan, Ibn Hadhdhal, Ibn Sumeir, and Ibn Muheid, could each of them put into the field from 1,500 to 2,000 men, armed and mounted on camels, with a small proportion of horses. The Siba' sheikhs could muster another 1,000. The united Anazah forces would therefore number about 9,000 men, if it were con ceivable that they could ever be gathered together at the same time— an exceedingly improbable contingency in regions where there are no adequate means of communication, and none but a loose tribal organiza tion. Nor are the conditions of pasturage and water-supply, prevailing in the Hamad, suitable to large concentrations of men and animals. The total number of camels among the Ruweilah, 'Amarat, Fed'an, and Siba' must be greater than in any other part of Arabia. They cannot, all told, be reckoned at much less than an average of 50 to a tent. The Wuld 'Ali are not so well supplied, but they may own about 20 to a tent. At this estimate the camel-herds of the northern Anazah would touch a very large figure—some 600,000 animals.Ill i,800 tents Tribe, SIBA 4 Sub-Tribe.

They say that Thamir, jidd of the Duleim, and his brother Jabbar, jidd of the Jubur, guided by a man of the Sulubba, occupied the wells of Muheiwir in the Wadi They wander over the desert on either side of the Euphrates fiom Fellujah almost to Anah, sharing the Eastern Shamiyah, the Syrian desert, with the 'Amarat, with whom they are in close alliance. Ihey have cultivated ground in the Euphrates valley, and rear large flocks of sheep which supply the Damascus market. Every winter the dealers come out across the Hamad, and, staying each with his own Sheikh, purchase the season's lambs, and drive them home across the grassy steppe in the spring. The Duleim are not camel-breeders ; their supply is little more than sufficient for their own needs. The Shammar of the Jezirah are their enemies, and there is constant feud between them and the Shiah tribes of Traq, such as the Beni Hasan, who pasture their sheep in the desert round Kerbela. They are noted thieves, and have always given trouble on the Euphrates highroad, where they hold up every unprotected caravan. In 1910 Nazim Pasha repressed them with a stern hand, and during his brief administration at Baghdad, travellers and merchantb journeyed in security. 'Ali Suleiman, the paramount Sheikh of the Duleim, was on terms of friendship with Jemal Pasha, who succeeded Nazim, and he has continued to court the favour of the Ottoman Govern ment. He owns a house and palm gardens at Rumadi, and can, therefore, be coerced into good behaviour. He is not a man of much intelligence, and prefers, to any active share in politics, a quiet life and the peaceful enjoyment of the position left him by his father, Suleiman esh-Sharqi, who was a commanding figure in the 'Iraq. Ibn Qu'ad camps mostly on the east bank of the Euphrates. Hauran.112 Duleim Tribe. Sheikhs. Sub-Tribes. 3,000 tents. 'Ali Suleiman esh-Sharqi. Mahdmidah. Ibn Qu ad. Abu &lt;j sa Qureit. Abu Alwdn.

Ihe JEBELlYAH are a loose confederation of independent tribes acknowledging no common Sheikh, but united by common interests and conditions. They are known either as the Jebeliyah or by the older name of Zobeid (Zubeid). They inhabit the volcanic districts to east and south of the Jebel Hauran and the Leja between the Hauran hills and Damascus. They own a little cultivated land, mainly in the Ruhbah, and flocks of sheep, but few camels. They are, as a whole, poor and of bad reputation * like all tribes on the frontier of the desert they rob and pillage their neighbours, the settled inhabitants, but they usually escape unpunished ; for the Sultan s writ fails a few miles out of Damascus, and the stony camping grounds of the Jebeliyah are difficult of approach. The Ghiyadh used to plunder the desert post when it travelled fort- nightly across the desert to Baghdad. Since its cessation, in 1912, they have occupied the outlying Turkish station, the qishlah east of Dhumeir, which was abandoned by the gendarmerie. The Jebeliyah are close allies of the Druzes, of whom they stand in awe. They pasture the Druze flocks in the low-lying Safah during the winter, and in summer come up into the foothills of the Jebel Hauran. They are usually on bad terms with the Anazah, and steal the sheep and camels of the Wuld 'Ali and Hasanah whenever an opportunity offers ; and they are always at feud with the Bem Sakhr, who are the foes of the Druze. 1 he Masa'Id are said to be the most numerous of the Jebeliyah tribes * the Ghiyadh are next in importance. The Is a, though they range Jebel Duruz and are classed vulgarly as Zobeid, are of Sakhr stock and acknowledge the kinship. The tribes of Jebel Duruz and the Leja are only a part of the Zobeid. Another large group is found east of the Tigris and is Shiah. The Aqeidat, Duleim, and Jubur all claim Zobeid origin. All Zobeid tribes claim a common Qahtan ancestor and therefore are Ahl Qibli.

The BENI SAKHR, usually known as Ahl esh-Shimal,' People of the North', are of the northern Arabian stock, and reckon their descent from Mudhar, either through 'Abs or through Tamim. Legend gives varied accounts of their origin, one being that the eponymous founder of the tribe was a certain Sakhr who came from the east ; another that their ancestor was a child abandoned in the desert; he was adopted by a Bedouin called Dahamsh, who gave him his daughter in marriage, and was nick named Toweiq (Tuweiq) on account of a small ring which he wore round his neck ; for this reason the whole tribe is sometimes known as the Tauqah. It is also occasionally named, after the foster-father of its founder, the Dahamshah. All traditions agree, however, that the Beni Sakhr spring from a common ancestor whose tomb is venerated at Bir Ba'ir. This cenotaph, built in an ancient caravan-station on the road from Damascus to Teima, which fell into disuse in the early Abbasid period, is covered with small votive offerings, and the great Sheikhs of the tribe, when they move down to summer quarters here, would not venture to enter the Wadi Ba'ir without sacrificing a camel in honour of the pdd. The sub-tribes of the Sukhur are all descendants of Toweiq, the genea logical tree being as follows : Toweiq. Ghufl. Sehim. Ghubein. Qa'ud. 'Amr. Heqeish. Hamid. Muteirat. Fa iz. I Zeben. The territory of the Beni Sakhr stretches from the Jebel Duruz in the north to the depression of Jafar, near Ma'an, in the south; it is bounded on the east by the Wadi Sirhan, and on the west by the Jordan. It is a rolling country, sparsely covered with grass, and intersected by deep valleys which are rich in vegetation. In the spring the Sukhur go down as far south as the Jebel Tubeiq, when they are on good terms with the Huweitat ; but relations between the two tribes are usually somewhat strained, and more than one pitched battle has been fought in the rocky Tubeiq hills. In the summer the wells of Ba ir gi\ e abundant water, and the deep valley is never bare of pasturage ; but the greater part of the tribe withdraws to the country round Madeba and the northern Belqa, though the gradual extension of cultivation along the line of the Hejaz Railway has restricted their pasture grounds. Some of the Fa'iz sub-tribe hold cultivated lands round Jizah, and Fawwaz, eldest son of the paramount Sheikh Tela! ibn Fa'iz, has built himself a house on the ruins of the Roman fortress of Qastal. The completion of the Hejaz Railway has undoubtedly strengthened the hold of the Ottoman Government upon the independent tribes who114 range along its northern sections. The Snkhur, for example, do not enjoy the full measure of their former autonomy ; for though they are unassailable when they retire into the desert, retribution falls upon them when the summer droughts force them back into the pastures west of the railway, and their cornfields at Jizah, Duleilah, Netel, and elsewhere along the line enable the 1 urks to put a further turn on the screw. Fawwaz has become an Ottoman official, being Kaimmakam of Jizah; but he is too close to Damascus to have escaped the political movement which has its centre in the capital of Syria, and Arab Unionists speak of him as a firm adherent of the Nationalist party. He is about 35, fairly intelligent, energetic, secretive, and untrustworthy. The Sukhur are responsible for the Hejaz Railway, as they used to be respon sible for the Pilgrim Road; they guard the line from Jizah to Kerak, and receive a yearly subsidy in return for their services. Jaussen reckons the united strength of the tribe at from 700 to 800 tents, including in this estimate the three principal tribal divisions, the A ghbein, the G hufl (with the two big sub-tribes, the Z eben and the H eqeish), and the K hadh I r. T o these, however, must be added the K hurshan and the J ubur, originally constituents of the K a'abnah, a tribe once powerful, but now almost non-existent as a tribal unit. The Khurshan, formerly known as the Hammad, under their Sheikh Hadithah, are politically inseparable from the Beni Sakhr, though a wholly different tribe-mark bears witness to their different origin. They are a warlike people, biecdeis of horses and camels ; their pasture grounds are near the Jebel Hauran. I he Jubur are sheep owners, and only half-nomadic. Ihe S aleitah, with a total of about 100 tents, are clients of the Sukhur and live among them. The J ahawashah, though they are reckoned as a clan of the Fa'iz, are not of Beni Sakhr stock. They are a fraction of the U seidah, who, after a bloody quarrel, abandoned the Belqa, and took refuge with the Fa'iz. They do not intermarry with the Sukhur, though in all other respects they form part of the tribe. On the other hand, the small but valiant tribe of the S erdiyah, an offshoot of the Sukhur, are politically independent of the latter, and not infrequently at feud with them. They inhabit the eastern edge of the volcanic country to the east of the Jebel Hauran, and owe their position in the desert to the reputation of their late paramount Sheikh, Mit ab el-Qanj, said to have been the strongest of living men. His son Ghalib, the present Sheikh, is about 30, not so noted a raider as Mit ab, less ambitious than his father, and of mediocre intelligence. He is in close touch with Damascus, and counted by the younger Nationalist politicians as a friend and ally; but he is not sufficiently powerful to dispense with any protection which he can obtain from the Ottoman Government, and in 1911 he successfully invoked the aid of Sami Pasha against his hereditary foes, the Ruweilah. 1 he Bern Sakhr are almost always at war with the Anazah con- 1 Coutumes des Arabes au Pays de Moab, p. 400.115 federation on their east frontier ; with the Huweitat their relations are doubtful, with a general tendency to hostility, and the same applies to their north-western neighbours, the 'Adwan. The Druzes to the north are their sworn enemies, and the Zobeid confederation (the Jebeliyah), who roam the slopes of the Jebel Hauran, usually throw in their lot with the Druzes against the Sukhur, though they are on fairly good terms with the Serdiyah. The cultivators from Madeba and Salt, mainly Christians, who own most of the ploughed lands on the Hejaz Railway, are obliged to maintain friendly relations with the Beni Sakhr, since the Ottoman Government offers them little or no protection. They keep open house for the tribesmen, who profit largely by their hospitality, and hold them in commensurate esteem. Such families as the Ibn Jabir and the Bisharra are much respected, and enjoy a considerable influence in the desert. The cultivated land does not extend far beyond the railway, east of which the soil is too thin and the rainfall too scanty for successful corn-growing. The latest information is, that after the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey in the winter of 1914, when the attack on the Canal was developing, the Beni Sakhr, fearing that the Ottoman Government would seize their camels for transport purposes, withdrew across the Sirhan. Having been for the past year at peace with the Ruweilah, they took refuge in their country. They were last heard of between 'Amud and Mat, in the Wadyan district, and had even pushed as far east as the 'Amarat pastures. The Sukhur are not among the great camel-owning tribes, but their herds can scarcely amount to less than some 12,000 to 15,000 head. 5. The Humeidah. The dira of the HUMEIDAH lies round Dhiban. It is bounded on the south-west by Khirbat es-Sarfa and the Wadi Beni Hammad; on the west by the Dead Sea ; on the north by the Zerqa valley, Mareijimah and Duleilah, and on the east by Umm Shureif, 'Ara'ir, and the Wadi Mojib. It extends, therefore, from 7 miles north of Kerak to 4 miles south of Madeba, a distance of about 28 miles, and is about 17 miles from west to east. The tribe, which had an evil reputation for unruliness and violence, has, since the occupation of Kerak by the Ottoman Government some twenty years ago, been reduced to complete submission and almost ruined by exactions. It pays ^3,000 in taxes. The Mudir of Walah was specially appointed to take charge of the Humeidah. 1 hey number about 700 tents, and claim descent from a common ancestor called Fadhil, who came into the Dead Sea region with Sakhr, the jidd of the Sukhur. For this reason they recognize a distant kinship between them selves and the Beni Sakhr. They are sheep-breeders, and grow crops in the fertile Kurah district. Some of the Beni Tarif are to be found at p 2117 Kerak, and there are about 30 houses of Humeidah at Buseirah, east of Tafilah, under Sheikh Salim ibn Masyughah. Tribe.

Tribes of the Central West 1. The Huweitdt. The HUWEITAT are a stout and warlike tribe whose country extends from near Teima in the south to Kerak in the north, and on the east to the Nefud and the Wadi Sirhan. On the west it is scattered down the Gulf of Akaba and Midian coast, and through Sinai into Egypt. Huweitat are nomads in the desert north-east of Cairo, and settled as culti vators round Tanta. The Huweitat of Akaba, Sinai, and Egypt have no political link with the Sheikhs whose head-quarters are at or near Ma'an; but they recognize certain claims of kinship, and if a Huweiti of the Tawayah or Beni Jazi got into difficulties with the Ottoman Govern ment, he would seek refuge, if he could escape, in Sinai or in Egypt. The Huweitat have, however, an exceptionally bad name for treachery. They are divided among themselves, and do not respect their own blood- ties. One clan will set upon a caravan under the convoy of a rafiq of another clan, shoot the raflq, and rob and murder the merchants. On the Syrian side the leading sub-tribe is the Beni Jazi, and 'Arar ibn Jazi is nominally the paramount Sheikh ; but he is not recognized by the Abu Tayy, and the two groups are frequently at feud. The layy are an off-shoot of the Jazi, and owe their position to the restless energy of their Sheikhs. The late chief, 'Audah, was one of the most famous raiders of his time, and did not hesitate to carry his expeditions across the Hamad to the Euphrates, where he raided Ibn Hadhdhal of the118 Amarat. On one occasion, when he was out against the Siba', he pushed almost as far north as Aleppo. The Huweitat are on close terms of friendship with the Beni 'Atiyah, and are at liberty to camp through all the 'Atiyah country. The Sheikh Ahmed ibn Tuqeiqah occupies the Red Sea coast between Muweilah and Dhaba, with his head-quarters at Dhaba. They are at war with the Shammar, except the clan of the Rammal, which is connected by marriage with the 1 ayy ; and they are usually on bad terms with the Wuld Sulei man and the Luqara. With the Sukhur relations are always delicate, and the two tribes often break into sharp conflict. In 1914 the jealousy between Ibn Jazi and Abu Tayy led to continuous raids between the sub- tribes. Ibn Jazi took refuge with the Sukhur, and the Tayy with the Ruweilah. But the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey filled the tribes with a common fear that their camels might be requisi tioned by the Ottoman Government for transport purposes ; the Huweitat made up their differences, and together with the Sukhur retired east into the Anazah dira, where the Government could not reach them. They are charged with the protection of the Hejaz Railway from Kerak to Ma'an, and receive a yearly subsidy. Since Sami Pasha's expedition into the desert in 1910, they have regarded Ottoman authority with a certain amount of respect. ' Audah's cousin, Mohammed abu Tayy, was imprisoned for several months in Damascus, and upon his release was made responsible for the payment of the sheep- and camel-tax of his tribe—a lucrative position which he would be unwilling to forfeit. In the spring, the I ayy pasture over the north and east of the Jebel I ubeiq ; the Jazi camp to the south and south-west. In the summer the tribe draws in to Ma'an, where it owns a little cultivation, and to Jafar, a depression east of Ma'an. Ma'an is the northern limit of the sandstone desert. Here the grassy downs of the Beni Sakhr country give place to forbidding leagues of rock weathered into fantastic shapes and diversified by sand-hills. Wells are few ; nevertheless, in the sandstone bottoms there is a sufficiency of small shrubs and succulent weeds after the scanty rain. The Huweitat are not among the great camel-owners ; probably the whole of the Syrian branch has not more than 5 ,000 to 8,000 animals. The Huweitat claim to be Ashraf, i. e. descendants of the prophet through his daughter tatimah; but it has been conjectured that they have a history which is ethnologically of far greater interest. They may be the descendants of the Nabataeans, who held the caravan road to Yemen— the old spice road—and had their capital at Petra, a few hours west of Ma'an. Tribe. Suh-Trihe. Sheikh.

Beni 'Attyah. The BENI 'ATIYAH are an old tribe closely akin to the Anazah. They claim descent from Ma'z, who is said to have been brother of 'Anz, the ancestor of the Anazah. A part of the tribe in the Hisma plain, east of Akaba, is known as the Ma'zi. Some authorities state that the 'Allyah tribe was the origin of the Huweitat, the Heiwat, the Terabin, Ma'zi, and Tiyahah. Whether or no this be the true explanation of the relation between the 'Atiyah and the Huweitat, it is certain that their connexion is exceedingly close. The two tribes camp in each other's country, and aid each other against common enemies. The 'Atiyah occupy the northern half of the 'Aweiridh Harrah, and are separated from the Mawahib Harrah by the hollow plain of the Jau, through which there is a road from Wejh to Tebuk. The Jau is reckoned to be the dividing line between the Ahl esh-Shamal and the Ahl Qibli, the northern and the southern Arabs. The 'Atiyah are held responsible for the Hejaz line from Ma'an to Dar el-Hamra. The coast from Sheikh 'Antar up to the Gulf of Akaba is in their hands (or those of the Huweitat, their allies), as well as the high barren hills between the Harrah and the sea. 1 heir rugged mountain district is unsuitable for camel-breeding. Of the sub-tribes, the SidenyIn and the Khutheirah inhabit the 'Aweiridh Harrah, the SidenyIn being at the northern end with the Subut to the west of them. The ' Uqeilat (Ageylat) used to be carriers of goods between Ma'an and Tebuk, but the railway must have taken some of their trade. Ihe 'Atiyah are stout in arms. Their foes are the Shammar and the allies of Shammar, the Fuqara and Wuld Suleiman. With the Fuqara, the 'Atiyah maintain an inextinguishable feud. They raid the Harb and the central clans of the Huteim. Tribe. Sub-Tribe. B eni ' A tiyah. Robildt. Mohammed ibn 'Atiyah. 'Uqeildt. SidenyIn. Khutheirah. Subiit. 3, 4, 5. The Billi, Mawdhib, and Juheinah. The plain of the Jau running through the 'Aweiridh Harrah is counted the frontier between the Ahl esh-Shimal and the Ahl Qibli. To the north lie the B. Atiyah ; to the south the Mawahib, who, though they are of Anazah descent, being a tribe of the Siba', are Billi by adoption. The Billi and their southern neighbours, the Juheinah, are both of the Himyar stock, and therefore rightly described as Ahl Qibli. The MAWAHIB (Moahib) inhabit the southern part of the 'Aweiridh, a rugged mass of volcanic rock upon a platform of sandstone. They are sheep-breeders, and are reduced to small numbers, though they were once powerful enough to drive the Beni Sakhr from the 'Aweiridh. Scattered clans are to be found among their kinsmen, the Siba , and with the Beni Sakhr in the Belqa. There is besides an ancient colony of Mawahib husbandmen, keepers of cattle, in124 ('AMOR), the 'AUF, and the ZOBEID, of all which are ranked by some other authorities as independent sections. While, therefore, the BEN1 SALIM, with its principal sub-sections, can be set out systematically with fair assurance, the scheme of all the rest, as given below, must be under stood to be provisional, and, in any case, not complete as regards sub sections. Of these latter only those are given about whose existence and connexion with larger sections two or three good authorities agree. The Hejaz Harb include all the BENI SALIM and also the 'AUF and ZOBEID sub-sections of the MASRUH. These are cultivators, fishermen, and carriers for the greater part, but contain also many nomads, e. g. the bulk of the SUBH sub-section of the BENI SALIM and several 'AUF clans, notorious for their predatory instincts and life. The ZOBEID, as a whole, are settled along the coast from near Yambo' down to Serum, their centre being at Rabugh, and there is also an Asiri section south of Lith. The Harb of NW. Nejd are mainly the BENI 'AMR whose principal sheikhs live outside Hejaz. They own, however, most of the date gardens east of Medina; one of the sub-sections, the Beni 'Ali (a turbulent lot of Shiahs), cultivates those nearest to Qubbah in the 'Awali plains.

The ATEIBAH ('Uteibah) are the most powerful tribe in Central Arabia, strong in arms and great camel-breeders. Among all the nomads they are second in importance only to the Anazah. They occupy the eastern side of the Hejaz with the volcanic harrahs between the Hajj road and the Central Arabian Steppes. Their pasturages run east to Qasim and Woshm, and south to the diras of the Qahtan,of the Buqum and Shalawah, and of the Sebei'. This country abounds in wells; it has a regular if small rainfall in winter, and is not wholly dry in early autumn, when it receives the end of the monsoon rains. It supports large herds of sheep and camels, and in places the grass grows so richly that the Bedouins gather a hay-crop ; everywhere there is a low growth of acacias, and game is plentiful. The clans in the Hejaz, such as the Helissah, Meraukhah, Kurzan, Sebbahah, Marashidah, and Semarrah, are small in numbers and breed sheep only, ihere is a little cultivation in the harrahs, no moie than palm-groves and small Ateibah villages.126 The two chief sections of the tribe are the Ruqah and the Berqah. The Ruqah are chiefly in the Hejaz, the Berqah in the eastern desert. But there are also three less important sections, ranging in the west and south of the Ateibah country. The tribe has no one Paramount Chief. Its sub-sections are not well known, and the scheme below must be re garded as provisional and, probably, incomplete. The whole tribe acknow ledges now the authority of the Emir of Mecca ; but Ibn Sa'ud of Riyadh puts in from time to time a claim to the allegiance of the Berqah section, which used to acknowledge him, more or less. He has not forgiven them for harbouring the rebel Aulad Sa'ud in 1911 and, unless restrained by agreement with or fear of, the Emir of Mecca, he is always apt to raid them, as he did in 1911 and 1912. They, for their part, sometimes raid into his province of Woshm, and interfere with Qasim. The control of them and the right of taxing them form the chief bone of contention between Riyadh and Mecca. The whole tribe is now well armed, and it supplied about 18,000 men to the Meccan army in 1916 ; the difficulty of making these and Harb tribesmen work together proved serious. The Ateibah are foes of the Harb, than whom they are more powerful; they are generally on good terms with the two small tribes on their southern frontier, the Buqum and Shalawah, and at feud with the Qahtan.

Minor Tribes of Southern Hejaz. Several small independent tribes share the south part of Hejaz with the two greater tribes, Harb and Ateibah, of which the first lies along the coast, the second inland from Ta'if. They are all, in part, settled or half- settled, and almost all acknowledge the authority of the Sherif. [a) The HUDHEIL (Hatheil) are divided into two main sections, a northerly and a southerly. The first ranges east and south of Mecca, and especially along the road between that city and Ta'if, the second beyond Ta'if. No. I is said to have seven clans: Mutarafah (Wadi Fatimah), Mas'ud (Ri' es-Seil), Sowahar (Ri' es-Seil), B. 'Amr, Met'an (from Mecca to Jiddah), Lahiyan (east of Mecca), Janabir (El-Kor). No. II has eight clans: Garhlyah, Marzuqlyah, Sarwani, Kabkabi, B. Fahm, Nadwiyah, Dadiyah, and 'Abdiyah. [h) BENI FAHAM, a small tribe living in Wadi Waghar, to the east of the Juhadlah and between them and the Beni Thaqlf. They are entirely nomadic and are noted for their skill in tracking. They are friendly with the Beni Thaqif and Juhadlah, and are still faithful to Sherif 'Ali, the deposed Emir of Mecca. The Chief Sheikh is Isma/il ibn Dahyan. They number about 1,000 men. Related to the Qoreish. (c) The JUHADLAH [Juhadlah) are an entirely nomad tribe with no defined limits, but such boundaries as they have may be said to start just south of Serum (Serom), the southern limit of the Harb, and run thence almost to Lith, covering all the coast and taking a wide sweep inland to the east of Jebel Abu Shauk and Jebel Sa'dlyah. Their neighbours on the south are the Al Mahdi and Dhawi Barakat, and, to the north-east of Lith, the Beni Faham. They also mingle with the Dhawi Surur and Shenabrah to the south128 of Mecca, and are generally to be found along the road from Mecca to Jebel 'Arafat and east to Shedad and Jebel Mohram. From Serum to Lith, however, is their original district, the chief centre being round Sa'dlyah. They number about 4,000 men, and although good fighters are not quarrelsome. Their country is a poor one, and affords scanty pasturage to their herds of camels, in which they are fairly rich. In times of drought they go south to Wadi Dokhah in the Dhawi Barakat country. They do not cultivate, but buy all their grain from Ta'if or Lith, in return for the semn which they sell. They all carry spears and knives and, those who can afford them, rifles. For purposes of internal administration the tribe is divided into two parts, the one under Mohammed ibn Sa'id, the other under Mohammed ibn Hanesh. The former is faithful to the Sherif of Mecca. Sheikh Mohammed ibn Hanash, who rules over the Al Munif or Muniflyah, dislikes the Sherif, owing to his habit of commandeering camels whenever his followers go to Mecca, and therefore keeps chiefly to Sa'dlyah and the coast. He has made overtures to Idrisi, but is too far off and too weak to do more than sympathize with him. He was neutral during the Turco-Sherifian expedition in 1910, and removed his tribe into the inaccessible mountains. ihe two chief Sheikhs are on good terms with each other and the sub-tribes freely intermingle. They are friendly towards the Dhawi Hasan and Beni Faham, but inimical to the Harb. The Ateibah, though distant, raid them when they stray too far east. The Hudheil and they are of one origin and are on terms of the closest friendship. 1 he Juhadlah are hospitable to strangers, but they have little religion and seldom go on the pilgrimage. In person they are taller than most Arabs, wear their hair short, and are dressed in a red ' tob' (thuh) which reaches from the waist to the knee, the end being thrown over the left shoulder. (i) Chief Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Sa'id. Sub-'l ribes : 'Alyaniyah, Sheinlyah, Hershiyah, Jamshiyah, Tha'baniyah, Hasnaniyah, Jirshiyah. (ii) Chief Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Hanash. (1) Al Munlf, of which the chief subdivisions are : {d) The AL MAHDI are a small semi-nomad tribe near Lith, who make their living chiefly as fishermen. They are a poor and down-trodden people, thoroughly awed by their powerful neighbours the Dhawi Hasan. They do not number more than 200 souls. Al es- Sihim Al Madathir Beni Bur Al Yam Al Zahein Mohammed es-Sultan Husein ibn Huneish Mas'ud ibn Mohammed Mohammed ibn Muhsin Mizhar ibn Sihman (2) Hijrlyah, of which the chief subdivision is : Al Faham Haidar ibn Huneish129 Chief Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Qasim. Chief Clans. Mujeishah Ahmed ibn Mas'udah Al Hasan Ibn Ahmed er-Rideini [e) The BENI MALIK of the Hejaz are a small tribe, numbering not more than 2,000 men, who live in the mountains inland of Lith. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Sa'd on the north, the Shalawah nomads on the east, the Zahran on the south, and the Juhadlah on the west. The Beni Malik are not a fighting tribe, but they are hospitable and industrious, and cultivate figs and grapes in the wadis as well as wheat, barley, and dhura. During the pilgrimage season most of them go to Mecca and Jiddah and act as porters. They thus come more into contact with the outside world than most tribes and are more civilized. They are devoted to the Sherif and pay him taxes. Nasir ibn Rawwaf is their chief Sheikh. They live at peace with their neighbours, except the Shalawah, who occasionally raid them. Most of their villages are clustered in Wadi Luz and Wadi Rumman. (/) The SHENABRAH are a small nomad tribe to the south of Mecca, numbering not more than 150 men. They are one of the twenty- one Ashraf clans (see pp. 157 ff.), and, being nearly related to the 'Abadilah, used to support the Sherif of Mecca, but are now reported disaffected. Sherif Judallah is their head. The Shenabrah are brave and lawless, and are generally at loggerheads with the Dhawi Surur. (g) The DHAWI SURUR [Surur) number about 200 men, and wander over the country to the south of Mecca, being entirely nomadic. They are one of the twenty-one Ashraf clans (see pp. 157 ff.), and are connected with the Dhawi Zeid. They are opposed to the Shenabrah. Sherif Dukhan is their chief Sheikh. Clans are Aulad el-Hasan and Al 'Aziz. They all obey the Sherif. (h) The BENI THAQlF, a tribe descended from Himyar m the high lands to the south of Ta'if. They are bounded on the north by the northern section of Juhadlah, on the south by the Beni Nasri, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham. They are almost entirely settled and agricultural, and grow cereals, grapes, and other fruits for the Ta'if market. For water they depend partly on the summer rains, but chiefly on well water. Nasir ibn Ghuzeil is their chief Sheikh, a firm adherent of the Sherif of Mecca. He commands about 2,000 fighting men. In times of crisis they combine with the Beni Malik, Beni Sa'd and Beni Nasri. They are always at feud with the Beni Faham and are not cordial to the Juhadlah. They possess very few camels. A certain proportion of the tribe lives permanently in Ta'if. The chief sub-tribes are Sufyan, Mu'adhdher, and Rabl'ah. (i) The BENI SA'D, a tribe which traces its descent to Himyar. It is bounded on the north by the Nasri, on the south by the Beni Malik, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham and southern Juhadlah. a r130 Their country is more fertile than that of their northern neighbours, wells being plentiful, and they raise cereals and fruits. There are no nomads amongst them. They favour the Emir of Mecca and can provide him with about 1,000 men. Hamsa ibn Mohammed is their chief Sheikh. There is enmity between them and the Shalawah, and with the Juhadlah they are by no means friendly. They combine with the Beni Thaqif, Beni Malik, and Nasri, in times of danger. 9. Tribes of the NE. Asir Borderland. Certain tribes which inhabit the region between Northern Asir and Southern iSiejd (so far as this is not occupied by the Ateibah) must be mentioned, although it is very doubtful if any of them can be regarded as predominantly nomadic. It is certain, in any case, that a large pro portion of their members are partly settled, either in the upper valleys of the inland Asiri wadis or in the Nejd oases * and it is probable that enough of them are now permanent cultivators to deprive the tribes of the Bedouin character they once had. Comparatively little, however, is known about them. The most numerous and important tribe is the SEBEP, whose home land is the ill-known region of Wadi Sebei', which lies between N. Asir and Woshm and appears to include the lower basins of two of the great Asiri wadis, Turabah and Ranyah. Not only, however, are settled Sebei' found also in towns and villages of almost all the Nejd districts, but nomad members wander even east of these into Summan, and over many parts of Eastern Tow^eiq. The nomad element of the tribe numbers at least 1,000 tents, and is divided in allegiance, the Sebei' of Wadi Turabah being tributary to the Sherif, while the rest (the larger part) acknowledge Ibn Sa'ud. The whole tribe is either Wahabite or Hanbali Sunnite. The names of some seventeen sub-tribes are known, but almost all in connexion with settled Sebei' (see p. 332). Connected with the Sebei' and possibly constituting a sub-tribe oniy are the SAHUL (or Sahul), of which nomad members range S. Nejd and into Hasa. If identical with the SHALAWAH, their homeland is Wadi Sebei . But it is practically certain that they are now more settled than nomadic, and have become only less a permanent element of the Nejd population than the Fadhul. They have probably not above .300 tents, and in religious colour and political allegiance follow the Sebei'. The BUQUM are intimately connected with the two foregoing tribes, but are both more predominantly nomadic and less scattered abroad. They are found in the basins of all the inland Asiri wadis, including Wadi Bishah, and appear to be accepted equally by the Ateibah on the north and the Qahtan on the south, and to divide their allegiance in the same manner as the Sebei'. They are said to have about 500 tents.131 C. Tribes of the Central South 1. The Qahtdn. The QAHTAN are almost the only very ancient Arabian people which still maintains its importance as a tribal unit. They are, accord ing to Arab tradition, the mother-stock of the Ahl Qibli, and it is not improbable that for a very long period of time they may have occupied their present district near the southern limits of the habitable desert. No travellers have penetrated into their country and little is known about them. Strange, and seemingly quite baseless, accounts of their customs are repeated among the northern tribes ; for, like all distant and unknown peoples, they are a peg on which to hang marvels. Their country lies to the west of Hautah and is divided into three districts, Hasat, Areiji, and Tathlith, the last being near Asir. The Shahran and the Sebei' lie to the west, the Dawasir to the south and south-west, the Buqum and Shalawah to the north. Somewhere north of Bishah is the Bilad Qahtan, with a group of villages known as the Qahtaniyah (Tarid, 'Azim, and Kir'an are among their number), and the Beni Wahab villages inhabited by a small tribe of that name. The Qahtan acknowledge the authority of Ibn Sa'ud and join him in his raiding expeditions. So far as they are Moslems at all, they are Hanbali Sunnites or Wahabites. They come up to Shaqrah in the Woshm for dates, and when they are camping in the southern parts of their country they buy dates from the Dawasir villagers, but they themselves have no lands in the valley and are not cultivators. They are very rich in camels, which are sold to the Qasim buyers when the herds come north, towards Nejd. The settled section of the Qahtan, which includes six autonomous tribes and owns the paramount authority of Mohammed ibn Duleim, is dealt with later (p. 187). 2. The Dawdsir. The nomadic DAWASIR are Wahabite and more or less under Ibn Sa'ud. Half-settled, they have villages in the Wadi Dawasir which they inhabit during the summer. They breed camels, though not in such large quantities as the Qahtan. The Qasim dealers do not come as far south as the Dawasir, but the latter bring their camels into the Hasa and dispose of them there to the Qusman. The Dawasir have overflowed into the easterly provinces of southern Nejd, and now form a considerable settled element in Aflaj, where they are the chief owners of land, worked by men of the fellah tribe of Beni Khadhlr. To a less extent they are found also in Hariq and 'Aridh, where they contribute a proportion of the village and even the town popula tion. Small parties of their nomads wander between Nejd and Hasa and trouble the routes. A considerable body is settled in Bahrein. Indeed, so small a proportion of the Dawasir is in any sense Bedouin that the tribe hardly comes within our purview here, and it is not worth while to enumerate its imperfectly known sub-sections. r 2132 D. Tribes of the Central East i . The Shammar. The SHAMMAR are northern Arabs. They do not spring from a single ancestor, but account for themselves by saying that they are a mixture of Taghlib, 'Abs, and Hawazin, the first a constituent of Rabi'ah, the two last of Mudhar. The Ja'far, to which the ruling family of the Rashid belongs, is a sub-tribe of 'Abdah, and the 'Abdah claim descent from the 'Abidah, a part of the settled Qahtan: they could, therefore, be Yemenites. Beyond these vague traditions, the Shammar are ignorant of their own history before they established themselves in Jebel Shammar, 4 the two mountains of Tayy ' frequently mentioned in pre-Mohammedan literature, where they displaced (and probably partly incorporated) the ancient Tayy nation, a branch of the Qahtan. About the middle of the seventeenth century they began to stretch their frontiers into the Syrian desert, where they encountered, and, after a brief struggle, defeated, the Mawali, then the most powerful tribe in the northern steppe, driving them into the north-east borders of Syria. Early in the nineteenth century the Anazah forced the Shammar northwards across the Euphrates, and split the tribe into two parts, interposing themselves between these two in the Syrian desert. Thus the Shammar of Jebel Shammar and those of the Jezirah (Mesopotamia) came to be geographically and politically distinct. The southern group follows Ibn Rashid, the northern Ibn Jerba. But ethnologically they are one ; the same sub-tribes are found in either group, and though they do not offer united resistance to their common enemy, the Anazah, they are always on terms of friendship with one another. Any small sheikh of the Jezirah may bring down his tents and flocks to J. Shammar for a year's pasturage, if he be so minded. The SOUTHERN SHAMMAR must be considered, not only as a powerful nomad tribe, but also as the masters of the oases in J. Shammar. The settled population of the latter is mostly of the Beni Tamlm, an ancient branch of Mudhar which once inhabited all north-east Arabia, but now has relinquished the nomadic life (see p. 136). The Shammar, for their part, are nomads, though they come down to the oases during the summer drought. The Emir of J. Shammar plays a double part. He is Paramount Chief of his own tribal confederation; but also he is ruler of a settled country, of which Ha'il is the capital, a prince with a fixed habitation, exercising authority over other Bedouins whose connexion with him is not tribal but political. The Shammar tribal frontiers remain more or less unchanged, but the sphere of the Emir's influence varies with the vicissitudes of his dynastic fortunes. The Shammar tribe ranges the south-east Nefud and the country to the north almost up to Nejef. To the east its limits have been some what restricted by the Dhaflr, who are always at feud with it and encroach upon its dlra. Since the old eastern pilgrim road, the Darb Zobeidah, is133 seldom safe from Dhafir raids, it has been abandoned by the Emir's caravans in favour of a more westerly track past the fortified wells of Hayyanlyah; but the proper Shammar pasture grounds extend up to it and across it. To the north, the loss of Jauf el-'Amr has shut the Shammar into the Nefud. They do not wander far beyond Jebel Trnan on the west, nor southwards beyond Mustajiddah; while the summer camping-ground of Beidha Nethil is occupied sometimes by Shammar, but mostly by the Anazah of the Teima district. The political influence of Ha'il has decreased notably since the death of the Emir Mohammed, in 1897. At the height of his power he ruled over Riyadh and the Qasim, and levied tribute from the northern Harb, the Huteim, Fuqara, Wuld Suleiman, and Beni Wahab. The Southern Shammar tribes, great breeders of sheep and camels, number something under 4,000 tents. The villages of J. Shammar contain probably not much over 20,000 souls. Both tribesmen and villagers are devotedly loyal to the Emir. The subject tribes from whom he might be able, on occasion, to raise fighting men, number at most 1,200 tents. Teima, which is subject to him, must have a population of from 1,500 to 2,000. At a rough estimate Ibn Rashld could probably raise from 500 to 800 fighting men from the villages, and 2,000 from the Shammar tribes. He might obtain another 500 or 600 from the tribes bet ween Jebel Shammar and Teima, though their support would always be doubtful. The tribes men would bring their own camels, but they would depend on the Emir for food and ammunition. The villagers he would have to mount and arm as well as feed. His own camel herds, seriously reduced in numbers since the days of the Emir Mohammed, may now amount to about 1,000 camels, including those which are not yet fit for service. The Shammar tribes are not as rich in camels as the Anazah, but they must average some 20-30 camels to a tent, which would bring the numbers up to 80,000 or rather more, including breeding camels and calves. The relations between the Shammar and the Muteir are usually hostile. With the Dhafir the Shammar are always at feud, but the Muntefiq were recently on good terms with Ibn Rashid. The Huteim are out of hand and raid Shammar territories when the Emir is occupied with distant expeditions against the Ruweilah or the Dhafir. On the western borders the Huweitat are the foes of all Shammar, except the sub-tribe of Rammal, with whom one of the Huweiti Paramount Sheikhs is connected by marriage. The Beni 'Atlyah are hereditary enemies, and the Juheinah and Billi raid both the Wuld Suleiman and the Shammar. Arab tribal federations or states, however, are held together only by an autocratic ruler, and their strength increases or diminishes in exact ratio to his weight and capacity. The Southern Shammar had their day under the Emir Mohammed. Since his death they have been handi capped by the violence and folly of their leaders. But, nevertheless, their numbers, their great tradition, and the support of the Ottoman Govern ment make them still one of the chief factors in Central Arabian politics.134 The NORTHERN SHAMMAR of the Jezirah are variously estimated. Probably a total of 2,000 tents is not far from the true figure ; but they have been put as high as 10,000 tents. Their pasture-grounds are between the Tigris and the Euphrates, though occasionally they cross the Tigris in the region of the Lesser Zab. They come down to Baghdad and even south of Baghdad as far as Zobar. To the west they extend to Deir ez-Zor, which is a head-quarters of the tribe ; thence north up the Khabur and to near Nisibin they wander over the fertile desert which is watered by the Jaghjagh and its affluents. They are at feud with their Anazah neighbours, both Fed'an and 'Amarat, and usually on bad terms with the Kurdish tribes to the north and north-east. Traditional rebels against Ottoman authority, they slip between the fingers of the Mutesarrif of Deir and the Vali of Mosul, paying taxes to neither. They exact dues from the caravans on the Tigris road and not infrequently hold up the traffic along this important link between Asia Minor and Baghdad, forcing travellers, and sometimes even the Government post, to take the longer route by Irbil and Kerkuk. The keleks on the river are subject to their exactions also. In I9ii,the cup of their iniquities having over flowed, Nazim Pasha, then Vali of the Traq, sent an expedition against them under his Chief of Staff, Hasan Riza Bey (murdered during the siege of Scutari in the following year). He conducted matters very skilfully. I he Shammar came in without resistance, camel- and sheep-dues, many years in arrear, were collected at a great camp formed at Hatrah, and the rights of the tribe over the Mosul road were defined. But the fall of Nazim immediately afterwards, and the resignation of Hasan Riza, took the heart out of this agreement. The Shammar of the Jezirah are all under the Sheikhly family of the J erban, who sprang into political importance about 1830 with Sheikh Sufuq ibn Jerba, a bitter enemy of the Turks. His eldest son, Ferhan, was a lover of peace and kept on good terms with the Government ; but the contest was continued by Ferhan's brothers, of whom the youngest, Faris, took refuge in J. Shammar with Ibn Rashid. He returned to the Jezirah in the seventies, and from that time shared the position of Paramount Sheikh, with Ferhan. He took the camping-grounds on the Khabur, while Ferhan held those round Mosul with his head-quarters at Hatrah and on the brackish springs of the Wadi Tharthar. In 1911 'Asi, the eldest of Ferhan's sixteen sons, was appointed by Hasan Riza Bey Paramount Sheikh, and made responsible to the Government for all Mesopotamian Shammar. He is a man advanced in years, peaceable and upright. He keeps to the Mosul district, while two of his cousins, Abd el-Muhsin and Mohammed, sons of 'Abd el-Kerim, roam the Khabur country. The sons of Faris are young and not of much account. The eldest now living, Mish'al, is nephew, through his mother, of Noweidis et-Timyat of the Tuman (Shammar of the Jebel). Some of the many sons of Ferhan own cultivated land on the southern reaches of the Tigris, and one, Humeidi, has almost dropped nomad habits and passes much of his time in a house which he has built in Baghdad.136 Tribe.

The BENI TAMIM are a famous stock of the northern people, who played an important part in Arabian history before the age of the prophet, when they extended from the Syrian desert to Yemamah. They maintain their ancient seat, for they still form a large proportion of the settled population of Nejd and Jebel Shammar; the oases of Qashn are almost exclusively inhabited by them and by the Beni Khalid. But they are no longer an independent tribe ; they acknowledge the authority of Ibn Sa'ud or of Ibn Rashid. At a very early date, probably before the Mohammedan invasion^ they began to come up into Meso potamia, where they are still to be found near Tarmlyah (some 1,500 families). All these are shepherds, and while the Tamim of Nejd are strifct Wahabites, their kinsmen of Mesopotamia are Shiahs. 3. The Dhafir [or Dhufir). The DHAFIR form an important tribe whose district extends south of the Shatt el-'Arab and Euphrates from near Zobeir to Samawah. From Samawah a line drawn almost due south to the vicinity of Hafar in the Batin would mark their frontier, and the depression of the Batin forms the SE. side of the triangle which encloses their territory. Their neighbours are the Muntefiq Confederation to the NE., the Shammar to the W., the Muteir and 'Ajman to the E., while to the south they are in touch with the Sebei', one of the tribes which acknowledge the authority of Ibn Sa'ud. The Samld section, and more particularly the Juwasim (or Jawasim, orig. Qawasim), are accustomed to cross the Euphrates in the summer and pasture their flocks in the Traq.137 The Dhafir are foes of the Muteir and are almost always on bad terms with the Shammar, whom they raid when they are in their spring pastur ages east of the Nefud. They harry the Darb Zobeidah and hold up the Emir's caravans from Ha'il to Nejef; indeed the Darb Zobeidah has become so unsafe that the western pilgrimage road is now almost always chosen by caravans in preference to it. For the past year, however, the Paramount Sheikh, Hamud ibn Suweit, has been at peace with Ibn Rashid, though he is said to have rejected the latter's proposal that he should join him in aiding 'Ajeimi ibn Sa'dun and the Turks against the British. The Shammar sub-tribe of the 'Ajil are still hostile to the Dhafir. With the Anazah they are always at feud, and though the Anazah sheikhs seldom approach within four or five days' journey of their country, the Dhafir carry their raids as far north as Shifathah, and west into the Anazah pastures. They are on good terms with some of the Muntefiq group, of whom the Budur camp habitually under their protection in the spring, when the latter go out with their sheep into the desert. But with the Sa'dun themselves their relations have been anything but cordial, and since 1915 Hamud has definitely sided against 'Ajeimi ; but he has not succeeded in carrying his whole tribe with him, and the Husein and Dhar'an sections, as well as other smaller sheikhs of the Samid, have followed 'Ajeimi's lead against us. The Dhafir are composed of two main sub-tribes, the Butun and the Samid, of which the Butun is the more numerous. It is not a homo geneous tribal unit, but has been formed from sections of other tribes which have been welded together. The various constituents have pre served the memory of their origin ; the Suweit and the Beni Husein are Ashraf of the Hejaz ; the Sa'id, 'Areif, and Beni Khalid, with the Kathir, who are an offshoot of the Beni Khalid, are Qahtan ; the 'Adwan are Ahl esh-Shimal, descended from Rabi'ah or Mudhar; the Misamir and the small Tuluh clans are Anazah; the Rasimi are Shammar; the Mu'aleim are Beni Tamim, and the Juwasim are from the neighbouring Sebei'. The important Dhar'an section are 'Abid, that is to say, they spring from the slaves of some nomad group. The Dhafir are wholly nomadic and do not engage in any trade. Their country is sufficiently supplied with wells, and they own large flocks of sheep, besides being breeders of camels. In religion they are Sunnis of the Maliki sect. They are well armed with modern rifles, and may number some 3,000 fighting men. They maintain good relations with the Sultan of Koweit, and come into Koweit for needful provisions and utensils. Sections of the tribe near the Koweit territory have occa sionally paid the Sultan tribute; while in the days of Mohammed er- Rashid, the western sections of the Dhafir yielded tribute to the Shammar. The paramount Sheikh, Hamud ibn Suweit, is a man of about 45, intelli gent, and reckoned a fairly good politician and tribal administrator. His son, Barghash, is a boy of 17.138 Tribe. Butun.

The Muteir and the Barnyah. The MUTEIR, closely akin to their western neighbours, the Harb and the Ateibah, are people of the north, claiming descent through Mudhar from Ma'add. Their territory touches the Persian Gulf round Koweit, and runs down the Batin till it reaches Ibn Sa'ud's district near Zilfi. The Beni Khalid and the 'Ajman lie to the south. A turbulent tribe, some 1,500 tents strong, the Muteir stand in close relations with the Sultan of Koweit ; but with Ibn Rashid they are perpetually at feud, and no year passes without raiding expeditions from one dira to the other. It was a Muteiri who in 1908 killed the Emir 'Abd el-'Aziz, father of the present Emir of Ha'il, at Raudhat el-Mahanna, near Boreidah. The Muteir harry the outlying settlements of Qasim, and not infrequently interrupt the caravan traffic to the Gulf. Their principal Sheikh, Feisal ed-Derwish, pastures in the Koweit area, and is lord over some 800 tents. All the Muteir belong to the confederation of Ibn Sa'ud, and contribute fighting men to his raiding expeditions. They are camel-breeders and entirely nomadic ; they possess no cultivated ground. The BARRl YAH are an independent tribe, but so closely allied with the Muteir that they are often held to be of the same stock. In all poli tical relations they are at one with the Muteir, and, like them, they come under the authority of Ibn Sa'ud. Their pasturages are in Qasim. The last report concerning them is that they opposed 'Abdullah, the second son of the Sherif, when he raided Sedeir at the end of 1914 in order to collect overdue taxes from the eastern Ateibah, and that after some fighting they were defeated.139 MUTEIR AND BARRlYAH T ribe.

Stranded witnesses to its former wide range are to be found in a Khalid element of the settled population of Qasim (especially at Aneizah), of Zilfi in Sedeir, of Malham in 'Aridh, and elsewhere in Nejd. The main remnant, however, is the Bedouin tribe of the name which ranges north of the 'Ajman on the Gulf shore between the Wadi Maqta' on the north and the middle of the Bayadh district on the south. Inland they wander into the Summan plateau. Scattered communities have settled in various outside localities, e.g. Oman, Musallamiyah Island, Qatlf, the Hasa Oasis, Bahrein, and Koweit, where the tribesmen have become pearl-fishers, &amp;c. The nomads own considerable date-groves. Up to 1830 the Beni Khalid ruled the Hasa ; but they had long been at war with the Wahabites, to whom, being themselves Maliki Sunnites, they are unsympathetic, and they finally succumbed to the Emir Turki of Riyadh. Latterly, after recognizing Turkish suzerainty, more or less, for forty odd years, they have come again under Riyadh. They are great breeders of horses and cattle, and cultivate more than most Bedouins. Their tents are noted for their great size ; and in dress (they wear the line Hasa abbas), deportment, physiognomy, and coloration these nomads are more like oasis-dwellers than Bedouins. They number about 14,000 souls, and claim to send out 4^000 fighting-men. They are in alliance with the 'Ajman and share diras with that tribe, but maintain feuds with the Muteir and the Ahl Murrah. A small isolated section ranges north of Koweit with the Dhafir. The tribe is well armed and more trustworthy than the 'Ajman. Its Paramount Chief is the Sheikh of a settled clan, Al Khalid, of the 'A ma'ir sub-tribe, who lives on the island of Musallamiyah. s 2140 BEN1 KHAL1D Sub-Tribe. ' Aniair . Clan.

The 'AJMAN, who range south of the Beni Khalid, trace their descent to Qahtan through Nafura of Nejran ; but this pedigree is not accepted by Arab genealogists in general. They are, however, an important Bedouin tribe, which is the strongest nomad unit on the Gulf Coast, although its claim to turn out 10,000 fighting-men is excessive. It is singularly at one within itself, its different sub-tribes and clans not having distinct diras, or falling into sectional groups. 'Ajmi tribesmen of all sections may be found in any camp in any part of the range of the tribe. They also appear to have unusual instinct for federation with their weaker neighbours, thus securing more elbow-room. Under ordinary conditions both the Beni Khalid and the Beni Hajar are its allies, and the 'Ajman have free range in their diras. The whole tribe is well provided with breach-loading firearms, and being Sunnite of the Hanbali School, it is sympathetic to Wahabism, and has some of its dour spirit. Its proper summer range is the Gulf lowlands from Taff down to 'Oqair, enveloping the Hasa oasis on north and east. Inland it ranges back over the Summan plateau, where its herdsmen wander in winter as far west as the confines of Sedeir ; and at the same season 'Ajman push even into Kharj. On the littoral they straggle sometimes into El-Qatar, and habitually wander north up to Koweit, relying on their agreement with the Beni Khalid, whose proper dira they thus invade. They are to be found, therefore, at one season or another, over an area of not less than 20,000 square miles. Very few 'Ajmi tribesmen have ever adopted settled life, though they own some date-groves in Hasa. Their wealth lies in horses, camels, and the smaller cattle. In particular they are horse-breeders. They may total between 4,000 and 5,000 tents. During the Ottoman occupation of Hasa and Qatif, the 'Ajman were consistently recalcitrant, in spite of subsidies doled out to their sheikhs, and the screw which could be put upon the tribe when, according to its custom, it camped near Hofuf, and wished to dispose of live stock, &amp;c., in the local markets. They maintained the while relations of old standing with the Emirs of Riyadh, and welcomed 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Sa'ud when he invaded Hasa in 1913. But when his became the established141 government, the 'Ajman liked him and his taxes little better than the Turks, and he had to organize drastic punishment of their raiding in the summer of 1915, finally driving great part of them north into Shammar country. Their traditional foe is the Ahl Murrah tribe, and of late they have added Ibn Rashid and the Shammar. With the Sultan of Koweit and the Paramount Sheikh of El-Qatar they have generally, though not invariably, kept on terms. The Paramount Chieftainship is in the Ibn Hithlein family of the M a 'I dh sub-tribe (Naja' clan). On the murder of Mohammed ibn Hazm ibn Hithlein in 1910, the chieftainship was put in commission ; Sheikh Fahd, the elder brother of the late chief, had most support for the sole succession, but he appears to have given way later to Sheikh Theldan, who submitted to Riyadh at the end of 1915- I he Naja' clan is said to be in close alliance with the S ifran sub-tribe, which, though not numerous, contains the most formidable of all the 'Ajmi fighting- men. According to Lorimer {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf), the Jiblan section of the Muteir (q. v.) joined forces with the 'Ajman before 1908. Sub-Fribe. Ma'ldh .

Beni Hajar. The BENI HAJAR (or Hajir, often pronounced by Bedouins Hayir) are nomads of bad reputation, ranging Hasa and part of El-Qatar, south of the 'Ajman, with whom they have an agreement allowing them to use the 'Ajmi dira, if provided with authorized rafiqs. They were always troublesome to the Turks, and are so now to both Ibn Sa'ud and the Sheikh of El-Qatar. They are pastoral ancl breeders, but are said also to make excur sions into piracy. They allow their women great liberty. Their extreme range is from 'Odeid to the 'Ajman limit in Hasa; but by consent they wander as far north as Koweit. They have no one Paramount Chief.142 Theii total strength is about 6,000 souls, and they claim to have 1,500 fighting-men. The two sub-tribes are at feud. BEN1 HAJAR Clan. Dibisah. Faheid. Hamrah.

The A hi Murrah, The AHL MURRAH (Ahl Morra), a savage and ill-known tribe, wholly nomadic, range to the south of Hasa, into the Jafurah Desert, and down to the wild oasis of Jabrin which lies beyond on the confines of the great South Desert. On the north they come up to near 'Oqair, while inland they lie south of the Hofuf-Riyadh routes (which they harry) as far as the borders of Kharj. In most of this inhospitable tract they wander alone, and neither the Turks nor the Ibn Sa'uds (whose feudatories they nominally are) have ever been able to follow them far enough to subdue them. In 1915-16 they gave the Emir of Riyadh a great deal of trouble. Their savagery and treachery are due mainly to the wild character of their dira, but perhaps their evil reputation is due also in some degree to the small knowledge of them possessed by the outside world. They have, however, physical and linguistic peculiarities, which make it possible that they are survivors of the pre-Arab population of the Peninsula,like the inhabitants of Ras Musandam and the southern Mahrah. They are virtually pagans, but profess, on occasion, Islam of the Hanbali School, which is akin to Wahabism. They are as ill-armed as they are ill- provided with any domestic apparatus or clothing in advance of the Stone Age ; but they are brave fighters, who have twice in recent years made short work of Turkish punitive detachments. They own many camels. They are said to number about 7,000 souls, and to turn out 2,000 Sub-Tribe. M akhadhabah 1 mainly in El-Qatar). Ahl Mohammed (mainly in Hasa).143 fighting men. Their Paramount Chief is the Sheikh of the Fuheidah clan of the ShabIb (or Bishr) sub-tribe, which is notorious for outrages com mitted on travellers, fishermen, and Turks.

The MANAS IR are a small independent tribe in the ill-known Dhafrah district, bordering on the domain of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom, if to any one, they owe a vague allegiance, having for a generation or so been free of tribute to Ibn Sa'ud. They are the last predominantly nomadic tribe towards the south, the Great Desert and the Jafurah Desert enclosing their dira S. and W., and the mainly settled and friendly Beni Yas of the Trucial Coast lying E. North lies the dira of the Ahl Murrah, with whom the Manasir seem to be on better terms than any one else is. In winter the whole tribe moves into or near El-Qatar. In summer part of it may be found as far south as the Bireimi Oasis in NW. Oman. Mainly pastoral, the Manasir possess arable land and summer settlements in Dhafrah (Liwah district), and are much in advance of the Ahl Murrah in civilization. Both in religious tenets and political connexions they pertain to Oman. There seems to be no Paramount Mansuri Chief. The tribe does not number above 1,500 souls. MANASIR Sub-Tribe. M undhir.

The Sherdrdt. The SHERARAT are not reckoned among the Arabs as Bedu, that is to say, they do not spring from either of the great nomad families, Qahtan or Nizar. They are said to be of one stock with the Huteim who, like the Sherarat, are not astl, of known race, and the true Bedouins will not intermarry with them. 1 Nor is there any definite area over which they exercise acknowledged rights of possession ; they have not their own dira, but camp with other tribes. Their tents are scattered from Jebel Duruz in the north to Teima in the south, and east from Kerak to Jebel Shammar. They are to be found among the Sukhur, the Huweitat, the Ruweilah,andthe Shammar, either in the encampments of the big Sheikhs, or by preference khaldwi, i.e. solitary, in the wilderness. In summer small numbers of Sherarat gather round the fast-drying waterholes and the permanent wells, when the big tribes have moved off with their herds towards the Hejaz Railway and the Jordan valley, or out into the depths of the Hamad. At Hausa in the Jebel Tubeiq, and at Imleih and 'Obeid on the edges of the Nefud, they find enough water for their slender needs, and the hard surface of the desert is covered with the circular marks of their threshing-floors where in August they harvest the wild semh. The Sherarat honour an ancestor called Suleim, who is buried in the Wadi Mojib, but they seldom visit his tomb. They have a cult for 'Aqil Walad 'Azzam, whose tomb is in the Jebel Tubeiq. They regard the Jebel Tubeiq as their own special dira, while the Sukhur and the Huweitat are intruders. In Ibn Rashid's country the Sherarat will pay tribute to him ; in Moab they pay tribute to the Ottoman Government. Wherever they may be, they must buy the goodwill of the Paramount Sheikh of that region. They are skilled hunters, and their camels are said to be the best in Western Arabia, especially as freight-carriers. Although their small tents are almost destitute of furniture and their coffee-hearths are bare, many of the Sherarat are well-to-do. A man clothed in rags may be the owner of 20 camels, and a Sherari sheikh is a rich man in the desert. But a hunter wandering solitary for a year or more, with his tiny tent, his wife, his single camel and little flock of goats, living mainly on such animals as he can trap, content with black cakes of semh seed in place of bread, and chewing the green weeds of early spring like one of his own goats, has brought the amenities of existence to the irreducible minimum. The men take service with the cultivators of the Jizah district, and often settle down among them; but their former trade of supplying the Hajj camels with grass from the Nefud has vanished with the opening of the railway. 1 They are sometimes reckoned, however, as descendants of the Beni Hilal.145 2. The Huteim. Closely related to the Sherarat are the HUT EIM (Heteym), and they are even more widely scattered. They are to be found on the Persian Gulf, in Yemen, on the Red Sea, and in Egypt ; but their main range is in Central Arabia, from near Medina, north-east to Jebel Shammar. Ihe name Huteim is used carelessly by the Arabs as a synonym for any base- born, half-settled tribe. The Huteim are rich and numerous ; those of the Kheibar and Medina districts pay taxes to the Government, while those of Jebel Shammar used to be taxed by Ibn Rashid, but are now out of hand and raid his villages when he is away with his fighting-men. The Huteim breed excellent riding-camels, and own large flocks of sheep and goats. Their women are renowned for beauty, but would not be taken in marriage by any Bedouin of good stock. 1 he men are reputed to be timid and of no value as fighters. 3. The Sulubba. The SULUBBA (Solubba) are an interesting tribe about whose origin nothing certain is known. Probably they are the dispersed remnants of some old stock ; but legend has been busy with their ancestry, and has given them as forbears the Indian dancers of Harun er-Rashid's court at Baghdad. They are sprinkled over the whole of nomad Arabia, but the various groups under their separate sheikhs keep to their own regions, where they ply their trades as smiths, tinkers, carpenters, and cattle- surgeons among the Bedouins and the oasis-dwellers. Their skill in hunting has passed into fable with the Arabs ; and in fact they are so expert that they live well, even in the most barren wilderness, from the fruits of the chase. They are well-to-do, earning an ample livelihood by their craftsmanship, and they travel without fear throughout all the desert, where no thief would rob them and no raider harry them. Their knowledge of the country is unsurpassed. They have no camels ; their beasts of burden are donkeys, the best breed being a large white ass almost as powerful as a mule. They rear herds of sheep and goats in the Hamad, and their tents are well stocked with every kind of nomad gear. A northern Sulubbi will wear in winter a warm robe of gazelle- skins. The Bedouins accuse them of eating carrion and beasts that have died of themselves, as well as vermin ; and there would seem to be truth in the first charge as far as the Suleib (Soleyb) and Ghaneimi are concerned, and in the second if it is limited to locusts and hedgehogs (the locust, however, is a delicacy much prized not only by the Sulubba, but by all nomads). It is impossible to estimate the numbers of the tribe, since they never assemble in any one place. 4. The Sunna\ The SUNN A' are the smiths' caste, sometimes settled in the villages and sometimes wandering with the tribes {Sunnd' is plural of Sani = artizan, smith). They are braziers, farriers, tinners, blacksmiths, and a t14B workers in wood and stone among the tribes and in the oases. Thus they are both villagers and nomads. They may marry with the Huteim but with no Bedouins. They are probably a different race from the Arabs, and are distinguished from them by their features. 5. The Nawdr. The NAWAR are gipsies found in Arabia as in other parts of the universe, but not in great numbers. Their habits and activities are the same there as elsewhere. 6. The Hawazin. The HAWAZIN (Hawazim or 'Awazim) are a nomad tribe which is not admitted to marriage and fellowship by true Arabs. As a considerable tribal unit it is found only in and about the principality of Koweit, ranging from the outskirts of the town itself (where some 250 Hawazin families are settled), down the coast nearly to Musallamlyah, and for some distance inland. They must be the ' Koweit nomads' who, Raunkiaer says, graze their herds south of the town in winter and resort in summer northwards to the districts round Zobeir, and also control the wells of Tawil. There are also, however, Hawazin elsewhere, who have the same sort of status, but are members of Huteim or Harb (e g. in Jauf el-'Amr, leima, Sedeir, &amp;c.); and there is a distinct Harb clan of the name at Wadi el-Kheif near Jebel Fiqra (see H arb). The Koweit Hawazin are partly pastoral, partly follow marine occupations—pearl-diving and fishing. They are great breeders of camels, often taking service (e. g. at Qatif) under alien masters for stud-labour. They are subjects of Koweit, and form the bulk of the Sultan's fighting forces : it is due also to their activities that he is able to claim Bubiyan Island, to which some of their herdsmen resort. They are allied with the 'Ajman, and number some 4,000 souls. It appears that they are comparatively new-comers into Koweit territory, and their tradition is that they were formerly with the Harb in East Hejaz. The one thing certain is that they are regarded by Bedouins as of the same standing as Huteim or Sulubba, and credited with secret non-Islamic beliefs. In fact, however, they are Maliki Sunnites.148 claim descent; this seems to have disappeared and left no trace. 1 he modern 'Uqeil are all Nejd Arabs, townsfolk or nomads of any tribe from Hasa, 'Aridh, Qasim or Jebel Shammar; but men of Sedeir and the Wadi Dawasir are not admitted; nor are members admitted from any of the big tribes, such as the Harb and Ateibah, who are engaged in interminable blood feuds, the object being to keep the 'Uqeil society neutral. Settled Beni Tamim and Beni Khalid of Nejd and Qasim are most suitable for its purposes. The head-quarters of the society are at Baghdad, and its president, who is always a native of Boreidah, lives at Baghdad and there enrolls the members. The 'Uqeil are of two kinds: J emam I l, camel-men forming the fraternity of caravan leaders, and D hogorti, poor men, pedlars and mercenaries, who help to compose an irregular cavalry under the Otto man flag and serve as escort to the Hajj and as guards to the kellas, (stations or halting-places), on the Hajj road. These last do not belong to the society. The true 'Uqeil are recognized throughout Arabia as professional guides whose presence vouches for a caravan of merchants or travellers and removes it from all suspicion of hostile intentions. It is the 'Uqeil who conduct the camel-trade of the desert, being employed by the dealers of Damascus to purchase from the tribes in Arabia, in the Syrian desert, and in Mesopotamia. Such an institution as this society, with universal freedom of passage, is essential to the conduct of business in Arabia, where no tribesman, unless he be engaged on a raiding expedition, dare venture outside his own tribal territory for fear of hereditary feuds and enmities which imperil his existence. Thanks to their recognition as carriers by all Arab tribes, the 'Uqeil can be of great service to a European traveller, as they are in a position to conduct him anywhere in more or less security, provided he agrees to go by their route and at their pace. It is very dangerous for such a traveller to assume the character of an 'Uqeil: but Arabs, who wish to shield the caravan in which the traveller is from molestation, will sometimes impose it on him (this was done to Shakespear near Wadi el-'Arabah in 1914). His best course, then, is, on the approach of any stranger, to feign illness and remain rolled up, face and all.SEDENTARY TRIBES OF THE NORTH-WEST (A) BELQA The Belqa is a district east of Jordan and the Dead Sea, which extends roughly from Zerqa, north-east of 'Amman (Ammon), to the Wadi Zerqa, south of the ancient Christian village of Madeba, and eastward nearly to Qasr el-Azraq. The Jebel Hauran and the Jebel 'Ajlun bound it on the north. The BENI SAKHR are the predominant tribe in its southern reaches, the RUWEILAH penetrate into the eastern pasturages near Azraq, the 'ADWAN are paramount over the Jordan valley (the Ghor), the Beq'a (i.e. the hills between the Ghor and the Heshban), and the lands round Heshban. The smaller tribes of the Belqa acknowledge the authority of the principal 'Adwan Sheikh, Sultan ibn 'Ali Dhi'ab, whose head-quarters are at Heshban ; and it will therefore be convenient to treat the whole of the BELQAWlYAH, including the 'Adwan, under one head. They are a half-settled people, scattered pretty thickly over a com paratively small area; for though the Belqa is not in extent consider able, it is a country rich in pasturage, with plentiful rains in winter, and supports a much larger population than any corresponding area of the Hamad. At a moderate reckoning there must be at least 4,500 tents within its confines, in addition to the big villages of Salt, 'Amman, and Madeba, which hold permanently settled inhabitants. 1 It contains much cultivated land and still more which would repay husbandry. The valleys leading down to J ordan are full of timber, oak, terebinth, and smaller trees, and even the uplands might be well wooded, but for the depredations of the goats and charcoal-burners. Round Salt the hill sides are terraced for vineyards, and the gardens of the sturdy Christian and Moslem population are planted with fruit-trees. The pasture grounds of Heshban are famous, and Madeba, which is still largely Christian, is set in cornfields. At 'Amman an industrious Circassian colony has filled the valley with gardens and poplar groves, constructed roads along which they can drive their two-wheeled carts, and covered the slopes of the hills with corn. Innumerable ruin-fields, remains of villages of the Christian period before the Mohammedan invasion, testify to the fertility of the soil, and its capacity for carrying a larger population. In the winter the warm Jordan valley is favourable for early crops, and forms an ideal refuge for flocks and herds. Unhappily the edges of the desert suffer notoriously from the short comings of the Turkish administration. Since 1895 the Ottoman Govern ment has occupied Kerak and Ma'an, placing a mutesarrif at the former and a kaimmakam at the latter; there are mudirs at Walah, Tafilah, 1 The villagers themselves are grouped into tribal confederations.150 and Sh5bak, a kaimmakam at Salt, and mudirs at Madeba and 'Amman. W itli the opening of the railway to Ma'an in 1905 communications have been facilitated and small military posts are established along the line. The results have been disappointing. The Belqawiyah, like all the border tribes, have lost touch with the desert law, though they have not acquired any other code in its place. They maintain a tribal organiza tion and a vast network of tribal feuds in which the Ottoman Govern ment seldom interferes, even on behalf of settlers, Circassian, Christian, or Moslem. Ihe whole country is turbulent, crime abounds and justice is almost non-existent. Ihe villagers protect themselves as best they can, partly by force of arms, but mostly by paying tribute to the Arab Sheikhs in the form of unstinted hospitality and liberal propitiation by gifts in kind. The Circassians, a race detested by the Arabs, incur more hostility from the tribes than other townsfolk, but are also better able to hold their own, being born fighters and well armed. Though the disputes often lead to bloodshed, they are usually small affairs, petty robberies taking the place of raids among the border tribes. But in the summer, when great numbers of the Beni Sakhr come up to the northern pasturages, and the Anazah draw in from the east, the Belqa is the scene of continuous disturbance, ranging from pitched battles to the satisfaction of individual blood-feuds, and no established authority intervenes. Yet it is just in such frontier lands as these that any strong ad ministration would seize its chance, and herein lies the political impor tance of tribes like the Belqawiyah. They are cultivators, after the inefficient manner of the Arabs, and like all the half-settled people their numbers are surprisingly large in comparison with those of purely nomadic tribes. They have few camels, and those which they possess are bought from the Bedouins, not bred by themselves ; but they rear large flocks of sheep and goats, and live richly on their milk during the spring. 1 he fact that they own cultivated ground should give the Government a firm hold over them ; they are immobilized thereby, nor do their pastoral conditions give them the means of rapid transport. Their numbers \\ ould make them a solid barrier between their wandering kinsmen, who can slip through the fingers of the law at any moment leaving no pledge behind, and the permanently settled lands. Moreover, their geographical position makes them the first problem to be dealt with, a problem on which the security of wide and fertile regions, now lying to a great extent derelict, must depend. . A group of the 'ADWAN, some 700 tents, is seated in Mesopotamia at Qorinshar, west of the Khabur. Numerically the largest of the Belqa tribes are the BENI HASAN, who are sometimes counted among the Jebeliyah since they are an offshoot from one of that group, the Ghiyadh. Ihey go up into the slopes of the Druze hills, and sometimes wander into the volcanic country to the east. The SHAWABKAH, as their name indicates, come from Shobak and are a new tribe ; but151 the 'Adwan are an old confederation tracing their descent through Qeis to Mudhar, a respectable lineage. The 'A J ARM AH venerate an ancestor, Sobah, who, they relate, came from lands farther east. His son, 'Ajram, is the eponymous founder of the tribe. No doubt all the Belqawiyah are, like the 'Adwan, Ahl esh-Shamal, and though their own stories of their parentage are mere legend and usually devoid of any historic basis, it is reasonable to conjecture that they must have taken part in the gradual sweep northwards of the Hejaz tribes after the Mohammedan conquest. They displaced and even wholly obliterated the powerful Yemenite nation of the Beni Ghassan, which held the marches for the Roman Empire along the Hauran harrahs and m the Belqa, just as the Ghassanids had stepped into the place of the Nabataeans and tribes of the Safah, whose Aramaic dialects, attested by countless graffiti, link them with the civilization of Eastern Arabia and the frontiers of Mesopotamia. It is conceivable that the legendary origin of the 'Ajarmah from an Eastern ancestor may have some real foundation in history, and that they may be connected with strata of culture long since submerged by later migrations, which go back to the last centuries before the Christian era. The SIRHAN, now a small tribe scattered over the Belqa, the Jordan valley, and the Southern Hauran hills, are reckoned to be of the best Northern Arab blood, though they have fallen to low estate. They owned the whole of the Wadi Sirhan, which is named after them and were ejected from it by the Anazah. They are now sheep-breeders, like the lest of the Ghawamah, and reduced to small numbers.

They are noted robbers, cruel, faithless, and intractable. Since the establishment of a Turkish Mutesarrif at Kerak and a Kaimmakam at Shobak, they have been reduced to some sort of order; but in the autumn of 1910 the Majallyah of Kerak revolted, tore up the Hejaz Railway in several places, killed the employes, held up the trains, and stripped the passengers. They were severely repressed by Sami Pasha, who called all the Bedouins as far as Ma'an to account, including the Huweitat. His energetic action has not yet faded entirely from memory. All the tribes of this group are cultivators and sheep-breeders. Those who have houses in Kerak or Shobak send out their flocks into the desert in spring. The Shobak Arabs exact tribute from the Kerak people. The list here given is taken from Jaussen, who explains that the word house, used as a unit in his computation, implies the patriarchal family, including the married sons with their wives and families.

There are said to be twenty-one clans of this descent scattered over Arabia, of which fifteen live wholly or in part in Hejaz or North-west Asir, and chiefly in and near Mecca. For the most part numerically small, they derive importance from the consideration which their individual members enjoy throughout Arabia. Theoretically, the Emirs (Grand Sherifs) of Mecca might be chosen from any clan of the Ashraf; but, in fact, they have belonged to one or another branch of the descendants of Abu Numej (who was of the Qatadah stock) for so m any generations, that nowadays succession to this office is, in practice, as much confined by prescription to only two or three clans, as the Sultanate of Turkey is to the House of 'Othman. The mutual affinities, the interconnexion, and the present condition of the Ashraf clans, are not well known ; and many of them are mere names to us. {a) Ahddilah is the ruling clan at present, being that to which the Emir (Grand Sherif) and his house belong. It is descended from Sherif 'Abdullah, grandson of Mohammed Abu Numej (1631). It was raised to power by Mohammed 'Ali of Egypt in 1827 during his occupation of Hejaz, in place of the Dhawi Zeid, who had held the throne since the latter part of the eighteenth century and also at an earlier epoch. In the earlier eighteenth century the Emirate had been with the Dhawi Barakat. The Abadilah clan of Hejaz is entirely settled, the bulk of it living outside Mecca south of the Jiddah road. Many of its members hold office under the Emir. There is another branch in Asir (see p. 159) and scattered families are found in other parts of Arabia. {b) Dhawi Zeid. The Dhawi Zeid clan, which descends from Zeid, great-great-grandson of Mohammed Abu Numej, is settled in Mecca. The houses of Abd el-Mutallib and Ghalib are of the Dhawi Zeid clan, and there is rivalry and bad feeling between it and the 'Abadilah. The only leading members of the clan who live at Mecca are Sherif Zeid, son of Feisal, a young man of about twenty, and the Sherifah Azza, daughter (?) of Sheiif Aun er-Rafiq. 1 he latter appears to be a woman of considei able character, with a keen interest in politics and some power over the Harb. She is unmarried and about sixty years old. The Dhawi Zeid own a large amount of property in Mecca and Jiddah and possess many slaves.158 (c) Shenabrah. The Shenabrah descend from an eponymous Sherif, Shanbar, not of a ruling house. They are nomadic, and are dealt with on p. 129. (d) Dhawi Surur. The Dhawi Surur are descendants of Sherif Surur, who ruled as Emir in the latter part of the eighteenth century. They are nomadic, and are treated on p. 129. {e) Dhawi Barakdt. The Dhawi Barakat, descendants of Barakat, third son of Mohammed Abu Numej, are no longer in Hejaz proper, where they held the supreme power up to the latter part of the eighteenth century and, at a slightly later period, were robbers in Wadi Fatimah. They are said by Burckhardt to have been exhausted by family wars of succession. They are now found in North-western Asir organized as a tribe (see p. 167). (/) Dhawi Hasan. Descendants of Hasan, second son of Mohammed Abu Numej, are also no longer in Hejaz, but in North-western Asir organized as a tribe (see p. 174). Other Ashiaf clans of Hejaz, e.g. Hirdz, Dhawi l Ahd el-Kerlm, Hurith, Menema, Dhawi Jizdn, Dhawi Judallah, Manddil, Dhawi Ibrahim, and Dhawi ( Amr, are, apparently, not of actual political importance. For the Ja'dfirah of Asir see p. 177. Ashraf are numerous and powerful in Yemen, in the districts of Mareb and Harib, and in Wadyan Dawasir; but, as is natural, they are most conspicuous and best known in Hejaz.159 (B) ASIR 1. 'Ahddilah. One of the twenty-one clans of Ashraf. 1. By far the more important section is that settled in Mecca, on which see previous section. 2. There is a small colony of them which has been settled for many generations in the Beni Qutabah country of the Rijal el-M'a. Their influ ence is local and unimportant. Sherif f Abd ibn 'Abdullah is their leading representative. 3. Another small colony has lived for many years with the Dhawi Barakat, about four hours east of Shakkat el-Yemeniyah. They are allied with the Dhawi Barakat and friendly with the Zobeid. Their chief Sheikh is Sherif Talib ibn Qashn. 2. Beni 'Ahs. The BENI 'ABS inhabit the country between Wadi Habl on the north and Wadis 'Ain and Warith on the south. Their territory extends from the sea to the first foot-hills some 25 miles inland, and is bounded on the north by the Beni Hasan, on the east by Beni Aslam and on the south by the Wa'zat. They are from the people of the north and trace their descent from 'Adnan through 'Abs the son of Ghatafan, the son of Qeis, the son of Mudhar. They say that they originally came from the Hejaz, and after moving south at some unknown period to Beit el- Faqih, they again passed north about 500 years ago till they came to their present territory. There is still a small remnant of the tribe, whose present Sheikh is Sheikh Bekhit, near Beit el-Faqih, immediately to the north of the powerful tribe of Zaranik (Dharaniq). The northern 'Abs can put into the field about 3,000 good fighting men well armed with Mausers and Martinis, and are enthusiastic adherents of Idrisi. In 1915 Yahya 'Ali ibn Thawab, their paramount Sheikh, was joint Commander of Idrlsi's second army opposed to the Turkish forces near Loheia. W ith Hadi ibn Ahmed el-Heij the chief of the \\ a'zat and the main local supporter of the Turks, the 'Abs have a long-standing feud. Between them and the Beni Aslam there is an enmity which leads to frequent fighting when the rest of the world is at peace, but which is laid aside when the interests of their common lord, Idrisi, demand. With the Beni Zeid, who are the allies of the Beni Aslam, their relations are the same. They stand to the Beni Hasan as protectors and friends and range freely over their country up to \\ adi Heiran. They are partly nomad and partly settled and trading, and though less in number than the Wa zat they are richer. They sow enough grain for their needs and trade with the tribesmen from the hills, taking from them skins160 and coffee, and selling to them articles of clothing and the like which in times of peace they bring from Loheia and Hodeidah. T heir two chief villages are Suq el-Himari and Siiq 'Abs, where every Friday and Sunday respectively are held markets to which the neighbouring tribesmen come. Sheikh Yahya ibn 'Ali Thawab is responsible that peace is kept at Suq el-Himari. The Sheikhs of the Qutabah and Bitariyah see to the security of Suq 'Abs.

The 'ALQAM EL-HUL occupy a narrow strip of country beginning about 2 miles north of Ibha and running out to the west for about 20 miles. The Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah adjoin them on the north, the Beni Malik on the east, the Beni Mugheid on the south, and the Rijal el-M'a on the west. They are divided into two sections, 'Alqam es-Sahil near Ibha and 'Alqam el-'Alein to the west. Each of these numbers about 2,000 men. The chief Sheikh of the 'Alqam es-Sahil is Ahmed ibn Hamid, a prosperous man of about 45, who is a member of the ' Town Council' at Ibha. The 'Al Yusuf are noted for the beauty of their women, many of whom are married to Turks. The 'Alqam el-'Alein are not on good terms with the 'Alqam es-Sahil, and their Sheikh Abu Matir, a man of 65, is said to have pro-Idrisi tendencies. Ihe tribe is, however, thoroughly undci the control of the Turks and pays its taxes regularly. It is generally on bad terms with the Beni Malik and Beni Mugheid, although there can be no actual fighting, and is friendly with the Rabl'ah wa Rufeidah, the Beni Qeis and the Beni Zeidin sections of the Kijal el-M a. It has a good reputation for bravery. It traces its descent to Qahtan. [a) 'Alqam es-Sahil. Settled. 2,000 men. Paramount Chief : Ahmed ibn Hamid. Chief Muftis : 'Abdullah ibn Hujahri and Ibn 'Abbas. Chief villages :— 'Ain Ibn Musafi Hamarah Umm Makmar Murei Abu Zu. Mushabbab ibn Ta'yin. Nasir ibn Mushabbab.162 5. Bahr Ihn Sekeinah. The BAHR IBN SEKEINAH live along the Muha'il-Birk road from about 9 miles south-west of Muha'il to within 18 miles of Birk, a distance of approximately 29 miles. They are bounded on the north by the Al Musa, on the east first by the Beni Thuwwah and then by the Rijal el-M'a, on the south by the Rijal el-M'a, and on the west by the Beni Hilal. They number 1,000 men of whom 600 are settled and the rest, the Latim and the Makhlutah, nomad. They share with the Beni Hilal the reputation of being one of the most unregenerate and irresponsible tribes of Asir, and the nomads are still Moslems merely in name, though the influence of Idrisi during the past few years has done something to reform them. They have never acknowledged the sway of the Turk nor have the latter been able to subdue them. Their country in the highlands of Asir is thickly forested, abounding in running streams, but only a little has been cleared for cultivation. Their paramount Sheikh is Seyyid Mustafa, a man of 35 years of age, and one of the most prominent figures in Asir. He belongs to a family of Seyyids and not to the tribe itself. In 1912 Idrisi placed him in supreme command of the forces opposing the Turks and the Sherif of Mecca. When the fighting was over the Rijal el-M'a, who will suffer no outsider, complained to Idrisi against his being put over them and even went so far as to try to murder him. He has his own tribesmen thoroughly under control and is looked up to as a stern but just ruler. He is responsible for collecting tribute for Idnsi and, reserving for him self a quarter of all he receives, has grown rich and lives in some state in Jannah. The most serious engagement in the war of 1912 took place at 'Ayadi in his country, resulting in a check for Idrisi. The Bahr Ibn Sekeinah claim kinship with the Rijal el-M'a and are usually on good terms with them. They reckon the Beni Thuwwah amongst their friends but are always at feud with the Beni Hilal and Al Musa. Chief Sheikh : Seyyid Mustafa. Villages : 600 men.

The BALAHMAR live in the rich highland country to the north of163 Ibha, their southern boundary coming to within ten miles of that town. The tribes which adjoin them are on the north the Balasmar, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Beni Malik, and on the est the Rabi ah wa Rufeidah. 1 he tribe is a strong one and numbers about 7,000 men, of whom 4,000 are settled, the rest nomad. Their country is well watered and produces fruits as well as cereals. The paramount Sheikh of the settled portion is 'Abdullah ibn Milhem, a young man of 25, who is liked by the tribe both for his justice and the open house which he keeps. He is a warm supporter of Idrisi and collects taxes for him. Ali ibn Abshan, or'Ali (ihalib Beyasthe 1 urks call him, is the nominal head of all the nomads, but for the last few years he has only had the Al 'Asia under his control. In his younger days he went to Constanti nople and received a military training for five years. On his return to Asir with the rank of Bimbashi he was appointed by the Turks chief tax-collector for the whole district. When Idrisi revolted he stood by the Government but was not supported by the Balahmar who, with the exception of the Al 'Asia, all went over to Idnsi. For the last few years he has lived entirely at Ibha, fearing to go back to his country. He had a house in the village of Malaha in the Beni Malik district which was razed to the ground a few years ago by Seyyid Mustafa of the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah, the chief general of Idrisi in Asir. His son 'Ali was one of the first to be chosen to sit in the Ottoman parliament, but on his return from Constantinople was captured between Qunfudah and Ibha by Idrisi's men and died in captivity at Sabia about six years ago. 'Ali ibn 'Abshan himself is now about 55 years of age and is said to be brave and capable. The Balahmar say that they are descended from the Rijal el-Hajar; but they are probably from some other stock, since they are fairer than other Arabs and most of them have red hair which they wear short, and light eyelashes. 1 he villagers have a reputation for cowardice, but the nomads are stout fighters. The whole tribe, however, has an evil name for treachery and theft and are known amongst other tribes as ' Kilab en-Na'al', intimating that, as a dog in the night, they will steal the shoes from their sleeping guests. The Balahmar are friends with the Balasmar, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, and Beni Malik, but are enemies of the Shahran. (a) Settled. 4,000 men. Paramount Sheikh : 'Abdullah ibn Milhem.

Chief divisions are :— The BAL'ARYAN or ' Sons of nakedness' have received their name from the poor and savage conditions under which they live. They appear to be mostly of African extraction and, save for a few miserable villages, they are nomads. Their exact boundaries have not been ascertained, but it is known that they have the Ghamid on the north, the Bulqarn et-Tihamah on their east, the Beni Shihir on their south, and the Zobeid on their west. They are divided into four sections, the Bal'aryan, the Beni Tsa, Beni Suleim and Beni Suheim, and are said to number 6,000 men. In normal times they quarrel amongst themselves, but unite when danger from outside threatens. They reckon all their neighbours as foes, but have been known to help the Shamran against the Ghamid. The Beni 'Isa pay a nominal allegi ance to Idrisi, which means that they help him in war if there is a prospect of loot, and in peace refuse to pay him taxes. The other sub-tribes are completely independent and refuse to recognize the authority of any one. There are many of these tribesmen scattered all over the country as far as Muha'il and Birk, plying the trade of butchers. Although respected for their bravery, they are despised by all true Arabs for their mixed blood, and their lack of religion which almost amounts to paganism. Sub-tribes :— Bal'aryan, 2,500 men, mostly nomad. Beni Tsa, 1,200 men, mostly settled. Beni Suleim, 2,000 men, mostly nomad Beni Suheim, 600 men, mostly nomad. The BALASMAR are a strong tribe, reported to number some 9,000 men, and situated due east of Muha'il from which they are divided by the Reish. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Shihir on the north, the Shahran on the east, the Balahmar on the south, and the Reish on the west. They are said to be descended from the Rijal el-Hajar, and are of the same stock as the Beni Shihir. They dwell on the fertile slopes of the Al 'Asia Bahashah Beni Tha'labah Himri. 'Abdullah Ferthan. Safar ibn Duh. 7. Bal'arydn. 8. Balasmar.165 hills and up to the long ascent known as the Aqabah Sajein to the top of the main ridge of Asir, and are known accordingly as people of the mountains or people of the Tihamah. Much coffee is grown on the hill terraces, and wheat and other cereals round the villages. Jebel Hada is the chief centre of the tribe and the most productive. The Ibha-Ta'if road runs through their territory for about seven miles between Madfa'ah and Tanumah. The paramount Sheikh of the whole tribe is 'Ali ibn Mohammed, a man of 50, tall and powerful, with a scar over the right eyebrow. He lives at Madfa'ah and is a firm adherent of Idrisi, as are the rest of the tribe. Idrisi takes taxes from them. In former days Turkish influence reached them, but since Idrisi's rise to power they have been left alone. The Balasmar are friendly with the Balahmar and the Beni Shihir ; with the Reish and Shahran they are at enmity. Their reputation for hospitality and prowess in war is good. 'Ali ibn Ra'ih is the mufti of the tribe, a dark-skinned man of about 55 with a long flowing beard. He is said to have Turkish leanings, and is on bad terms with 'Ali ibn Mohammed, but he is sound in his judgements and generous, and is liked by the tribe. Paramount Sheikh : 'Ali ibn Mohammed, of Madfa'ah. 9,000 men. (а) Ahl el-Jihal. 4,000 men. Chief villages are :— Sadwan 'Ali ibn Hasan. Hudhwah Yahya ibn 'Allamah. Al Ikhrein ' Mohammed ibn Sadiq.

Khamis Makhadah Zaban Abu Sudr. Umm Hajju Ghurmallah. Ahl Suq el-Ithnein 'Ali ibn Shehab. Hadar Barakat ibn Husein. 9. Ahl Barak. The four tribes of HUMEIDAH, AL MUSA IBN 'ALI, AL ISBAT, and AL JEBALI are known collectively in Asir as the AHL BARAK, and it will therefore be convenient to class them together, although they do not form a confederation or trace their descent to the same ancestors. The district of Barak begins about 15 miles north of Muhail, and covers an area of about 20 miles from north to south and 30 miles from east to west. It is a fertile country with plentiful rains and is largely cultivated, simsim being the principal crop. It is bounded on the north and east by166 the Beni Shihir, on the south by the Reish, Al Dureib, and Rabi'at et- Tahahin, and on the west by the Rabl'ah Mujatirah. The most important tribe is the Humeidah, numbering 7,000 men, of whom 4,000 are nomads. They occupy the western part of the district, and the Muha'il-Qunfudah road from Dhahab to Ghar el-Hindi is in their territory. They quarrel with the Al Isba'i and are divided amongst themselves, the villagers favouring the Turks, the nomads Idrisi. Mohammed ibn Hayazah is their Sheikh, and the paramount Sheikh of the whole district by the nomination of Idrisi. He is a man of about 45, and has the reputation of using his position with wisdom and moderation. The Al Musa ibn 'Ali occupy the south-eastern portion of the district along the first stages of the Barak-Tanumah road, and number about 3,000 men. They are entirely sedentary and agricultural, and disagree with the Al Jebali. They are friendly with the Reish and the pro-Idrisi section of the Al Musa. The Al Isba'i are between the Al Musa ibn 'Ali and the Humeidah and north of the Al Jebali. Both the Al Isba'i and Al Jebali are entirely settled in villages. Taken as a whole the tribes support Idrisi, with the exception of the settled Humeidah, and pay him taxes. They are peaceful and pleasure- loving, and by no means fond of war. At the same time they are not above harrying small Turkish convoys. The road from Muha'il to Qun- fudah, however, is so beset with unfriendly tribes that the Turks seldom pass over it except in numbers sufficiently large to repel any ordinary attack. Humeidah.

The DHAWI BARAKAT are one of the tribes of Ashraf related to the Qoreish, They occupy a barren stretch of the sea-coast from Shakkat esh-Shamiyah to about 25 miles south and extend inland for about 14 miles. The Wadi Dokhah runs through their country and provides water for their annual crop of dukhn and dhura. They number only 400 men, but make up for their paucity of numbers by their reckless daring. Coastal dhows give their shores a wide berth, for they live chiefly on what they can make by piracy, and in their swift vessels take toll of all who come their way. Their chief is Sherif Hasan Abu Mandil, a man about 45 years old, who recognizes the authority of neither the Sherif, the Turks, nor Idrisi. His right-hand man and the one most noted in raiding is Sherif Mohammed ibn Sa'idah. They maintain a perpetual feud with their piratical rivals the Dhawi Hasan, but are on friendly terms with the Zahran, their eastern neigh bours, and with the Zobeid to their south. There is a small colony of 'Abadilah Ashraf in their country, which is allied to them. An offshoot of the tribe lives at Manadil in the Bela'ir country. Paramount Sheikh : Sherif Hasan Abu Mandil. 400 men. Clans :— Manadil Sherif Zein ibn Qasim. Hawatimah Sherif Hashim ibn 'Ubeid. Ruwajihah Sherif Dahshan ibn Khudherr.

The BELATR are a strong and truculent tribe inhabiting the country from between Khabt el-'Umr and Juma'ah Rabi'ah to Habil and Joz Bela'ir, on the Qunfudah-Barak road. They are bounded on the north and north-east by the Zobeid, east by the Rabi'ah Mujatirah, south-east by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin, south by the Aulad el-'Alaunah, and west by the Marahibah section of the Beni Zeid. Hayazah ibn Hasan. 1,500 men. Zaban. Milbis. Ibn Umm 'Ariyah. Sa'id Mohammed ibn Nebyah (well-known merchant). Hawash. 800 men.168 They are divided into two main divisions, the Nawashirah, 3,000 men, and the 'Umr, 4,000, the former partly settled, the latter entirely nomad, and ranging the country to the south of their borders. Iheir situation astride the two main roads from Qunfudah to Muha'il is an excellent one for raiding, and they take full advantage of it.. They hate the Turks, who can only pass through their country in force. The chief Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Medini, a man of 50, who was formerly paramount Sheikh of the whole tribe. He was bought over by the Sherif of Mecca in 1912, and his desertion of Idrisi lost him the support of all the 'Umr and of the Nawashirah with the exceptions of the Firshah and Sa'dah clans, and the inhabitants of the village of Joz Bela'ir. The tribe is still split in two, and Sheikh Ibn Kheirah of the Nawashirah has gathered most of the power into his hands, and is reckoned amongst the Idrisi adherents. Their country includes both plain and hills, and is rich enough to give pasture for large herds of camels, goats, and cattle, and to grow cereals in the rainy season. They are allied with the Zobeid, but are generally at loggerheads with their other neighbours. The most extreme section and the one most feared by travellers is a colony of about 300 of the Dhawi Barakat called the Ashraf Manadil, living at Manadil, just to the west of J 6z Bela'ir on the main road to Qunfudah. They have lived there for many years and have severed all connexion with their parent tribe, but they have retained the tribal reputation for lawlessness. Their chief is Sherif Abu Talib, who pays allegiance to 'Ali ibn Medini. The colony, however, keeps to itself and does not intermarry with the Bela'ir nor does it adopt the local custom of allowing its women to go unveiled. The Bela'ir Arabs are lax in their marriage customs, but they do not marry outside their own tribe. Although truculent and quarrelsome, they have a reputation for clean fighting, and are hospitable to those with whom they are not at feud.

The BULQARN arc divided into the Bulqarn es-Serrah and the Bulqarn et-Tihamah, and stretch in a south-westerly direction from near Blshah across the tangled mass of mountains which form the backbone of the Asir range, and down towards the seaward slopes. They are bounded on the north by the Shamran and Khath'am, on the east by the Shahran and nomads of Beni Shihir, on the south by the Beni 'Amr and Beni Shihir, and on the west by the Bal'aryan and Ghamid. The Bulqarn es-Serrah are two-thirds settled and one-third nomad, the Sheikh over all being Mash'ad ibn Bahran, who lives at 'Alayah, a large village about eight hours west of Qal'at Blshah. He is a rich landowner, and also possesses date-groves in Blshah. The country appears to be fertile and well wooded, and supports large herds of camels, goats, and cattle. The nomads draw in to the cultivation during its season, and when it has been harvested take flour to Blshah, which they exchange for dates. There is a general truce with the Shahran amongst all the tribes during the date season at Bishah, which lasts about four months. At other times the Bulqarn are at feud with the Shahran, Beni Shihir, Ghamid, and Shamran. They are friendly to the Khath'am and Beni 'Amr. The Bulqarn el-Yemen occupy the lowland district of 'Urdiyah and are wholly given up to farming. Their chief Sheikh is Mujarri ibn Sa'id. The two sections of the tribe are friendly, and help each other in war. They are not remarkable for their courage, but can render a good account of themselves. In politics they all favour Idrisi and pay him taxes. They are hospitable in character, and passage through their country is generally safe. A. Bulqarn esh-Sham or es-Serrah, 6,000 men.

Y170 Clans :— Al esh-Sha'eir. Al Shahbah. Beni Tala'. Al el-Mudeifir. Al Mizhim. 13. Al ed-Dureib. The AL ED-DUREIB are a small tribe numbering some 800 men, to the north-west of Muha'il. They occupy about ten miles of the Sikkat el- Helawiyah from Muha'il to Qunfudah between the villages of Turqush and Ma'mal Ikhleif, and stretch up along the Barak road for about five miles north of Musabbah, which is in their territory. They are bounded on the north by the Al Musa, west by the Reish, south-east by the Al Musa, south by the Beni Hilal, and west by the Rabi'at et-Tahahln. They are a good fighting race, but are not naturally quarrelsome or bellicose. Idrisi, however, frequently incites them to cut Turkish communica tions. Their country is fertile, and they possess many flocks and herds. The Al Musa and Rabi'at et-Tahahin are friendly to them, the Al Jebali, Reish, and Beni Hilal as a rule inimical. They have the reputation of being hospitable beyond the ordinary, and travellers can journey without fear in their country. There is a small offshoot of their nomad sub-section, the Al Ikhleif, situated in the Rabi'ah Mujatirah country near Ghar el-Hindi, who have cut themselves adrift from the main tribe. Mohammed ibn 'Amr Akhu 'Abdiyah, a man of 35, is the chief Sheikh. He has been to Mecca several times, and frequently goes to Sabia. During his absence the tribe is governed by his sister 'Abdiyah, who married a Turkish officer, now dead, named 'Ali Bey Rida. Chief Sheikh : Mohammed ibn 'Amr Akhu 'Abdiyah. 800 men. Villages :— Turqush Musabbah Juzan Wadi Musabbah Wadi el-Ushir Rahah 'Ain ed-Dureib Nomads :— Al Ikhleif. 14. Ghdmid. The GHAMID own a wide stretch of territory in the highlands of southern Hejaz and northern Asir, roughly from latitude iq^o' to ao 0 ;^ and longitude 41 0 30' to 42 0 . The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north the Shalawah, east Shamran, south Bulqarn and Bal'aryan, and west Mohammed ibn el-'Allamah. Mohammed ibn Hedeyyah. Rajih. Mushatir. Ma'addi. Mohammed ibn Barud. Mohammed ibn Kheir.171 Zobeid and Zahran. It is difficult to estimate their numbers, reports varying from Burckhardt's estimate of 5,000 to 10,000 fighting men, to a native estimate of 60,000 men. The first is probably as wrong as the last, but there seems no doubt that they are considerably more numerous than any of their neighbours. The inland road from Ibha to Ta'if runs through the midst of their country, which is well watered and fertile. The tribe is divided into two portions, the nomad and settled, who are always at odds with one another. The nomads are Al Seyah, a tall race of fine fighters who live to the north of the settled portion and roam far afield to the Shalawah country round Turabah, to Ranyah, Tathlith, and Wadi Dawasir. They are rich in horses, camels, and goats, and recognize no authority. Their chief is Mohammed ibn 'Abd er-Rahman, a man of about 45, and a noted warrior. He is entirely independent of outside influences. The chief of the settled Arabs is 'Aziz ibn Musheit, a young man of 25 years of age, who follows the Sherif of Mecca and frequently visits him. He is at enmity with Mohammed ibn 'Abd er-Rahman. A large number of his men go yearly to Mecca, Jiddah, and Ta'if, and act as porters during the pilgrim season. They remain there for about four months, and return with supplies for the rest of the year. Many invest their savings in rifles, which they buy at one of the two chief markets, Ru'eis near Jiddah or Nuzulah Beni Malik. They also buy rifles from the Rijal el-M'a. Although not noted for their fighting skill they yet are frequently at war, their chief foes being the Zahran, and after them the Bal'aryan, Bulqarn, Shamran, and Shahran. Even the Al Seyah, who are the better fighters, combine with them when trouble with the Zahran arises. Their friends are the Zobeid and Beni Malik of Hejaz. Their women occupy a much more important position than in most tribes, and take an equal share in all harder forms of manual labour, and even have a say in the tribal councils. The tribe is still nicknamed the Khadimln ed-Derwishah, after a woman who died about fifty years ago, having ruled them for nearly 40 years. The women also weave earners- hair garments and blankets. Owing to the annual migration to the Hajj, the tribe is more civilized than most and has a good reputation for hos pitality. In May 1915, some of their Sheikhs, whose names are not known, wrote to Idrisi proposing to join him. Idrisi advised them to keep quiet until a more favourable moment arrived, but sent a Qadhi to collect money from them. At the beginning of 1916 he was still in com munication with them. A man of importance in the tribe is Salih ibn 'Ajalah. He is the richest merchant, and controls most of the trade between Mecca and the Ghamid. The export of tobacco, of which a considerable amount is grown, is entirely in his hands. Another man of influence is Mohammed ibn 'Ali of the Beni Kebir. He was chosen as one of the representatives of Asir in the Ottoman Y 2173 Bela'ir. Thence it goes south-east for about ten miles along the Rabi'at et- Tahahin and Beni Dhi'b territory to Kiyad, which is 21 miles NE. of Hali. Here it reaches the Beni Hilal and follows their line towards the coast, which it touches about 12 miles south of Hali. The four tribes are the 'Abid el-Emir, Ghawanimah, Aulad el- 'Alaunah, and Kinanah, who are all settled with the exception of the Salalimah clan of the 'Abid el-Emir and the Fellahah clan of the Aulad el-'Alaunah, both small and unimportant units. The largest tribe is the Aulad el-'Alaunah, who number 3,000 men and are strung out along the Juma'ah Rabi'ah road from Kidwah to Minj iyah. Next in importance are the Ghawanimah (1,500) from Radha to Kha'i along the Muha'il road ; then the Kinanah from the Beni Hilal to Minjlyah, and finally the 'Abid el-Emir (600 men) on the Beni Dhi'b frontier. The paramount Sheikh over all is Ibn 'Aji, a man of about 55, who in the past was a friend of the Turks, but seceded to Idrisi when the latter began to grow powerful. The Turks used to occupy Hali, but they were driven out sixteen years ago, and have been unable to regain a footing. The confederation is a rich one, having sufficient water for its agricultural needs and possessing large herds of cattle. They are noted warriors, and maintain feuds with all their neighbours. The Rijal el-M'a are the only tribe which they regard with friendly eyes. Their relations towards each other are at times strained, but they unite for common defence and when Idnsi calls them out. The 'Abid el-Emir were originally slaves of Sudanese stock, but have long since gained their emancipation and now rank on an equality with the Arabs. A number of them go every year on the pilgrimage to Mecca, where they have an evil reputation for robbery and theft. The Kinanah are an ancient and famous tribe, who probably came into being about a. d. 100, and are descended from the Mudhar branch of Nizar. The Qoreish are a branch of them. They were at first settled near Mecca, and took a prominent part against Mohammed the Prophet, by whom they were subdued. When Africa was invaded part of the tribe went to the Sudan, where they are still found in Kordofan, while others went to Egypt and from there pushed as far west as Morocco. The Arabian remnant had meantime taken up their residence near Hali, where they were reported to be by Ibn Batutah in 1353. Some severe fighting took place in the Hali country during the cam paign with the Sherif of Mecca and theTurks in 1910, in which the Ahl Hali, who were fighting for Idrisi, gave a good account of themselves.

The DHAWI HASAN occupy the coast-line from just north of Lith down to Shakkat esh-Shamiyah, a distance of about 45 miles, and inland to the beginning of the mountains, which are here only a few miles from the sea. They are of Sherilial stock and connected with the Qoreish, but they do not reflect credit on the tribe, for they pay small attention to religion and concentrate all their energies on piracy, being the most notorious band of freebooters and sea-robbers along the whole coast. The Turks ha\ e a garrison about two hours inland from their main post at Lith, and exercise a certain restraint over them; but the Dhawi Hasan hate both the 1 urks and the Sherif, and what little deference they show to any one is paid to Idrlsi, who is sufficiently far away to be attractive.175 Sherif Mustur represents the Sherif at Lith, and collects a certain amount of taxes. I he chief of the tribe is Sherif Mohammed ibn Hasan ibn el-'Aud, whose name is known with dread by every sailor along the coast. Almost equally feared are his followers, Sherif Isma'il Abu Khurfan, Sherif Rajib ibn Dajhid, and Murzut ibn Bakhit, a Sudanese slave who won his freedom by his skill in raiding. They are friendly with the Zahran and Juhadlah, their eastern and northern neighbours, but have a long-standing feud with the Dhawi Barakat, who lie to their south. The Dhawi Hasan possess many slaves, and the cruelty with which they are treated is notorious in the Hejaz. Blacks captured at sea are invariably enslaved and hamstrung to minimize their chance of escape. Chief Sheikh : Sherif Mohammed ibn Hasan ibn el-'Aud. 3,000 men. Al Asaf Sherif Hasan ibn Husein Khumjan Sherif Mahjub ibn Barakat Al Hasan ibn Ahmed Sherif Haza' ibn Fuzan Al Jisas Sherif Bureik ibn Ahmed 17. Beni Hasan. The BENI HASAN inhabit the country between Wadis Heiran and Habil from the sea to about 20 miles inland, and are bounded on the north by the Beni Marwan, on the south by the Beni 'Abs, and on the east by the Beni Zeid. They are firm friends of the Beni 'Abs, who protect them and range over their country, and they keep on good terms both with the Beni Zeid, whom they fear, and with the Beni Marwan. In number about 2,000 souls, they can put 500 fighting men into the field. Manjur is their chief village, about 20 miles ESE. of Midi; Hasan es-Sa'id and Musa Hasan are their chief Sheikhs. 18. Beni Hildl. The BENI HILAL occupy a broad expanse of country stretching from the Sikkat esh-Sheraf between Hali and Muha'il to Birk on the sea-shore. Their exact boundary starts at Sabt es-Sawalah, about 23 miles from Hali, and runs just north of the Sikkat esh-Sheraf andWadi Dofa' up to within 4 miles of Muha'il, a total distance of about 34 miles. On the north they are bounded by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin and Al ed-Dureib. From Sirr the boundary goes south-west to Birk, marching first with the Al Musa, and finally, near the coast, with the Munjahah. The coast is theirs for about 18 miles north of Birk, and then the boundary goes inland and so up to Sabt es-Sawalah along the Hali border. The country is densely wooded, and provides pasturage for large herds of camels and goats. The tribe is divided into the Ahl Birk, the Al Ikhtarsh (who live in the direction of Muha'il, and are subdivided into the Al Misjar and Al Umm J am'ah), and the Arabs of the western parts whose subdivisions have not176 been ascertained. The Al Ikhtarsh are said to number 5,000 men, and the remainder, including the Ahl Birk, 7,000. The Ahl Birk and the Arabs inhabiting the villages along the sea coast, such as Xakhl el-Biik, Xahud, and Sobakhah, form the only re spectable portion of the tribe. They cultivate a little, grow date-trees in some of the villages, and supplement this by collecting salt near Birk, which they sell to the neighbouring tribes. Mohammed ibn 'Abdu is the chief Sheikh, a man of 35 years of age and a staunch adherent of Idrisi. He is nominal chief over the whole tribe, and does in fact have considerable influence over it. But to keep it entirely in check is almost an impossibility, for it has the well-earned reputation of being one of the wildest and most intractable tribes of the Asir. Almost pagan, the Hilal lead an entirely nomadic life, subsisting on meat and milk and buying what little they need from outside. They have closed the Sikkat esh-Sheraf to the Turks, who are obliged to travel by the more northern roads, the Sikkat el-Helawiyah or the Barak road, and even ordinary travellers do not dare to pass through their country except in large armed parties. As far as they may be said to have any politics, they are pro-Idrisi, but they are much too out of hand to be of value as allies. They are at daggers drawn with all the neighbouring tribes with the exception of the Rijal el-M'a, whose hand they fear. Ali ibn 'Abdu, the Sheikh of Birk, was recently reported to be in the pay of the Turks, and to be smuggling mails up to Ibha, but the well- known attitude of the tribe renders this improbable. In 1910 the Sherif tried to suborn him with the offer of £3,000. 'Ali ibn 'Abdu's only reply was to send him a Mauser cartridge. Mohammed ibn Hasan, chief of the Al Ikhtarsh, is a notorious highwayman, and has a most unsavoury reputation for treachery and cunning. 1. Ahl Birk. Chief Sheikh: Mohammed ibn 'Abdu, of Birk. Other prominent Sheikhs : 'Ali ibn 'Abdu (Sheikh of Birk). 'Ali ibn Muqdi (merchant). Sha'ban Mohammed ibn Fayy. 2. Western Arabs. 3. Al Ikhtarsh. Mohammed ibn Hasan. Al Misjar. Al Umm Jam'ah. 19. Ja'dah. A small Sunni tribe between the Beni Marwan and Masarihah just south of Wadi Ta'shar, about 10 miles north of Midi. Their chief Sheikhs are Mohammed Ahmed and Sheikh Maqbul, both of whom have been fighting for Idrisi.177 20. Ja'dfirah. One of the 21 tribes of Ashraf. They are settled in and round Joz el-Ja'afirah to the north of Jeizan. Sherif Mohammed 'Ali is their chief Sheikh. He is said to be secretly disaffected to Idrisi but openly is on good terms with him. The tribe numbers about 600 men. 21. Khamisln. A tribe, rather smaller than the Beni 'Abs, inhabiting the hills east of Haradh. They are allies of their western neighbours, the Beni Marwan, and adherents of Idrisi. Their chief village is Suq el-Mughasil, where a market is held every Sunday. 22. KhatKam. The KHATH'AM are a small settled tribe on the Ibha-Ta'if road, with the Shamran to their north and west and the Bulqarn to their east and south. They do not muster more than 1,500 men, and are partly nomadic. The chief village of the settled portion is Lasfar, where lives their chief Sheikh, Juheish ibn 'Aqad, an old man of 60. The nomads are camel owners, and are almost all engaged in the carrying trade to Bishah and Namas. They excel in fighting, and are allied with the Bulqarn and Shamran. Their chief menace comes from the Ghamid, and the Khath'am, Bulqarn, Beni 'Amr, and Shamran all unite against that powerful tribe when it threatens any one of them. In politics they favour Idrisi. The tribe traces its descent back to the Rijal el-Hajar. Paramount Sheikh : Juheish ibn 'Aqad, of Lasfar. [a) Settled sections :— A1 Murrah Thawab ibn Nasir. Al Serdan Mohammed ibn 'Alam. (h) Nomad sections :— Mazariqah Juheish ibn 'Aqad. Al S elm an Shuweib ibn Mohammed. 23. Beni Malik. The BENI MALIK live to the north of Ibha, their southern boundary being only 2 miles away. The adjoining tribes are, on the north the Balahmar, east the Shahran, south the Beni Mugheid, and west the ' Alqam el-Hul and Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah. They are of Qahtan stock, and with the Beni Mugheid, Rufeidat el-Yemen, and 'Alqam el-Hul form what is strictly speaking Asir. Ihe tribe numbers about 5,000 men of whom 2,000 are nomads. The villagers are under Sheikh 'Ali ibn Ma'addi, and are divided into the three chief clans of Al el-Mujemmil, Beni Rizam, and Beni Rabi ah. They are Turkish in sympathy with the exception of the Beni Rizam, whose Sheikh, Tahir Abu Hashar, was imprisoned for a year at Ibha for A. Z179 4. Other villages.

A Sunni tribe numbering about 1 ,000 fighting men and inhabiting the country from Wadi Heiran on the south almost to Wadi Ta'ashar on the north. They are bounded on the north by the Masarihah, on the east by the Ahl Haradh and Khamisln, and on the south by the Bern Hasan. The port of Midi is in their country, and their chief village is Suq el-Kairan. Formerly they were partisans of Idrisi, but they rebelled against him when he accepted help from the Italians. They are evidently still disloyal, for Idrisi is reported to have sent a puni tive expedition against Ibn Bakri, their chief Sheikh, in November 1915. Sheikh Tahir 'Ali is the Sheikh of Midi. 25. Masdrihah. A Sunni tribe supporting Idrisi, who occupy the country from Wadi Ta'shar almost up to Abu 'Arlsh and Jeizan on the north and east to the first foothills. They are bounded on the north by the Reish, on the south by the Ja'dah and Beni Marwan, and on the east by the Beni Mohammed. Their chief village is Samtah, and they are said to muster 1 ,000 fighting men. The chief Sheikhs are Ahmed Masawah, 'Othman Siwadi, Abu Halim, and \ ahya Mihah. 26. Beni Mohammed. A tribe east of the Masarihah in the hills south-east of Jeizan. They support Idrisi. 27. Beni Mugheid. The BENI MUGHEID are a fine fighting tribe dwelling in the steep hill country which leads up to Ibha from the south and in and around Ibha itself. The adjoining tribes are, on the north the 'Alqam el-Hul and Beni Malik, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Sha af Rashah and Al Yinfa'ah sections of the Shahran and the Rabl'at el-Yemen, and on the west the Rijal el-M'a. z 2180 Their southern limit is the Wadi Shahlah, which flows into the Wadi Dhilah (or DhiPa) at Heidat et-Tihamiyah. The tribe numbers about 7,000 men, of whom more than 5,000 are firm adherents of the lurks, and as their fortresses are practically impregnable in Arab warfare, they are a valuable asset to the Ottoman Government. The tribe is divided into seven divisions, the Al Yazid, Al Najih, Al el-Wazi, Al Umm Sheraf, Al Umm Jerei'at, Al Umm Wadi Malah, and Al Weiman. Their country is fertile, with running streams, and produces coffee and fruits. The Al Yazid are the ruling clan, and are subdivided into the families of Ibn Mufarrih, Al Abu Sarah, and Aulad el-Emir Mohammed ibn 'A'idh, who ruled supreme over all Asir before the days of the lurks and Idrisi. Idrisi's rise to power has split up many a tribe in Asir which was formerly united, and the Al Yazid have not escaped the general feeling of discord. The head of the Aulad el-Emir Mohammed ibn 'A'idh is Hasan ibn 'Ali, a young man of 26, who has already distinguished himself in battle. He was at one time with Idrisi, but in 1910 was bribed by the Sherif of Mecca and seceded to the Turks, who made him Vali of Asir, which strictly speaking only includes the tribes of Beni Malik, 'Alqam, Rufeidat el-Yemen, and Beni Mugheid, who are all descended from Qahtan, but it is used loosely to include all the tribes from Wada'ah to Zahran. In practice Hasan only rules those tribes which recognize Turkish authority. The Turks, as is their custom with local chiefs whom they wish to keep in good humour, have made him a Bey. His own house is divided against him, for while his cousins Nasir and Mohammed ibn 'Abd er-Rahman support him and occupy positions under the Turks, the rest of his family, including his brother 'Ali, a young man of 20, have Idrisi sympathies and refuse to countenance the Government. Ihe family lives at Reidah and Harmalah, about 15 miles to the south-west of Ibha, Hasan ibn 'Ali himself occupying the strong fortress of Qasr 'Ali ibn Mohammed. The Aulad ibn Mufarrih live at Sijah, three miles north of Reidah, and are descendants of Sheikh Mufarrih, who ruled over Asir until he was ousted by the house of 'A'idh. On this account there has always been ill- feeling between the two families, which has developed into open hatred in the present generation owing to the murder of Ahmed ibn Mufarrih, father of 'Abdullah ibn Mufarrih, by the father of Hasan ibn 'Ali, some years ago. The Aulad ibn Mufarrih rebelled against the Turks when Idrisi arose, and under 'Abdullah ibn Mughethil defeated a force sent against them. 'Abdullah ibn Mufarrih is their chief, a man of 45, who holds the title of Bey from the Turks, and, on account of his large estate and his landed property in Ibha, is outwardly on good terms with them, but secretly in communication with Idrisi. Of the Al Abu Sarah, whose head-quarters are at Dhohyah, just to the181 north of Sijah, 'Ali ibn Lahik and his son Husein were formerly with the Turks, but have seceded and allied themselves with the 'Aulad ibn Mufarrih. Mohammed Abu Dusah has long been a noted opponent of the Turks. The Al Najih are just to the west of Ibha and are divided in their sympathy. Their Sheikh, Yahya ibn Sallm, was taken captive and imprisoned by Idrlsi five years ago for refusing to pay taxes to him. The Al el-Wazi live near the 'Alqam el-Hiil boundary, and are especially noted for their bravery, which has earned their nickname of Turk el-'Arab. They are all pro-Turk. The Al Umm Sheraf are all settled along the Al Sirhan (Shahran) boundary and are entirely out of hand, being at open enmity with the Turks and all their neighbours, as well as their own tribe. Their country is the focus of all the thieves and highwaymen of the district, and they continually hold up the roads and rob innocent travellers. They also go up to the Wadi Tayyah in the Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah district, and help the Al Harith in their war against society. The most notorious amongst them are 'Abdullah ibn Mifdhil, Nasir and Musa ibn Sherein, and Gharam ibn Rabih. The Al Umm Jerei'at and Al Umm Wadi Malah are both settled in and round Ibha, and are with the Government. The Al Weiman, a small section of 400 men who live near the Rabfah border to the south, are under the influence of Idrisi. The Beni Mugheid are not a quarrelsome race, and live at peace with all their neighbours, except the Rijal el-M'a, with whom they have a hereditary feud. They take a considerable part in the local government, occupying many of the smaller posts, such as clerkships and the like, and a few have been chosen to represent Asir in the Ottoman Pailiament. Amongst these are Ahmed ibn Umm Shibah of the Al Umm Mufarrih, a man of 50, fat, dark, and of average height. He is an eloquent speakei, a keen politician, and very pro-lurk, with a stiong hatied of the Sa dah. When at Ibha he sits on the town council. He is a rich landowner, but is unpopular on account of his meanness. 'Ali ibn Khanfur is another deputy, and belongs to the Al Umm Wadi Malah. He belongs to a middle-class family, his people being traders in hides in a small way. He used to be Bashkatib of accounts in Ibha, having worked his way up from a small clerkship. He is a small man of about 40, whose face is pitted with small-pox. He is \ ery intelligent, and used to be religious, but has latterly taken to drink. He is not liked by the tribe. Mohammed ibn 'Aziz, of the Al Umm Manadhir, is another man of importance. He married a sister of Husein Eff. Walad Muzeiqah Julas, a deputy for Asir and the Finance Minister (Sanduq Amini), and is accustomed to act for the latter during his absence abroad. He is also responsible for assessing the taxes in all the lurkish distiicts. A man of 25 years of age, small and dark, he is clever and has a good reputation.184 (g) Al Weiman. 400 men.

The MUNJAHAH occupy the sea-coast and a few miles inland from just south of Birk almost to Shuqaiq, and are bounded on the north by the Beni Hilal, east by the Rijal el-M'a, and south by the tribes of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. They muster about 6,000 men, of whom five-sixths are nomads. The villagers live in the small ports of Wasm, Wahlah, and Khasa'ah. They have a little cultivation and a few date-trees, and eke out their existence by acting as porters in their own villages and at Birk. These places, though small, are important as being the chief inlets for arms and ammunition, a trade which is chiefly in the hands of the Rijal el-M'a. Idrisi stations his port officers at them, but the Rijal el-M'a, who treat with him as equals rather than subjects, refuse to recognize his right to tax them, and he does not press the point. Ihe Munjahah, however, all pay him taxes, Sheikh Hasan Faslkh being deputed to collect them. The nomads are fairly well off in sheep and camels. They are fisher men and sell dried fish in the interior. They also export dom nuts to Musawwa'. Their reputation is very evil, and even their guests sleep with their rifles by their sides. Their solemn oath has no meaning for them, and they are notorious for their treachery. Before Idrisi reduced them to order they were slave-dealers and kidnappers, highwaymen and sea pirates, and used to raid right up to Muha'il and Barak. They do not dare now to commit more than an occasional robbery or murder, for the Idrisi's police are always stationed in their country and punish severely any attempt to return to the old way of living. They are disliked by all the surrounding tribes, but in ordinary times they wander out of their country to the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah and Beni Hilal. They do not go south of Shuqaiq at all, having no wish to come into closer contact with Idrisi than is necessary.185 Their chief Sheikh, 'Ali ibn Fayy, is a man 45 years old, and helps Idrisi to maintain law and order. His house is in Wasm, where he owns considerable property. He has seen much fighting, and always leads his tribe in battle. Chief Sheikh : 'Ali ibn Fayy. 6,000 men. [a) Settled. 1,000 men. Chief villages are :— Qahmah 'A'idh ibn 'Isa. Wasm Mohammed ibn Fayy. Rehasa'ah Mohammed ibn Tali'. Raqabah 'Omar ibn Mohammed. Wahlah Mohammed ibn Gharamah. [b) Nomad ; Mohammed ibn Zeid. 5,000 men. Chief clans are :— A1 Umm Khareis Mohammed ibn Zeid. A1 'Abdlyah. A1 Zeid. Al Umm Hadish. A1 Sariyah. Al esh-Shihbi. Weled Islam. 29. Al Musa. The AL MUSA own the town of Muha'il and the country round within a radius of from 5 to 10 miles. They are mostly settled, but the clans of Umm Jirban and Beni Yazld are nomad. The tribe is a mixed one, the nomads and a few of the townsmen being of pure Arab blood, the rest being blacks, originally of some African strain. No doubt they were at one time slaves, but they have long since earned their emancipation by their courage, and are now on an equality with the Arab portion of the tribe, although no intermarriage takes place. The tribe is fairly rich in flocks and herds, and although their country, w^hich stands comparatively low, cannot rival the fertility of the highlands, it nevertheless pioduccs good crops in the rainy seasons. The enmity between the Turks and Idrisi has disorganized the tribe, and divided it into two opposing factions. Sheikh Suleiman ibn 'Ali, who is by right of inheritance the paramount chief, has thrown in his lot with theTurks, and has behind him theUmm Jirban and about half the villagers. The remainder have broken loose under the leadership of Dhakir ibn Sha'r, and many of them have retired to live at Jannah in the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah country, refusing to stay at Muha'il so long as there is a Turkish post there. From Jannah they carry on a guerilla warfare, closing the roads and cutting off Turkish convoys whenever they can. The tribe is bounded on the north by the Al ed-Dureib and Reish,on the east by the Reish and Beni Thuwwah, on the south by the Beni I huwwah a. a a187 numerous, are of little political importance, since they are poor fighters and there is little cohesion amongst their clans. They earn their living chiefly by selling milk and semn in Sabia. Sheikh Mohammed ibn Musa'i is their chief. The tribe pays taxes regularly to Idrisi. Chief subdivisions are the Beni Mohammed (not connected with the Beni Mohammed farther south), the Hajowi or Haju, and Beni Mufarrih. 31. Beni Nashar. A small tribe in the mountains east of the Wa'zat and to the south of the Beni Aslam. Their chief village is Suq Beni Nashar, where a market is held every Wednesday. They do not number more than 1,000 souls, but afford what help they can to the Beni 'Abs and Idrisi against the Wa'zat. Sheikh Yahya Saghir is the principal Sheikh, others being 'Ali el-Qahm (who was originally with Hadi ibn Ahmed el-Heij of the Wa'zat, but submitted to Idrisi two years ago) and Ahmed Janah. 32. Qahtdn. The Qahtan of Asir are the Rufeidat el-Yemen, Beni Bishr, Senhan el- Hibab, 'Abidah, Wada'ah and Shereif. They are known in Asir generically as the Qahtan, and Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim of the Shereif is Emir over them all by appointment of Idrisi, as was his father by appointment of the Turks; but they are in fact six separate tribes, each living within its own boundaries, having its own particular ambitions, its special likes and dislikes, its peculiar customs, and forming by itself a completely inde pendent unit. Part of the Rufeidat el-Yemen are under Turkish influence. It is only in times of great crisis, as when the Shahran rose in a body against them about a hundred years ago, that they answer to the call of their common blood, or nowadays when the Idrisi calls on them to rally to his standard under their tribal leader. In normal times some are at enmity with others, and although Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim may be called in to settle tribal disputes and is responsible to Idrisi for their good order, he has nothing to do with their tribal administration. They are in fact a loose confederation, who will only combine for defence in face of a danger which threatens to extinguish all, and for offence at the bidding of Idrisi. On this account they are dealt with one by one, but are grouped together under the heading of Qahtan for convenience of reference. They are far too removed from the northern Qahtan to keep in touch with them, and never go near their country. Sometimes, in times of drought, a few of the former come down south and are always well received, but the connexion ends at that. The southern Qahtan tribes are for the most part, and with the exception of certain nomad sub-tribes, well conducted and prosperous, and interested in trade or agriculture. The different sections vary con siderably in military skill, and few of them appear to have inherited the characteristics which have earned for their northern relations such an unsavoury reputation. A a 2188 33- 'Abidah. The 'ABIDAH (or 'Abidah) appear to be the bravest as well as the most prosperous and enterprising section of the Qahtan. Their boundary in the south, where they have their villages, is well defined, but to the north their nomads wander over a vast stretch of country, and for almost 150 miles their western boundary adjoins that of the Shahran. To the cast lies Tathlith and the Yam tribes, to the south the Beni Bishr, and to the south-west the Rufeidat el-Yemen. The 'Abidah will follow Mohammed ibn Dhuleim in battle, but they do not like the Shereif in normal times, and look to their own chief Sheikh, Sa'd ibn Suleim, in tribal matters. The latter is a man of about 40, and lives at Khamis 'Abidah, the principal village and market-place of the tribe. He is a rich man, and owns a large estate, and is much liked by his tribes men, both for his justice and fairness and because he always is in the fore front of every fight. His sister married one of the sons of 'Abd el-'Aziz Musheit, chief of the Shahran, about 20 years ago, and a truce was made between the two tribes. Shortly afterwards he had the misfortune to kill another of 'Abd el-'Aziz's sons in a petty tribal dispute, and war again broke out and continued until Idrisi pacified the country. There is still a bitter hatred between the two, which shows itself in periodical outbreaks. So deep is the enmity that in the case of a murder of an 'Abidah man by a Shahran no question of blood money is entertained, and the murdered man's relations do not rest until they have killed a Shahran tribesman in return. Sheikh Sa'd ibn Suleim was formerly with the Turks, but he joined Idrisi in his first revolt and has been one of his most faithful followers ever since. Idrisi has a representative at Khamis 'Abidah, who collects taxes from all the tribe. 4 The 'Abidah engage largely in trading, and buy up much of the coffee which comes from the district round Jebel Razah through Wada', subse quently selling it throughout Asir. Some of them live permanently in Rijal, Ibha, and Namas, and others are engaged in the Jiddah trade. They are a very industrious race, always on the look-out for making money, and their villages are numerous and well built. They also specialize as masons and ply their trade throughout Asir. They do not agree with the Shereif or Beni Bishr in peace time, but are friendly with the Rufeidat el-Yemen and Senhan el-Hibab. Unlike a great many tribes the 'Abidah are entirely united, and the nomads are guided in their policy by the villagers. They are rich in dark- haired camels and black sheep, and take great pride in their pedigree horses. They will sell their poorer animals in the market, but they take great care of their finer beasts, feeding them on milk and only parting with them on special occasions, such as when they make a present to the Idrisi. The A1 Hamdan and Hurjan, who number about 3,000 men and 2,000 men respectively, are the two largest sections of the nomads. They come down to Khamis 'Abidah for the harvest, and afterwards go up to Bishah with the other nomads for the date season. They also wander189 out to Tathlith, where they meet other Qahtan Arabs and those of the Yam tribes, and where are to be found succulent grasses on which to fatten their herds. Their country abounds in gum, which they collect and sell in Khamis 'Abidah. In war they fight on camel- or horse-back, and carry rifles, lances, and long curved jendbih. For a long time the A1 Rusheid and A1 Ghamar of the Shahran used to pay them money in order to escape being raided, but Sheikh 'Abd el-Aziz ibn Musheit refused to countenance this. They are always at odds with the northern nomads of the Shahran, and sometimes cut across and raid the Bishah-Ibha road round Bir UmmSarar. The 'Abidah do not seem to have inherited the bad qualities of the northern Qahtan. The whole tribe has a reputation for hospitality, and the nomads, though wild and rough, are not reckoned treacherous. Paramount Sheikh : Sa'd ibn Suleim. (a) Settled. 6,000 men. Clans are :— A1 Ejreish Nasir ibn Qidim. A1 Bassam Sha'eil. A1 es-Sadr (Saqr) 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Jalal. A1 Umm 'Ammir Sa'id ibn el-Ghamas. A1 ez-Zuheir Mohammed Abu Lughud.

The BENI BISHR stretch from the down country of the central plateau to the mountainous slopes leading down to the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, their nearest point to Sabia being about 30 miles away. Their country is barren in the east, but productive and well forested near the sea. The adjoining tribes are the 'Abidah on the north. Yam, Shereif, and Senhan el-Hibab on the east, Beni Jum'ah on the south, and the Naj'u and Rufeidat el-Yemen on the west. The tribe numbers about 1,000 settled men and 3,000 nomads. 'Abd el-Hadi is the chief Sheikh, but his influence over the nomads is only nominal. He deserted the Turks some years ago, and all the tribes pay taxes to Idrlsi now. The settled portion190 is hospitable and prosperous, but the nomads are wild and intractable, almost without religion, and with no marriage laws. They roam chiefly about the Tihamah, and are rich in a breed of large black sheep. The tribe is friendly with the 'Abidah and Rufeidat el-Yemen and generally at odds with the Naj'u, Senhan, and Yam. Chief Sheikh : 'Abd el-Hadi. 4 ,000 men. (a) Settled. 1,000 men. Chief villages are :— Usran Mohammed ibn 'Abd. Shaqb Meidh. 'Abidiyah Selman. Al Umm 'A'idh Shei ibn Mohammed. Mufarrij Mohammed ibn Hadi. Al Lerhat Sa'd ibn Hasan. {b) Nomads. 3,000 men. Al 'Urfan is the chief division, clans being :— Al Heyal. Al Ferhan. Tihman. Al Ar'ab. Al Umm Mohammed. 35. Rufeidat el-Yemen. The RUFEIDA1 EL-YEMEN is a large tribe, numbering some 15,000 men, to the south-east of Ibha, extending up the main mountain ridge and on to the plateau to beyond the source of the Wadi Shahran. The tribe is divided into four main divisions, the Al el-JihaJ, Bishat ibn Salim, Beni Qeis, and Sha'af Yarimah wa Khutab. The chief Sheikh over all the tribe is Husein ibn Heif, a man of 40, who lives at Mudhiq, where he is a large and prosperous landowner. His father was a mudir under the Turks, and died in the Ghamid country fighting for them; but Husein ibn Heif joined Idrisi when he first revolted, and fought for him in 1910. His tribe shares his dislike of the Turks, and respects and obeys him. The Al el-Jihal have for generations been separated from the rest of the tribe, and lived a few miles to the west with the Sha'af Rashhah and Al Sirhan sections of the Shahran. They have not, however, intermarried with the latter, and are obedient to Husein ibn Heif, although they do not join in any of the quarrels which constantly occur between their own tribe and their hereditary enemies the Shahran, They are strongly in favour of Idrisi and have fought for him on several occasions. The chief of the Bishat Ibn Salim is Mohammed ibn 'Ali walad 'Ali ibn Mura'i, a shifty and cowardly man of about 45, who supports the Turks and is paid by them. This section pays taxes to the Government. The Beni Qeis lie to the east of the Bishat Ibn Salim, and also pay taxes to the Turks. Their Sheikh, Mohammed Abu Salam, is now an old man of 75 and deaf. He has always had the reputation of siding with the strongest party. The nomad portion of this section, the Al Shuwat, are independent of him and the Turks.191 The Sha'af Yarimah wa Khutab who live to the south are likewise free, and the allegiance which they pay to Idrisi is only nominal. They are a wild and suspicious people, and though they have no objection to entertaining guests, they will not suffer them to sleep in their tents. The country of the Rufeidat el-Yemen is for the most part fertile and densely wooded on the slopes of the hills, and the tribe is a prosperous one. They are not noted for their martial ardour, though the A1 el-Jihal and the nomads can fight well. They are nicknamed by the other tribes the 'Muhanyatein el-Murrah', owing to their habit of staining their women with henna. All that portion of the tribe which is against the Turks recognize the overlordship of Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim of the Shereif. The sister of Husein ibn Heif is married to Sheikh Mohammed, and the two chiefs are close friends. Paramount Sheikh : Husein ibn Heif. 15,000 men. {a) Al el-Jihal. 4,000 men. Mohammed ibn Shuweil.

The SENHAN EL-HIBAB inhabit the Asir plateau, and are bounded on the north by the Shereif and Yam, east by the Wada'ah, and west by the Beni Bishr. The tribe numbers about 4,000 men, of whom three-quarters are nomads. The villagers have a good reputation with travellers, but the nomads are wild and savage, frequently cutting the roads and sparing neither man, woman, nor child when on the raid. The nomads do not cultivate, but they are rich in a dark breed of camels, and collect gum which they sell chiefly in Khamis 'Abidah. They wear long black garments. They are a warlike tribe, and are well led by Sheikh Ferdan ibn Dhuleim, a man of about 35, who lives in Rahat es-Senhan. The villagers pay taxes to Idrisi, but the nomads will not do more than help him in war. Their friends are the 'Abidah and Beni Bishr ; their foes the Shereif, Wada'ah, and Yam. When Idrisi calls on them to fight they unite under Mohammed ibn Dhuleim of the Shereif, but in normal times they pay him only a nominal allegiance. Chief Sheikh : Ferdan ibn Dhuleim. 4,000 men. (a) Settled. 1,000 men. Chief villages are :— Rahat es-Senhan. Hadhb. Khadd. Al Ferwan. Trq. 1. Settled. 2,400 men.

A1 Ghazi. Al esh-Sherif. A1 Selman. Al Shoqan. 37. Shereif. The SHEREIF inhabit the down country to the west of^ the Yam tribes, and are bounded on the north by the Beni Bishr and Yam on the east by the Yam, on the south by the Senhan el-Hibab, and on the west by the Beni Bishr. , Their country is flat and treeless, and most of their cultivation is from well water. They are traders rather than agriculturists, and are wel conducted and unwarlike. Their number does not exceed 800 men of whom a quarter are nomads. They are chiefly known on account of heir leader. Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim. His father, Dhuleim ibn Sha r, who died about 16 years ago, was a famous man in Asir, and for many years was the Mudir of all Qahtan tribes. His head-quarters were at Harajah in Shereif, where there was also a Turkish garrison Mohammed ibn Dhuleim succeeded him at a monthly salary of £25. but seceded to Idrisi when the latter raised his standard of revolt. The Turks thereupon sent an expedition against him and burnt his fortress in Harajah, but were ultimately forced to retire and have not penetrated to his country since. Idrisi made him one of his Muqdamis or generals, and he was m com- mand of the Qahtan tribes in the fighting against the Turks and e Sherif of Mecca in 1910. Afterwards he and Seyyid 'Arar ibn Nasir led Idrisi's army against the Imam 's forces under Mohammed Abu Nuweibah, in the Sahar country, about three years ago. He is still a young man about 35 years of age, rich according to the standards of the country, an with an excellent reputation both as a leader in war and a tribal admims- trator. Chief Sheikh : Mohammed ibn Dhuleim. 800 men. {a) Settled. 600 men. Chief villages are :— Al Dhuleim Nasir ibn Dhuleim. Al 'Ajlah Mohammed ibn J abb an. Harajah 'Awad ibn Mihmas. Hamra Sa&lt;Id ibn Ben ayah. Beidha Mas'ud. (h) Nomads. 200 men. g er i Dhuleim ibn Shayy. 38. Wadd'ah. The WADA'AH are a small mercantile tribe numbering about 600 men, living in the district of the same name near the Yam tribes of Nejran. They are bounded on the north and east by the Yam, and on the west by A. Bb194 the Senhan el-Hibab. Their country is not naturally productive, but they have a large number of wells, and grow grapes which they convert into raisins and sell as far as Ibha and Rijal. They also import coffee from Jebel Razah and Khaulan esh-Sham, and sell it in Asir or to the merchants of Rufeidat el-Yemen. They are generally on bad terms with the Yam tribes, but are not a quarrelsome or pugnacious tribe. Idrisi has his police and tax-gatherers amongst them as he has amongst the other Qahtan tribes. 'Ali Rukwan, their chief Sheikh, goes on pilgrimage nearly every year, and acts as Emir el-Hajj for all the southern Qahtan tribes. Chief Sheikh : 'Ali ibn Rukwan. 600 men. Chief villages ;— Dhahran. Safwan. Beida. Trj Wada/ah. 39. Rabi'ah Mujatirah. The RABTAH MUJATIRAH are a wild nomad tribe numbering about 5,000 men. The Barak-Qunfudah road runs through the middle of their territory for about 20 miles between the villages of Ghar el-Hindi and Juma'ah Rabi'ah. 1 hey are bounded on the north by the Beni Shihir, on the east by the Humeidah, on the south by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin, and on the west by the Bela'ir. They are said to be fairer of face than most Arabs, with blue eyes, and to wear their hair well down over the shoulders. They are almost pagan, and at odds with all the world except the Rabl'at et-Tahahin, who are as savage as themselves. Idrisi sometimes succeeds in levying taxes on them, but his influence is only nominal. Passage through their country is dangerous both to the Turks and ordinary way farers. They are rich in camels and cattle. A small clan of the Al Ikhleif section of the Al ed-Dureib lives in the north-east comer of their territory with their consent. 40. RahVat et-Tahdhin. The RABrAT ET-TAHAHlN hold the country on either side of the Sikkat el-Helawiyah (Muha'il-Qunfudah road), between the villages of Ma'mal Al Ikhleif and Markh, a distance of about 30 miles. They are bounded on the west by the Bela'ir, on the north by the Bela'ir, Rabi'ah Mujatirah and Humeidah, on the east by the Al Jebali and Al ed-Dureib, and on the south by the Beni Hilal and the Hali tribes. Their country is mountainous and well wooded, and they are rich in camels, goats, and cattle. About 2,000 in number of fighting men, they are entirely nomad, despise all forms of husbandry, and are a terror to travellers on the road. They are allied with the Rabi'ah Mujatirah and Al ed-Dureib, and generally on fair terms with the Hali tribes. With the Beni Hilal, Bela'ir, Humeidah, and Al Jebali, they keep up incessant feuds.195 The Turks have never been able to do anything with them, but Idrisi is able to tax them to a certain extent, and what outside sympathies they have are for him. The RABI'AH WA RUFEIDAH stretch from a few miles NNW. of Ibha to within about 15 miles of Muha'il, their country being about 35 miles from north to south, and 20 miles from east to west on the average, though it tapers to a point in the north. Ihe tribes which adjoin them are : on the north the Reish, on the east the Balahmar and Beni Malik, on the south the 'Alqam el-Hul, and on the west the Rijal el-M a and Beni Thuwwah. The tribe is divided into four main divisions, the Rabi'at esh- Sham, A1 'Asimah, Rufeidat esh-Sham, and A1 Harith. Ihe Rabi'at esh- Sham and Rufeidat esh-Sham have no relationship or connexion with the Rabi'at el-Yemen and Rufeidat el-Yemen as might be supposed. The Rabl'at esh-Sham occupy the southern portion of the territory, being entirely settled in villages along the Ibha-Athalif road. They have no Chief Sheikh, having expelled 'A idh ibn Hasan, their former Sheikh, on account of his desertion to the Turks. The A1 'Asimah are partly settled and partly nomad, chiefly along the Beni Thuwwah boundary. Their Chief Sheikh, 'Ali ibn Hamud, fought for Idrisi in 1910, was captured by the Turks, and after a year's imprisonment was released and reinstated. The A1 Harith, who are both settled and nomad, live in the Wadi Tayyah, along which is the main road from Ibha to Muha il, and for years have given a great deal of trouble to the Government. The W adi 1 ayyah is the head-quarters of all the bad characters in the neighbouring country, and a caravan has to be very strong to pass through without paying toll. The A1 Harith are notoriously treacherous, and their hand is against the whole world, including their own tribe. 1 hey engage in the camel- carrying trade to a certain extent between Muha il and the Rijal el-M a, but they seldom venture near Ibha, nor can the Turks levy taxes fiom them, as they sometimes do from the rest of the tribe. 1 heir Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Shahir, has a very bad reputation. The tribe as a whole favours Idrisi, chiefly because it is discon tented with the Government. It is, however, notoriously fiekle and unreliable, and goes with the side which pays it best. It maintains a hereditary feud with the Rijal el-M'a. It is descended from Qahtan. (a) Rabiat esh-Shdm. Settled, 1,500 men. Chief clan is Beni Ghanmi. Sheikh : El-Fejih. Chief villages are :— 41. Rabl'ah wa Rufeidah. Teihan Umm Sheraf Umm Sauli 'Amr ibn 'Abdullah. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdillah. Ahmed ibn Ghanmi. b b 2197 42. Rahl'at el-Yemen. The RABrAT EL-YEMEN are a nomadic tribe keeping chiefly to Wadi Dhil'a (Dhulah) and Wadi Shahlah, and sometimes going down to Shuqaiq or up to the Beni Mugheid country. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Mugheid on the north and north-east, the Shahran on the south-east, the Beni Shi'bah and other nomads of Mikhlaf el-Yemen on the south, and the Rijal el-M'a on the west. They are rich in camels, donkeys, and flocks, and make a good living by selling semn in Ibha. They are well armed with the type of French rifle which they call ' Abu Bukrah', and carry shields, as well as long curved knives {jendbih.) They are noted for their bravery, and deem it a disgrace to die in their beds. Though wild and rough and with such a contempt for marriage that as a rule they have to be known by the names of their mothers, they are nevertheless hospitable, and clean in their fighting, and have the reputa tion of never going back on their word once given. In person they are very tall and fairer than most Arabs, with blue eyes. Ihey say they are descended from the Ashraf el-Huseiniyah, but their enemies name the Sulubba (Sulabah), or wandering gipsy tinkers, as their forefathers. They pay but little attention to religion, and on the first day of Ramadan choose thirty young men, whom they dress in white and compel to fast for one day at some appointed place, on behalf of the whole tribe. Having done this they have a feast, and taunt the neighbouring nomads for their inability to rise to such heights of self-sacrifice. They are a united and conservative tribe, condemning those who smoke, and in their contempt for foreign luxuries eating only milk and meat. They live in straw-plaited tents. Their friends are the Beni Mugheid! their enemies, the Rijal el-M a, Shahran, Beni Shi'bah, and Naj'u. The Turks have never been able to keep them in order, and their attitude to Idrisi depends entirely on his power to make them obey. 'Ali ibn Jabbar is their chief Sheikh, a man of 45 and a noted warrior. He is said to have the tribe well in hand : he pays a nominal allegiance to Idrisi, but will not allow him to collect taxes. {Auldd Al Umm Husein). Chief Sheikh : 'Ali ibn Jabbar.

The REISH are to the north and north-east of Muha'il, and are bounded on the north by the Al Musa ibn 'Ali and the Umm Shahari section of the Beni Shihir, on the east by the Balasmar, on the south by the Beni Thuwwah and Al Musa, and on the west by the Al ed-Dureib. Iheir southern boundary comes to within 5 miles of Muha'il. Ihey are divided into two sections of Reish and Al Meshwal, and number about 2,500 men. But although fairly numerous, they are cowardly and unwarlike, and are classed in contempt with the Beni Malik, by the fighting tribes round. They all favour Idrisi and pay him taxes. They tried to make a stand in 1912 against the Sherif of Mecca, but were badly worsted and their country laid waste. They are entirely sedentary and engaged in farming. The country is fairly level, thickly wooded, and productive, with running streams in places. Their enemies are Balasmar, Beni Shihir, and Balahmar; their allies, the Barak tribes, the Al Musa, Beni Thuwwah, and the Beni Qutabah and Beni Dhalim of the Rijal el-M'a. An isolated colony own the village of Mandar in the Balasmar country, and hold aloof from any hostilities which take place between the two tribes. Their Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Muzhar, has no cause to love the Turks, who killed his son in 1910. Chief Sheikh : Mohammed ibn Muzhar. 1,500 men. Chief villages :— Mandar Ibn Dhiheib. Qurn el-M'a Rajih.

The RIJAL EL-M'A, though not so numerous as some of the Asir tribes—it can at most put 17,000 men in the field—is nevertheless one of the most renowned for its courage and dash in war, its internal unity, and its pride of independence. Its country lies between Ibha and the sea, and199 is roughly a stretch of 50 miles from NW. to SE., and 25 miles from NE t to SW. Its neighbours are the Bahr ibn Sekeinah and Beni Thuwwah on the north, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, 'Alqam, Beni Mugheid, and Rabi'at el-Yemen on the east, Ben Shi'bah on the south, and Munjahah and Beni Hilal on the west. The tribe is divided into seven subdivisions: the Beni Qutabah, Beni Dhalim, Beni Junah, Jeis ibn Mas'udi, Beni Zeidin, Shahab, and Umm Bina. The chief Sheikh of the whole tribe is Ibrahim ibn Muta'ali of Julia, a man much respected for his prowess in war and his wisdom in tribal matters. He is now over 70 years of age, and for some time most of the administration has devolved on his son, Ahmed ibn Muta'ali. The latter is a tall man of about 30, with a fair skin, who first made his name as a fighter when the Rijal el-M'a overran Mikhlaf el-Yemen just before the rise of the Idrlsi. He fought the Sherif in 1910 at Muha'il and in the Balahmar country, but withdrew his forces at a critical moment owing to the appointment of Seyyid Mustafa, of the Bahr ibn Sekeinah, as general of the whole Asir army. So greatly did the Rijal el-M'a resent having an outsider placed over them, that soon after one of their minor Sheikhs, Seyyid Yahya walad esh-Sheiri, with the full approval of the tribe, attempted to murder him. Idrisi gave way on the matter, but the mischief had been done, and the Rijal el-M'a took no further part in the campaign. Of the sub-tribes, the Beni Qutabah live in the fertile valley of Wadi 'Us, which rises near Suda, and joining the Wadi Ahabesh near Athalif eventually flows into the Wadi Dhofa' by Muha'il. The Beni Qutabah stretch from near its source to beyond Athalif in a succession of villages surrounded by cultivation. The slopes of the hills and the valleys, except where cleared, are here, as elsewhere in the Rijal el-M'a country, deeply forested. The Beni Qutabah, though dwelling in villages, are of a wandering temperament, and are the chief camel carriers on all the trade routes of Asir, going to Sabia, Qunfudah, Birk, and sometimes as far as Blshah and Mecca. There is a small colony of 'Abadilah Ashraf, who live with them and wield a certain amount of influence. The Sheikh of Athalif, Ibrahim el-Hufdhi, is a man of some notoriety. His father was made a Kaimmakam by the Turks, and granted a pension of £15 a month, which was paid to his family until the tribe revolted. Ibrahim el-Hufdhi went to Constantinople in I9 I 4 to assert his loyalty to the Turks and ask that the pension should continue to be paid to him. His influence in the tribe is not great. The Beni Dhalim lie to the south of the Wadi'Os and are entirely settled. They are the largest section, numbering 4,000 men, and also by far the richest. They have most of the trade of Asir in their hands, and bring petroleum, sugar, tea, clothing, &amp;c., from Aden and Musawwa', which they sell chiefly in the large village of Rijal. They have been the200 foremost pioneers in the importation of fire-arms from Jibuti, which lias increased so largely during the last few years and which the lurks have found it impossible to check. Rijal is the focus of all local products and skins; gum and semn are brought from as far as the Shahran country, bought by the Beni Dhalim merchants, and exported to Aden. The village next in importance is Sha'bein, the chief rifle market. The Rijal el-M'a never marry outside their own country, but as they have grown rich, they have bought much land in the neighbouring districts of 'Alqam el-Hul and Rabi'at el-Yemen. Amongst the most wealthy of them is a family of Seyyids, known as the Sa'dat en-Na'amiyah, who have lived amongst them for many generations, and whose head, Seyyid Husein en-Na'ami, is the most important leader in war after Ahmed el-Muta'ali and Ahmed el-Hayyani. The Beni Junah are partly settled in villages and partly nomad, and inhabit the country towards the Munjahah. They, too, engage in trade to a certain extent, and one of their Sheikhs, Ayuh, was the first man to start the gun-running venture. The village of Jabut was the chief centre, and received its name from Jibuti. They are also occupied with home industries, and both men and women are employed in making straw woven articles, such as matting, baskets, and hats, which they call ' tof- fush ', and which are largely worn by the women of Asir. The most important man of the Beni Dhalim and one of the best known in Asir is Zein el-'Abidm, chief Mufti of Asir, and greatly trusted by Idrisi. Educated at Zebid, he had already become a force in Asir before the rise of Idrisi, by reason of his learning and the justice of his decisions. He now has powers of life and death, and is the chief judge of appeals from the judgements of the tribal Qadhis and Muftis wherever the power of Idrisi runs. He is also frequently called in to arbitrate in the more important tribal disputes, and as the Rijal el-M'a have implicit confidence in him and are willing to back it by force of arms, his influence is very great. He is now a man of about 40 years of age, and has houses in Sabia and Rijal. The Jeis ibn Mas'udi live near the 'Alqam el-Hul border and are the aristocrats of the tribe. The paramount family belongs to them, and they consider it beneath their dignity to engage in trade of any sort. They live for fighting alone, and have as high a reputation for courage as any tribe in the country. Their integrity, too, is unchallenged, and in most of the tribal disputes in neighbouring friendly tribes they are called in to arbitrate. In the south are the Beni Zeidm along the Beni Mugheid and Beni Shi'bah boundaries. They, too, are noted fighters. They grow much coffee on the slopes of the hills and their nomad clans are rich in flocks. Their chief Sheikh is Ahmed el-Hayyani, who lives at Hiswa. He is a man of about 45, and after Ahmed ibn Muta'ali he is the most im portant man in the tribe. An enemy of the Turks since childhood, he201 eagerly supported Tdrisi, and is said to have almost as much influence with him as Mohammed Yahya Ba Sahi. He is a great friend of Seyyid Mustafa, and keeps on good, though at times jealous, terms with Ahmed ibn Muta'ali. The Shahab andUmm Bina share the country in theWadi Ahabesh to the north. They are entirely agricultural and pastoral, and seldom leave their borders except to fight. The Rijal el-M'a are foes with the Beni Hilal, Beni Mugheid, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, A1 Musa, and Munjahah. With the Beni Thuwwah, 'Alqam, and Beni Shi'bah they are allies. They were once good friends of the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah, but relations have been strained since the Seyyid Mustafa episode. Before Idrlsi arose, they were under the domination of the Turks, but since his revolt they have entirely thrown off their yoke. During the last few years, the road to Muha'il from Ibha, via Athalif, has been closed to the Turks, and frequent dashes are made to the main Muha'il-Ibha road when news is received that a Turkish convoy is passing through. They support Idrisi as equals, rather than as subjects, and will neither consent to pay him taxes nor suffer his officers to rule them. They have a code of justice amongst themselves which is fairly rough and ready, but is rigidly enforced. Murder is severely punished, sometimes by death, sometimes by the payment of blood-money ; theft, after two warnings and when proved by witnesses on oath, by the loss of a hand. There is a fixed dowry, both for rich and poor of f 120, and plurality of wives is the exception. Ihere is a strong feeling against divorce without adequate reason. A man is considered justified in taking a second wife, if the first fails to bear him children, but such a failure is not a sufficient excuse for a divorce.

A. c c204 these villages were a succession of small independent units, each a law to itself and generally at odds with its neighbour. Ihe lurks never attempted a proper administration of the country, and violence was rife to such a degree that only large armed parties could travel with safety. Only when the hillsmen descended on them was there any degree of cohesion, and in the last attack of the Rijal el-M'a, which took place about thirteen years ago, the villagers all combined to save their homes. The first task of Idrisi was to conciliate the different warring elements and to promote peace, and to-day the district is thoroughly under control and law abiding. The largest element of the population is of Sudanese blood, partly unemancipated slaves, but chiefly those who have gained their freedom. With these are the Muwallads, Sudanese with an Arab strain, and over them the Arabs of pure blood and the Sa'dah and Ashraf. Sabia itself, of course, contains merchants from other Mohammedan countries, the strongest element coming from the Hadhramaut. Mohammed \ ahya Ba Sahi, the chief adviser of Idrisi, and the Emir of all Mikhlaf el- Yemen, which of course includes Sabia, is from that country. The Idrisi's standing army of about 500 men is entirely recruited from amongst the Sudanese round Sabia, and they can muster about 10,000 men when the general rally is sounded. The following is a list of the chief villages and their approximate number of fighting men. Sabia.

Shahrdn. The SHAHRAN cover a greater stretch of country than any other tribe in Asir, and are the largest numerically. The country round Bishah is theirs and they follow the Wadi Shahran to its source and thence to within 20 miles of Sabia, a distance from north to south of more than 200 miles. Their boundary from east to west of the Wadi Shahran is undefined and constantly changing, as one or the other of the neighbouring nomad tribes gains the upper hand. Farther south it is fixed and varies from 5 to 50 miles in breadth. Their neighbours on the north are the wandering Shalawahand SebeiSon the east the'Abidah andRufeidat el-Yemen, on the south thpNaj'u, and on the west, starting near the sea and working north, the Bern Shi'bah, Beni Mugheid (where these come to within four miles of Ibha), Beni Malik, Balahmar, Balasmar, Beni Shihir, Bulqarn, and Sham- ran. The Shahran, like the Beni Shihir, Shamran, and other tribes of Asir, trace their descent to the Rijal el-Hajar. The tribe is divided into nine main d. visions,the A1 Musheit, A1 Rusheid, A1 Ghamar, Nahas, Qa'ud, Beni Pijad, Beni Wahhab, Sha'af Rashhah, and A1 Yinfa'ah. x ne A1 Musheit are numerically the smallest, but politically the most important sub-tribe, since they contain the ruling tribal family. In former days its influence over the whole tribe was unquestioned, but since Idrisi's rise to fame some sections have joined him, while others have remained faithful to the Turks, and discord has crept in and weakened its power. It is still, however, very powerful, and in purely tribal matters has the ultimate word over the majority. The paramount chief is l Abd el-'Aziz ibn Musheit, now an old man of 60, who lives in considerable state at Dhahban, and also owns a house in Khamis Musheit, the largest and most important trading centre in Asir. Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz is a rich man, since he levies his own taxes in this town, taking a piastre for every donkey sold, 2 piastres for each camel, and 5 piastres for a skin of semn, &amp;c. The Turks do not interfere with him in this, but content them selves with taking ' 'ushur' from the local cultivators. He is, however, expected to entertain freely members of the outlying sub-tribes who visit him, and always keeps an open house. In his old age he has taken to drink, and leaves all the active management of the tribe to his son, Sa'id ibn 'Abd. The latter like his father supported the Turks, but he is also said to be in correspondence with Idrisi. He is now about 32 years old, and is popular with the tribe and, as a leader, famous in war. The only other man of importance in the family is Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz's nephew, Sa'd ibn Husein, who has been won over by Idrisi with the promise of the chief Sheikhship if he can oust his uncle and cousin. &lt; *His appointment, however, would not be popular with the tribe, for he is reputed to be mean and overbearing. His two brothers, 'Abd ibn Ibrahim and Husein ibn 'Abd, are with him but have not much influence. The A1 Rusheid live round Khamis Musheit and towards Ibha and number about 4,000 men. 'Ali ibn 'Iteij is their chief Sheikh, a fighter of repute. They all support the Turks but they refuse to pay them taxes, nor do they join the local gendarmerie. They are a prosperous community and their nomads are rich in a breed of large white sheep. They also own many horses. They have not a good reputation in war. The Al Ghamar are braver than the A1 Rusheid and quarrel with them. They live along the Beni Malik boundary, and muster about 1,000 men, of whom 600 are nomads. Mohammed ibn 'Urur, their chief Sheikh, dislikes Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz and supports Idrisi. His followers, however, keep very much to their own country and do not meddle in politics. The Nahas are a purely nomad section and are rich in horses and sheep. They live out to the east along the 'Abidah boundary, and are of all the Shahran the most famous in war. They do all their fighting on horseback, principally against the 'Abidah. The Qa'ud and the Al Rusheid pay them ' khawah ' at the rate of 12 piastres for every well as a bribe against being plundered. They have no cultivation and live by selling semn and their animals in Khamis Musheit. Their young men are not permitted to wear rings until they have killed a man, and once blooded they cut a notch on the stock of their rifles for each of their victims. Utterly out of hand, they never approach Ibha, and recognize neither the Turks nor Idrisi nor their own paramount Sheikh. 'A'idh ibn Jabbar is their chief, a man of 50, who has led them into battle for years. The Qa'ud are entirely settled in Wadi Tindahah, which flows into the Wadi Shahran, and is the most fertile of all the Shahran country. They are peaceable and unwarlike, and obedient to Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. The Beni Bijad are a large sub-tribe numbering 10,000 men, of whom 7,000 are nomads. The settled portion lives along the Ibha-Bishah road between Al Batat and Shafan, and is entirely agricultural. The nomads are warlike and fight both on horseback and on foot. Their cavalry carry lances as well as rifles. They are on bad terms with the Beni Wahhab and fight the 'Abidah, Balahmar, and Balasmar. Like most nomads they go up to Bishah for the date season. Sa'id ibn Hashbal is chief over all the sub-tribe. He was formerly with the Turks, but now sides with Idrisi, and only pays a nominal allegiance to Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. He collects tithes from his followers, with whom he is popular, and is a rich man. The Beni Wahhab are the largest sub-tribe, numbering 15,000 men, of whom 13,000 are nomads. They live in the Wadi Shahran up to Bishah. Of all Arabs they have the most evil reputation. They are robbers and highwaymen, treacherous, even to their guests, have little religion and no marriage laws, and kill women and children in their raids, a custom207 which is execrated by all other fighting tribes. They are also unclean in their feeding and eat rats and jerboas. The man with the strongest hand rules them, and the present Sheikh, Nasir ibn Heif, and Heif ibn Nasir, his son, won their position by forcibly ejecting the former Sheikh, Ibn Hashal, who has now degenerated into a petty and uninfluential highwayman. They are against every tribe and every Government and are paid by other weaker tribes to refrain from raiding. The villagers of Bishah and the clans who live near, such as the Rimathan, Uqlub, and Beni Sulul, are, however, slightly more civilized. Only during the date season at Bishah, which lasts about four months, there is a general truce and Arabs from all over the country foregather. Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz owns large and valuable date groves, and both the Sherif of Mecca and Idrisi have agents there. These two agents belong to the Beni Wahhab, Sheikh Yahya ibn Fa'iz acting for the Sherif, and Nasir ibn Kurkman for Idrlsi, for the purpose of collecting ' Zakat'. The former is the more influential. The Beni Wahhab go out to Tathlith at certain seasons of the year, where there is excellent grazing for their many flocks and herds. The Sha'af Rashhah and A1 Yinfa'ah occupy the Tihamah to the south of Ibha, from which they are separated by the Beni Mugheid. The Sha'af Rashhah, who are to the north of the A1 Yinfa'ah, are entirely settled and peaceful. The A1 Yinfa'ah live in the district of Temniyah (Thimniyah), which is the most fertile of all Asir, and approach to within 20 miles of Sabia. They are numerous and wealthy and have a good reputation for hospitality and courage. 'Abdullah ibn Hamad is the chief Sheikh of both sections, a tall man of about 55, with a long white beard. He was formerly on the side of the Turks but broke with them and with Sheikh 'Abd el-'AzIz about 8 years ago, when his son was murdered by the Beni Wahhab, while a guest of Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. Since then he has joined Idrisi, and being a man of great influence has brought his tribe with him. Idrisi now collects taxes from them and keeps about 100 police at Temniyah. The enemies of these two sub-tribes are the Rufeidat el-Yemen and Rabi'ah: their friends, the Arabs of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. The nomads of A1 Yinfa'ah are horse owners and sell their stock in the Sabia market. (a) AI Musheit. 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Musheit, paramount Sheikh: Sa'id ibn 'Abd, his son.

The BENI SHI'BAH live chiefly round Ttwad (Ttwid) and up the Wadi Dhila' (Dhilah) to the Rabi'at el-Yemen boundary, but their nomads have no fixed boundaries and wander all over Mikhlaf el-Yemen, north of Sabia. Their Sheikhs and chief families are Arabs and trace their descent to Qahtan, but the majority of the tribe are Sudanese, who have been emancipated for many generations. They are excellent fighters, amenable to discipline, and are generally known as the 'Asakir', or soldiers. They all support Idrlsi and pay him taxes. The Beni Shi'bah do not engage in trade, the villagers being agricul turists and the nomads possessing large herds of camels, cattle, and sheep. They also own horses and nearly always fight as cavalry. They are friendly with the Munjahah, Rijal el-M'a, and the Mikhlaf tribes, but are hereditary enemies of the Rabi'at el-Yemen and generally on bad terms with the Beni Mugheid, whose country they avoid.

They are a tall and well-made race, and their women are noted for their beauty. They inhabit the country from the Tihamah 25 miles east of Qunfudah up the main mountain range and across the watershed almost to Wadi Shahran. The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north, starting from the Tihamah, the Bal'aryan, Bulqarn, and Beni 'Amr, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Balasmar, the Reish, the Al Musa ibn 'Ali, the Humeidah, and the Rabi'ah Mujatirah. On the west, where their boundary has narrowed to about 15 miles, are the Zobeid. Their territory is funnel- shaped, widening out as it goes inland, till it reaches the Shahran in the east, with whose boundary it marches for over 60 miles. The settled portion of the tribe have shown little sympathy with Idrisi, and are almost entirely pro-Sherif and Turk. They are divided into three main sections, the north, south, and Tihamah, ruled over by different Sheikhs, who are usually on bad terms with each other, but unite against common enemies. The largest section and the most important politically is the Beni Shihir esh-Sham, who live chiefly along the Ibha-Ta'if road, between 'Asabili and 'Uqrum. The leading family and one of the noblest of Asir, is that of Ibn Qurum, closely connected with Mecca, both by sympathy and relationship, Sherif Mohammed ibn 'Abd el-Mu'in ibn 'Ann, the grand father of the present Sherif, having married into the family. The present head of the family is Sa'id ibn Fa'iz, an old man now, with two sons, both born of a Circassian mother, Faraj Bey ibn Sa'id, who has been one of the Hejaz representatives in the Ottoman Parliament, and Fa'iz ibn Sa'id. They all visit Constantinople and Mecca regularly, have a house in Ibha, and have furnished their house at 'Asabili in semi- European style, and having also adopted the western habit of smoking and drinking, are looked at with dislike and suspicion by other tribes. They are, however, large landowners and rich men and are a decided asset on the side of the Turk and Sherif. In the event of a split between the two, they would probably join the latter. Faraj Bey ibn Sa'id is a tall man of about 38, with a fair skin, which he gets from his mother. He was formerly Kaimmakam of Qunfudah, Muha'il, and Hali district, where his cruelty when in his cups made him greatly feared. He speaks Turkish and French and has a Circassian wife in Constantinople. He is a notorious libertine and drunkard, but is a force to be reckoned with. His brother, Fa'iz ibn Sa'id, a young man of 25, is much more steady and takes greater interest in tribal matters. About a third of the Beni Shihir esh-Sham are nomads, whose main subdivision is that of the Neid. They have little to do with the settled parts, and do not acknowledge Sa'id ibn Fa'iz, the Sherif, or the Turks. D d 2212 Most of their life is spent in bickering with the Shahran, but what political leanings they have, are in favour of Idrlsi. The Beni Shihir el-Yemen occupy the rich district of Namas and are under'Ali Bey ibn Dhafir, who, like the Qurum family, is strongly pro-1 urk. He is, however, a man of much stricter morals, and is respected by the tribes. His mother is a Circassian. This section is entirely settled in permanent villages, and provides a large proportion of the local Turkish gendarmerie. There are said to be a few Idrisi sympathizers, but they dare not openly express their views. The Beni Shihir of the Tihamah are neither as numerous nor as powerful as those of the uplands, but their country is fertile and they are more prosperous than most of their neighbours. Their Chief Sheikh is Abu Mismar, who is said to favour Idrisi secretly. The nomads under Sheikh Khadan ibn Mohammed, are all on the Idrisi side. They live chiefly in 'Aqabah Sajein and 'Aqabah Sihan, between the Namas district and the Tihamah, but go down to lower ground for the harvest. The Beni Shihir are a good fighting tribe, and on account of their political tendencies are almost hemmed in by foes, the Balasmar being the only tribe with whom they have a pact. The Zobeid and they have a feud of many years' standing. They are well armed and receive rifles from the Turks at Ibha. They are descended from the Rijal el-Hajar.

The SHAMRAN occupy a part of the high upland country through which runs the Ibha-Ta'if road and extend down the slopes of the hills to the Tihamah. They are bounded on the west and north by the Ghamid, on the east by the Shahran, and on the south by the Khath'am and Bulqarn. They are divided into the Shamran esh-Sham, Shamran et-Tihamah, and the nomads, each section numbering about 2,000 men. The northern Shamran and the nomads are under the Sheikhship of Hasan ibn Matar, a young man of 30, who has a good reputation for wisdom in tribal matters, and has made a name for himself in war. Their chief centre is Balus, the largest of a number of villages near the Khath'am border, set in a rich and well-wooded valley. The nomads, the Suhab and A1 Mubarak, wander down into the Tihamah in the winter, or stay round Balus, and in the summer go up with the Bulqarn and other nomads to the Shahran country round Bishah for the date season. They own many sheep and goats, but few camels. The most important section of the Shamran et-Tihamah is the 'Ubus, under Sheikh Is-haq ibn Muzellaf, whose chief village is Marwa'. They have permanent villages in which they live during winter, but in summer most of them lead a nomadic life, living in straw-woven tents. The whole tribe unites in war, their chief enemies being the Ghamid. They are also usually at odds with their weaker neighbour the Khath'am. Their reputation as a fighting race is good, and they share with the Bulqarn the custom of purifying themselves and wearing their finest clothes before going into battle. In normal times, they are a hospitable and light-hearted race, every ready to find an excuse for relaxation. Marriage festivals are celebrated on a much larger scale than is usual in Asir. Their outside political leanings are strongly in favour of Idrisi, as against the Sherif of Mecca and the Turks. The tribe is descended from the Rijal el-Hajar. {a) Shamrdn esh-Shdm.

The BENI THUWWAH lie to the south of Muha'il and are astride the main Ibha-Muha'il road between Butuh and the Wadi Sha'b el-'Asla, a distance of 10 miles, and the Ibha-Athalif-Muha'il road between Jebel Hawilah and Hu'us Beni Thuwwah, a distance of 15 miles. The territory between these roads is theirs, and their boundary on the north approaches within 5 miles of Muha'il. Their neighbours on the north are the A1 Musa and Reish, on the east the Balasmar, on the south the A1 Nahyah and Al Harith of the Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, and on the west the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah. The tribe numbers some 2,000 men, of whom two-thirds are settled, the remainder nomad. They are a bold and fearless tribe who live chiefly by raiding, and unprotected parties, either of the Turks or ordinary travellers, are never safe while in their country. They have never submitted to Ottoman authority, and, since the rise of Idrisi, have quite got out of hand. Their chief Sheikh, Sheikh Sarwi, is one of the most noted highwaymen of Asir, and has given endless trouble to the Government. They are generally at feud with the Al Musa, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah and Balasmar, and allied with the Rijal el-M'a and Balahmar. Their relations with Bahr Ibn Sekeinah are neutral.

Beni Ya'lah. The BENI YA'LAH are a small settled tribe, numbering 500 men, situated along the coast a few miles north of Hali. They are bounded on the north by the Marahibah section of the Beni Zeid, on the east by the Aulad el-'Alaunah section of the Ahl Hali, and on the south by the Shawarah section of the Ahl Hali. They are divided amongst themselves. Sheikh Bahran of Shija'fah favouring Idrisi, and the remainder, under Sheikh Beit-'ali Abu 'Atanah, paying allegiance to the Turks. The Bela'ir and Hali both raid them, and they depend chiefly on Shuflut. 'Ali ibn Yahya. Ibrahim ibn Musa'ad. Mushatir. Mohammed ibn Tali'. Ibn Hadhlyah. Sha'ban. Abu Jahllah. Ahmed ibn 'Adwan.

The ZAHRAN is one of the largest tribes of Asir and is bounded on the north by the Beni Malik and Shalawah, on the east by the Ghamid, on the south and south-west by the Zobeid, and on the west by the Dhawi Barakat for a few miles and then the Dhawi Hasan. Their western boundary approaches in places to within 15 miles of the coast, and inland they go up the main mountain range and beyond the Ibha-Ta'if road. Their country is a fertile one and is thickly populated, the whole tribe being said to number 30,000 men. It is divided into two main divisions, the settled and the nomad, of equal size. Rashid ibn Jum'an is paramount sheikh of the villagers and belongs to the main sub-tribe, the Beni Sadr ; Sa'id ibn Aseidan rules over the nomads. The former got his title by inheritance, the latter by his prowess in war; but they are both good men, and have their tribesmen well in hand. When he was a young man, Rashid ibn Jum'an sided with the Turks and was made a Bey, but twelve years ago he raised a successful revolt and has barred the country to the Turks ever since. The nomads were always against them and against the villagers for the same reason, but since the revolt the two chief sheikhs have been good friends. Rashid ibn Jum'an is now a large fat man of 55. He lives at Dus and is married to Nafalah of the Aulad el-Emir Mohammed ibn 'A'idh family of the Beni Mugheid. The Zahran are purely a fighting race and never leave their country, except to raid. They cultivate and become rich thereby, but they despise all other forms of manual labour. The Ghamid are their great and hereditary enemies. They declared for Idrlsi when he first raised his standard in Asir, and fought for him in 1912 against the Turks and Sherif of Mecca. In May 1915 they wrote to Idrisi, proposing to join him, but Idrisi, doubtless realizing that they could do little good while hedged in between the Turks at Ibha and the Sherif, advised them to adopt a passive attitude for the present. He, however, sent a Qadhi to them to obtain monetary help,217 and early in iqi6 reported that he was still in friendly communication with them. The Zahran, like several other tribes of Asir, trace their descent to Rijal el-Hajar. {a) Settled.

Beni Zeid (Northern). The northern BENI ZEID focus round Qunfudah and are entirely under Turkish influence. To the north they inhabit the villages along the Qunfudah-Lith road for some 14 miles, till they reach the boundary of the Al Difra section of the Zobeid. To the east they stretch along the Barak road for 12 miles, almost to 'Umr of the Nawashirah section of Bela'ir, and then, keeping always about 10 miles from the coast, their boundary runs south for 20 miles, marching first with the confines of the Maja'adah section of the Bela'ir and then with the 'Umr Bedawi till it reaches the Beni Ya'lah, when it turns due west to the coast. They are partly settled and partly nomad, the former numbering about 4,000 men, the latter 3,000. The villagers are by no means wealthy, but there is a sufficiency of rain to enable them to cultivate in the summer and their wells provide water to grow vegetables in the dry season. The two nomad sections are the Rabi'ah Weina and the Marahibah: the former strung out along the Qunfudah-Barak road, the latter roaming the country to the south of Qunfudah, along the coast and inland. They are rich in camels, and are the chief carriers to Hali, Muha'il and Barak. Most of them carry antiquated rifles, swords, and a curved knife about 3 feet long, called a a. e e218 Janbiyan. They also supply Qunfudah with milk, and are looked down on by the more independent tribes, both for this practice and for their lack of prowess in war. Hasan ibn Khidhr is the principal Sheikh of the whole tribe, a man of about 30, who has proved a faithful servant of the Turks. He held firm when Idrlsi threatened Qunfudah in 1912, and was given 2,000 rifles by the lurks for defence. The Beni Zeid doubtless owe a great deal to the lurks, for they are on terms of enmity with their neighbours the Bela'ir and 'Umr, and are raided by such distant tribes as the Beni Tsa, Dhawi Barakat, and Dhawi Hasan, who slip through the Zobeid country and back again before they can be brought to book. The Zobeid themselves regard them with tolerance, and the Beni Ya'lah are their allies. Chief Sheikh : Hasan ibn Khidhr. (a) Settled. 4,000 Chief villages are :— Ja' Hasan ibn Khidhr.

Marahibah Mohammed Abu Jabbar. 2,000. 55. Beni Zeid (Southern). A small tribe numbering about 1,500 souls inhabiting the mountains immediately to the east of Beni Hasan. The paramount Sheikh of the tribe and of one of its subsections, the Beni'Aqal, is Mohammed 'Ali Sebak. 1 hey are on friendly terms with the Beni Hasan, who stand in fear of them, and close allies with the Beni Aslam. They are old enemies of the Beni 'Abs, but sink their differences when fighting for Idrisi, as they are doing now. 56. Zobeid. The Zobeid are a detached section of the Harb (see p. 124), and indeed are locally called Harb as often as by their real name. When on the pilgrimage, they generally visit their northern brethren, and are received with honour, and similarly extend a warm welcome to any Harbi who may be in their country. They are hospitable and well conducted, and appear to possess the bravery of their race without its traditional lawlessness. Their boundary starts about 7 miles north of Qunfudah and, after running along the coast for rather more than 20 miles, turns inland and follows the Dhawi Barakat boundary, till it reaches the Zahran. From219 there it runs parallel to the coast and about 30 miles inland along the confines of the Zahran, Ghamid, Bararyan, and Beni Shihir till it reaches a point due east of Qunfudah and then follows the boundaries of the Bela'ir and Beni Zeid to the sea. The Zobeid are settled in permanent villages and are rich in cattle. Their land near the sea is barren except in the wadis, but increases in richness and fertility as soon as the mountains are reached. They are said to number 15,000 men, and their paramount Sheikh is Mu'adi ibn Khair. The whole tribe is strongly in favour of Idrlsi, and pay him taxes. They are equally strong in their feelings against the Turks, who in spite of their proximity have not ventured to interfere with them for years. Their chief enemies are the Beni Shihir, but they dislike and despise the Beni Zeid. With the Dhawi Barakat, the Ghamid, and Zahran, they are friends. The Zobeid go in for gun- running to a certain extent, buying their rifles from Ru'eis near Jiddah, or from Birk, and selling them chiefly to the Zahran.

The E. half of their country is fertilized by W. Siham, and the southern part by W. Ghadir. Their numbers are estimated at 5,000 to 6,000 men, divided into the following sections: Rabasah (round Hodeidah), Muna- firah (E. of these), Hawwah (round Mandar, on the coast, 10 miles S. of Hodeidah), B. Salih (under J. Bura'), Ahl el-Khallfah, Ahl esh-Sha'rah (E. of Marwah), Dar ed-Dom and Ahl Assabt el-Haradah (near J. Bura'). The principal sheikh is Suleiman Hasan of Mahad. There are important settlements of Seyyids at Marwah and at Mansuriyah. Principal villages : 'Asal (Sheikh Yahya Harisah). Mandar ('Ali Wahhaban). Mahad (Suleiman Hasan). Khalifah (Moh. 'Atiyah). Mukeiminiyah (Yusuf 'Ali). Shar'a (Moh. Suleiman). 2. Amanym. A small Zeidi tribe, living round Jebel Qara, on the boundaries of the Hashid country, about 20 miles NW. of Sheharah. They own 15 or 20 small villages, of which the largest is Beit Jashish. Their chief Sheikh is Sheikh Daghshar, a man of about 55, who has considerable influence in the country round. He is a great friend of the Imam and has frequently tried to make peace between him and the Idrisi. 3. Afldh. A small and unimportant tribe allied to the Khairan, to the east of the Beni Aslam in Hajur. Half Zeidi. 4. Beni Ahlas. A small tribe, numbering about 2,400 souls, of the Da'udiyah sect, settled to the east of the Beni Murrah and Beni Muqatil, with whom they are allied. They are good fighters and support the Turks, chiefly by reason of their hatred of the Imam and his Zeidi followers. Coffee and kat are grown in their country. Their chief Sheikh is Nasir Husein el-Ahlasi, an old man of about 65, who visited Constantinople just before the deposition of Sultan Abd el-Hamld. Chief villages: Seihan, Marabah, Rabitah, and Masna'ah.221 5. Ahl 'Ammar. A large and peaceful Zeidi tribe about 20 miles NE. of Qa'tabah, living round Shekab 'Ammar, and cultivating cereals and kat in Wadi Bana. They are descended from Ma'az ibn Jebel Qurishi, who originally lived at Medina, and being sent by the Prophet to the Yemen as governor, settled in Wadi Bana, where his descendants still are. Paramount Sheikh : Tahir Husein el-Farah, of the clan Beit el-Farah. They come under the Kaimmakam of Qa'tabah, and are allied with the 'Od and the Ahl Sha'ir. The chief clans are Beit el-Farah (Sheikh Tahir Husein) and Beit et-Tayyib (Sheikh Hizam es-Sawi). b. Al 'Ammar. A large Zeidi tribe descended from Beni Tamim, owning land round Sa'dah, and leading a nomadic life in the mountains to the E. In the south they go down the W. Amashiyah to the country of the Hashid, with whom they are on good terms. They are excellent fighters and firm adherents of the Imam, whose representative at Sa'dah is Seyyid Mohammed abu Nuweibah, and generally at feud with the Al Damaj. Chief Sheikhs : Seyyid 'Abdullah el-Ma'an, Hadi abu Shihah, and 'A'idh ibn 'Ali. Settled. Chief clans : Beni Merj (Hasan Kumalli), B. Surur (Salih 'Atif), 'Abadilah ('Abdullah el-'Abdalli), B. 'Abdan ('Ali 'Abdan). Nomads. Chief clan : B. Ruham. 7. 'Anazah. Two sections. Sunni, Agricultural. [a) Between the Wa'zat and the Najrah, in the mountains. Chief Sheikhs are Ibn Mas'ud and Husein ibn 'Ali. Neutral towards the Wa'zat. Favour the Imam. (h) S. of J. Reima and W. of the Anis, with whom they are not friendly. They hate the Imam and also the Turks, by whom they have been greatly persecuted. Their chief Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Yahya, a man of 45, who has made overtures to the Idrisi. 8. Ants. The boundaries of the Anis stretch from a short distance west of Dhamar due north nearly to Wa'lan, keeping always a short distance to the west of the Dhamar-San'a road. To the west they extend along the B. Matar confines almost to Mefhaq and then, skirting Menakhah and cutting the W. Siham, go down a few miles south of Jebel Reima, and then across almost to Dhamar. The paramount Sheikh is 'Ali Miqdad, who lives at Jebel esh-Sharq. He is a man of about 50, and used to be a firm adherent of the Imam. He fought for him in 1911 and captured the Turkish Kaimmakam of Dhur'an,222 Zakari Bey. In August 1916, however, he was reported to have quarrelled with the I man and closed the road against him. The Imam accused him of collecting revenues for himself, and dispatched the Dhamar Arabs against him, with what result is not known. The tribe numbers from 8,000 to 10,000 men, but not more than 3,000 can take the field owing to lack of rifles. Their country is fertile, wheat, oats, barley, and dhura being the principal crops. They are on good terms with their northern neighbours the Beni Matar. They dislike the Arabs of Jebel Reima, and also the Khaulan, whom they fought 12 years ago. With the Beni Muqatil, who are of the Da'udiyah sect and opposed to the Imam, they have a long-standing feud. There is a well-known Seyyid at Dhur'an, their chief town, by name Seyyid 'Ali ibn Isma'il. He was exiled to Rhodes by Ahmed Pasha Feizi, but was pardoned and is now the Imam's representative with the Anis. Paramount Sheikh. 'Ali el-Miqdad. Representative of the Imam : Seyyid 'Ali ibn Isma'il. Other Sheikhs are : A large Shafei tribe with some 3,000 good fighting men, inhabiting the mountains to the east of the Beni 'Abs, with whom they have a feud which is only relaxed when the Idrisi calls on the services of both. N. are the Khamasin ; S. the Beni Nashar ; E. the allied Zeidi tribes of Beni Ghill, Beni Zafir, and Beni 'Aziz. They are separated from the Beni 'Abs by Wadi Ghadir. Chief village : Suq Hariqah. Paramount Sheikh: 'Ali Bedawi of Suq Hariqah. Other Sheikhs: Husein Burt and his brother ' El-Effendi' of Ghadir, and Ahmed Sultan of Suq Hariqah. A small Zeidi tribe south-west of the Beni Husein and Wadi La'ah, and about 50 miles due east of Loheia in the mountains. Their chief Sheikhs are 'Ali Da'am and Husein ibn Hasan. They come under the suzerainty of the Turks, but are said to be discontented with them and with the Imam.

Formerly under the Turkish Markaz of Oufl, but came under the Imam by the treaty of 1911. Good fighters. Noted for their fruits, coffee, and kat. 12. BekTl. See Hdshid wa Bekll. 13. Bur a'. Zeidi tribe living in Jebel Bura', SSW. of 'Ubal. Chief Sheikh is Husein ibn 'Abd er-Rahman el-Bura', who is on unfriendly terms with the Imam, and hates the Turks under whose immediate jurisdiction he is. He is a friend of Nasir ibn Mabkhut of the Hashid. The tribe is allied to the Hufash, Sari, and Mahweit. They are a peace-loving people, numbering about 2,000 men. Yahya 'Abad is the Sheikh ap pointed by the Turks over Jebel Bura', Hajeilah, and 'Ubal. He is about 65 years of age and lives at Hajeilah, which, with 'Ubal, can muster about 400 men. The chief villages are Manwab, Kamah, Fayish, and Rukab. 14. Al Damaj. A small tribe to the E. of the Al 'Ammar, with whom it is generally at feud. Little is known of it except that it is Zeidi and under the Imam. The chief Sheikh is Sa'd ibn Sa'd. The chief Seyyids are 'Ali ed-Damaji and Husein Merza'. The chief clans are Al Wadi (Sheikh 'Abdullah), Al 'Utuf and Al 'Awadah (Sheikh Oahtan Damaji). 15. Gardhih. A small tribe of about 1,000 men settled in Wadi Sardud, whose chief village is Dhahi (Sheikh, Yahya Tzzan). They number 400 fighting men, and their chief Sheikh is Hasan Ahmed es-Sulh. They are under the jurisdiction of the Kaimmakam of Bajil. Their fighting reputation is good : they are hostile to the Beni Suleil and the Ouhrah, their northern and southern neighbours. 16. Beni Ghill. A small Zeidi tribe of Hajur el-Yemen living in Mikhlaf el-Yemene, between the tribes of Beni Zafir on the north and Beni 'Aziz on the south, with whom they are allied. Formerly under the Turkish Markaz of Oufl, but since the treaty of 1911 under the Imam : good fighters. Noted for their fruits, coffee, and kat.224 17. Hajjah. Small Zeidi tribe in and round the town of Hajjah (Hadda). There is a Kaimmakam in Hajjah, so they come under the direct jurisdiction of the Turks, whom they dislike, and against whom they fought in 1911. Since the Imam made peace with the Turks their relations with him have been strained. Paramount Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Hizam. The tribe is descended from Beni Tamlm. 18. Hamdan. There are two sections of the Hamdan, both claiming descent from Qahtan. (a) Hamdan esh-Sham, a very large Zeidi tribe, almost entirely Bedouin, and roaming over the country a day and a half to the north east of Sa'dah. They are bounded on the north by the Yam tribes of Nejran, east by the BekTl, west by Bedouin tribes, and south by Bekil nomads. At present they are on bad terms with the Imam. They are quite independent, and will light for any one who pays them. Chief Sheikh is Sherif Salih ibn 'Ali. They are of the same stock as the Hamdan el-Yemen, but too far off to be in touch. (b) Hamdan el-Yemen. Living to the W. and N. of San'a, chiefly in Wadi Dhahir. They are of the same origin as the Hamdan esh-Sham. Owing to close proximity to San'a, they do not show their real feelings, but are said to dislike the Turks and the Imam, and to have a secret understanding with Nasir ibn Mabkhut of the Hashid. Their chief Sheikh, 'Ali Shawi', is in the pay of the Turks with the rank of mudir. Chief clans : B. Dhurhan (Sherif 'Ali Hamud), B. Beshir (Sheikh 'Alawi), B. 'Afar, B. Dhayyan, B. Harith, B. Meimun (Salih ibn Meimim), B. Jabran. Chief villages ; Mehajir ('Ali Matlaq), Luqamah ('Ali Yahya el-Ham- dani), Tubar ('Ali et-Tubri), Qebil (Ahmed Salamah). 19. Hashdbirah. A small Sunni tribe living a few miles south of the Turkish post of Zeidlyah, east of the Kamaran Islands, and coming under the jurisdiction of 'Abdullah Pasha el-Boni. To their south is the Quhrah tribe. They number between 250 and 300 fighting men, and their chief Sheikhs are Isma'il 'Ali and 'Abdullah Mashhur. Their chief villages are Qariyah, Dar el-Bahri, and Mahal. 20. Beni Hasheish. A Zeidi tribe immediately to the north-east of San'a, living in Wadi Sirr, Wadi Sawan, and down to Jebel Nuqum. They cultivate grapes extensively and also engage in trading. They muster some 1,500 men, but, living so near San'a, possess few rifles. In sympathy they are pro- Imam. Their chief Sheikh is Muhsin el-Jamrah.225 21. Hashid wa Bekll. It is not clearly established whether the Hashid wa Bekll are all of the same descent and therefore one tribe, or a confederation of two tribes of differing origin. The available evidence seems to show that the Hashid trace their descent back to Himyar and the Bekll to Qahtan. Whatever the truth, there is no doubt that their names are commonly linked together by natives in Yemen, that they are on terms of close friendship and have been so for many generations, and that together they form one of the most powerful tribal bodies in Southern Arabia. The home country of the Bekil is to the east in Marashi and Barat, but, as will be seen from the description given below, there are also tribal units living in the midst of the Hashid country and even so far south and west as Hajjah, Wadi Shirs, and Mahweit. The Hashid occupy the country from a few miles north of 'Amran almost to Sa'dah, and to the west they extend almost to Hajur. To the east they are settled in Bilad el-Kharf and round Dhibin, but their nomads wander far afield to the north and towards Barat and Jauf. For many generations the fortunes of the Hashid wa Bekil have been intimately connected with those of the Imams of Yemen ; and this must always be so, both on account of their common creed and because some of the chief strongholds of the Imam, such as Sheharah, Qafilat 'Udhr, and Madan, are set in the midst of the Hashid country. The Imams have drawn largely on the confederation for their fighting material, and in return have rewarded its chief men by governorships in different parts of the country. Thus, before the Ottoman conquest, the chief family of the Himran tribe of Hashid ruled all the country from Najrah to Wadi La'ah and Kaukeban, and the head of the Wada' governed Mikhadir just south of Jiblah. The leading Bekil Sheikhs were equally powerful; and the family of Ausat held the overlordship of Ibb, Suhul, 'Udein, Nadrah, and Ta'izz, while the family of Sha'if were Emirs of Hajjah and Zufeir. The conquest of the Yemen by Mukhtar Pasha in 1872 and the con sequent restriction of the power of these Sheikhs left them with a strong hatred of the Turks and a lasting desire to regain their lost territories ; and the many Yemenite revolts against Ottoman authority during the last forty years have always seen them taking a leading part. They bitterly resented the declaration of peace in 1911, and the Imam's treachery towards Idrisi; and his proposition that they should pay taxes to the Turks caused Nasir ibn Mabkhut, the chief of the Himran and paramount Sheikh of the Hashid, to withdraw his tribes and enter into relations with Idrisi. A truce was arranged in the following year ; but there is still bad feeling between the two which is not likely to cease until the Imam declares definitely against the Turks. The defection of so powerful a body of supporters has of course reacted in favour of Idrisi, who during the last few years has been steadily working to make the feeling permanent. He a. f f226 has, however, to contend against a sentiment of loyalty to the Imam, which has been handed down for many generations, and his lack of ready cash has prevented him from doing more than keep relations between the latter and the confederation strained. He has been in constant touch with its chief Sheikhs for the last few years, and has said that money is the only thing required to bring them on his side. The outstanding figure of the Hashid wa Bekil confederation is Sheikh Nasir ibn Mabkhut. This Sheikh, a man of forcible and ruthless character, has gained almost complete ascendency over the Hashid tribes men and largely influences the Bekil chiefs. He is cruel and unscrupulous, and will join whichever side pays him most. His power is such that, given adequate material help, he can in all probability force the Imam to what terms he likes. No attempt has been made to estimate numbers in the account which follows, but the confederation is said to have put over 50,000 men in the field against the Turks in 1911. A. HASHID The boundaries of the Hashid have already been described. The tribe is largely an agricultural and pastoral one, but certain sections, especially the Himran, are engaged in trade. The most important sub-tribes are the Himran, Dhu 'Udhrah, and Dhu Fari', and most of the tribal policy seems to be guided by Sheikhs Salih ibn Muslih, Salih Ma'id, Mas'ud el-Barak, and Dirhem ibn Yahya, under the direction of Sheikh Nasir ibn Mabkhut. The only sections which have stood out against them and solidly supported the Imam are the Ahnum, Al Ahim, Suleimah, and the southernmost tribes, the Beni Sur' and Arhab. The country of the Hashid is by no means uniformly fertile, and, in consequence, there are many nomad sections. Theoretically taxes are payable to the Imam, but of late years they have mostly found their way into the coffers of Nasir ibn Mabkhut. The Seyyids are very powerful in the Hashid country, Huth being their most important centre in the Yemen after San a and Sa dah. They stand with the Imam, or against him, according to the favours they receive from him. His meanness and par simony seem to have sent the majority into Nasir ibn Mabkhut's camp. The tribes which follow are placed in the order of what is believed to be their numerical and political importance, irrespective of their geographical position. i. Himran Chief Sheikhs : Nasir ibn Mabkhut. Tall, powerfully built, fair-skinned with a small white beard. About sixty. Ambitious and unscrupulous. Rules chiefly by fear. Is rich through taxes levied on his people. His two chief sons are Hamud (age234 24. Hufash. A tribe between Jebel Melhan and Bajil. They are Zeidis and belong to the Imam, though they come immediately under the authority of the lurks, whom they hate. They are allies of their northern neighbours the Sari and Mahweit, and also with the Bura' of Jebel Bura'. Chief Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Yahya. 25. Beni Husein. A small Zeidi tribe just to the NW. of Hisn Jemhnah and west of the Beni 'Udhaqah and Jebel Meswar. Pro-Imam. Sheikh, Ahmed Husein. Formerly under Seyyid Ahmed ibn Mohammed el-Kaukebani, Emir of Kaukeban and the surrounding country. Seyyid Ahmed was defeated by Mukhtar Pasha and died in captivity at San'a. His family, Beit Sheraf ed-I)m, fled to Huth. There is a small Turkish garrison at Hisn Jemhnah. 26. Dhu Husein. The Dhu Husein are a powerful tribe of Sherifial descent inhabiting the fertile oasis of Jauf. Although somewhat isolated by reason of the distance which separates them from the main centres, they have always kept in close political and commercial touch, and have played an important part in the history of the Yemen. Their relations have always been intimate with the Hashid wa Bekil, so much so that they are sometimes spoken of as forming an integral part of that confederation. The troubles between the latter and the Imam have had their effect on the Dhu Husein and drawn them into two opposing camps, of which the larger seems to have remained faithful to its old allegiance. There are several Sheikhs who appear to rank equally in importance. Of these, Sherif Ahmed ibn Husein has always supported the Imam, and gave him valuable help against the Turks in 1911. Sherif Muhsin ibn 'Abdullah is also a trusted friend, and was sent by the Imam to Aden on a political mission in August 1914. Previously he had commanded an army against the Idrisi. The chief opponent of the Imam and a close friend of Nasir ibn Mabkhut is Husein ibn Thawabah. The tribe is noted for its fighting qualities, and its Sheikhs are better educated than is commonly the case in Yemen ; their capital, Matamah, being a well-known centre of learning. The Dhu Husein go in largely for horse-breeding, and own perhaps the best pedigree stock in Southern Arabia. The chief sub-tribes are : Al Thawabah (Sheikh Husein ibn Thawabah); Beni Furyan (Sheikh Suleiman ibn Ahmed); Dhu Ghailan; Al Wajhah (Sheikh Nasir el-Akhram); Dhu 'Akam ; Beni 'Aseyyan ; Beni Hashim.235 27. Beni Isnid'll. A small Shafei tribe in the mountains round Menakhah, numbering about 2,500 souls, and neutral during its siege in 1911. Ihey are now under Turkish domination. They are brave and well armed. Their country is fertile, producing coffee and cereals. 1 he chief Sheikh is 'Ali Muhsin Yahya. The chief clans are : Al Jaradi, Al Jebali, Beni 'Atiyah, Beni Bishr, and Beni Rajab. The chief villages are Masaribah, Jalbein, Jurn Ja'dal, and Jurn 'Arah. 28. J ami'. A Shafei tribe just north of Loheia and east as far as Zahirah, which is their chief village. In 1911 they fought the luiks on behalf of Idrisi, but they are now close allies of Ibn el-Heij of the Wa'zat. The chief Sheikh is Mohammed Zeid, who comes from the Ashraf of Sabia, and is Mudir of Zahirah. He is under his cousin Sherif Hamud, the Kaimmakam of Loheia, who lives at Mutaridh, and governs the Beni J ami' and Wa'zat. 29. Jemtmcih.

Eight years ago the important Sheikh, Seyyid ed-Dahyani, at that time Emir of Sa'dah and district, quarrelled with the Imam and fled to the Beni Juma'ah for protection. Since then he has lived with them and established a firm place for himself amongst them. He is a great friend of Idrisi, whom the Beni Juma ah also support. 31. Kam'dlah.

They have a good fighting reputation, and are allied with the Beni Murran, the Al 'Ammar, and the Sahar in opposition to the pro-Idrisi tribes of Jebel Razah. The Imam has a fortress at their chief village, Saqein, from which his representative and one of his chief military leaders, Seyyid Qasim Seifi, governs the tribes of the district. Here lives also the Paramount Chief, Sheikh Jum'an ibn Safiq.

For 12 years the Makramis held the Emirate of Heima, Haraz, Menakhah and district by gift from the Imam Muhsin, but they were expelled by Mukhtar Pasha in 1872. Their followers who remained behind have little political importance now, and are chiefly engaged in trade. Like the rest of their tribe they are of Isma'illyah sect. In 1911 they fought for the Turks against the Imam. They occupy the villages of Mugharibah, Safiyah, Beit el-Hud, Khiyam, Beit el-Ghail, Beit el-Akhbari, and Qushamin.

They bear no love to the Turks, but on that occasion were glad to receive arms and food from the Kaimmakam of Menakhah in return for their help. They are of the Da'udiyah sect and are markedly hostile to their Zeidi co-religionists, such as the Anls. They muster between 2,400 and 2,700 fighting men, and are allied with the Beni Murrah and Beni Ahlas. 48. Beni Murrah. A small tribe of the Da'udiyah sect, inhabiting with the Muqatil and Beni Ahlas, their allies, the country between Menakhah and Mefhaq. They have no love for the Turks, and equally little for the Imam and239 his followers, whom they fought in 1911. They number about 2,500 souls, and their mountainous country produces coffee and kat.

The principal Sheikh is 'Abdullah Pasha el-Boni of Reighah, whose father was Kaimmakam and very influential. But the Beni Qeis now incline towards Idrisi. They are about 2,000 men. The principal villages are Raighah, Tor, and Musallam. 52. Quhrah. An important tribe on the first stages of the Hodeidah-San'a road from the sea, for about 50 miles E., as far as Hajeilah.

Between the coast and Bajil, 25 miles, the country is mostly desert, and the inhabitants live in temporary huts in the Khabt: but E. of Bajil there is cultivation. The Quhrah own many camels, and transport from Hodeidah to Hajeilah is mainly in their hands. They can put from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the field, and they gave valuable help to the Turks in 1911 when these occupied the Zahab heights. They are generally at feud with the Beni Suleil. The chief Sheikh is Mu'afa Sheraf. Others are Hasan 'Abdullah and Ibrahim 'Ali. The chief villages are : Bajil (Sheikh 'Ayad ibn 'Ali Humeidah), Buhah, 'Ubal, and Hajeilah (Seyyid Husein 'Ali).240 53- Rada'ah. A Zeidi tribe living round the town of the same name ESE. of Dhamar. They are descended from Qahtan, and are chiefly cultivators and traders. Their chief Sheikh is Hamiid ibn Mohammed, who comes under the Turkish mutesarrif of Rada'ah. 54. Rahdminah. A small tribe south-west of Zebid between Zebid and Wadi Suweirah. 55. AM Razah. A Zeidi tribe living round Jebel Razah to the west of the Khaulan esh-Sham and Sa'dah. They are supporters of Idrisi, and their country was the scene of the first fighting between Idrisi and the Imam in 1912. Their chief fortress is Hisn en-Nazir, situated on the slopes of Jebel Razah. The country is fertile, and coffee is largely grown, while there is said to be gold in the mountains. They claim descent from Khazraj, and acknowledge as chiefs Sheikh Ahmed ibn Salih and Seyyid 'Ali ibn Huseini. The chief clan is the Dhu Hatim (Sheikh Sa'd 'Abdullah). Seyyid Yahya 'Arar ibn Nasir, one of Idrlsi's chief muqdamis, administers the country of both the Ahl Razah and the Beni Juma'ah. 56. Ahl Reimah. The Ahl Reimah occupy the fertile Reimah massif, always spoken of by Arabs as the finest district in Yemen. Coffee, fruits of all sorts, and cereals are produced. The district is bounded N. by J. Bura' and Wadi Siham ; E. by Salfiyah and J. 'Utmah ; S. by Wadi Reimah, and W. by the 'Abs and Zaranik districts. The Sheikh is Murshid ibn Mo hammed el-Jabi, who is Turkish Kaimmakam. The Mudir is Seyyid Mahmud. There are said to be seventy Sheikhs and seventy districts in J. Reimah, and a total strength of over 50,000 men. The principal clans are : Beni Waghid, J ad, Sa'id, Walid, Mukhtar, Tuleibi, Mas'ab, Ghuzi, Nomah, Yafuz, Ahl Dalamlam, Beni Harazi, Ahmed, Khudam, Ahl Jabi, and Beni en-Nahari.

His brother, the late Sheikh, \ahya, was defeated by the Turks, and died a captive. This clan is generally on bad terms with the Anis. Principal villages : Jabi (head-quarters of the district and of Sheikh Murshid), Raubat en-Nahari (Suq of Sheikh Murshid), Kusmah, 'Alujah (Suq of Sheikh Mahmud), and Hadlyah, 57. Beni Sa'fan. A tribe in the mountains WNW T . of Menakhah, and separated from it by the Mazar section of the Da'udiyah sect.

He is about 65, an experienced fighter. The tribe is a large one, numbering nearly 10,000 souls. It is generally on bad terms with the neighbouring Shafei, Zeidi, and Isma/iliyah tribes. The chief clans are : Beni 'Ali Yahya and Beni Harun. The chief villages are : Metwah, Za'lah, Ashkar, Jari, Sharaji, Mujwan, and Hijri. 58. Sahdr. The Sahar are a fairly numerous tribe, of which the settled portion lives in and round the town of Sa'dah and is engaged in agriculture and trading. Owing to internal disunion and an absence of tribal feeling it does not possess the political importance which its numbers should warrant. The villagers are all under the authority of the Imam, but the nomads are almost completely independent and are accustomed to range far afield to the North and East in the direction of Nejran and Barat. The tribe keeps on good terms as a rule with its neighbours, the Hashid and the Arabs of Khaulan esh-Sham. 'Ali Ma'wad is the chief Sheikh of the settled portion. Seyyid Ahmed and Qashn el-Hashimi are the representatives of the Imam.

They are Zeidis and under the Imam, but their country is administered by the Turks, whom they hate. Allied with their northern neighbours, the Mahweit, also with the Hufash and Bura'. 60. Senhdn. A small Zeidi tribe stretching from just south of San'a to Meha- qarah and the northern edge of the Bilad er-Ruhus. On the east they are bounded by the Khaulan. They are entirely devoted to cultivation, and number about 700 men. Seyyid Mohammed Sibsib of Mehaqarah is the chief Sheikh. The tribe is loyal to the Imam, who has his repre sentative the Qadhi, Lutf ez-Zubeir, living there. a. h h242 The chief villages are: Na'd, Juzah, Oulfan, Hazyaz, Lubad, Safiyah, Mahaqarah, and Sha'asan. 61. Serbih. Their stronghold is Da'an, 3 hours north of 'Amran. Their chief is Sheikh Rajih, who was granted the grade of Mirmiran before the Constitution and was made Pasha to secure his loyalty, but he remained staunch to the Imam and fought against the Turks in 1911. Peace was signed at Da'an between Tzzet Pasha and the Imam in 1911. 62. A hi Sha'ir. A large and peaceful tribe inhabiting the district round Jebel Sha'ir in southern Yemen. They cultivate kat and cereals in the fertile valley of \\ adi Bana. Their paramount Sheikh is Salih ibn Yahya Hizam, of the Beni Hizam, who comes under the Kaimmakam of Qa'tabah. Sheikh Hajj el-Kabs, of the Beni Kabs, and Yahya el-Qeishi are also important men in the tribe. 63. Shamar. A small Zeidi tribe attached to the Imam, north-east of the Beni Aslam, in Hajur. 64. Shemsdn. A small Zeidi tribe numbering about 1,000 souls, east of the Beni Ghill in Hajur. They pay outward allegiance to the Imam, but are said to favour the Idrisi. Their chief is Seyyid Yahya ibn el-Hadi. 65. Beni Suleil. The Beni Suleil occupy a large area from the coast opposite Kamaran to the foot of the hills below Jebel Milhan. On the north they have the Bu'ajah, Za'liyah, and Beni Qeis, on the east the Beni Qeis, and on the south the Hashabiri, who are perhaps really only one of their sections. The main road, which runs north and south through the Tihamah near the foot of the hills, passes through their country, as well as that of those other tribes mentioned above, and they and the Beni Qeis control the caravan trade going up to the Wadi Maur. Estimates of their numbers vary from 1,500 to 10,000 fighting men. The western part of their territory is desert, but they have a good deal of cultivable land under the foot-hills in the east. The tribe supports the Turks, and their two chief men, 'Abdullah el-Boni and 'Abdullah Kauzi, have each received the title of Pasha and been appointed Kaimmakam of Zeidlyah and Mudir of Kenawuz respec tively. They are friendly with the Wa'zat but independent of them. Towards the Quhrah they are always hostile. Their chief villages are; Zeidlyah (Sheikh 'Ali Nukar), Kenawuz, Ibn 'Abbas, and Salif on the coast. There are important salt-works at the last-named, and a jetty where sea-going ships come alongside.243 66. Ahl el-'Ud. A large and peaceful tribe living about 13 miles north-west of Qa'tabah, and coming under the Turkish Kaimmakam of that place. They live round Jebel Madra, and cultivate kat and cereals in Wadi Bana. Hizam es-Sayadi is their chief Sheikh. 67. Udhdqah. A Zeidi tribe who claim descent from 'Anazah and 'Adnan, and live round Jebel Meswar to the west of 'Amran, where there is a strong fortress at present occupied by the Turks. Their Emir is Seyyid Mohammed ibn el-Hadi, a servant of the Imam. 68. Wa'zdt. The Wa'zat occupy the country to the north of Loheia, which has been the scene of the recent fighting between the Turks and the Idrisi. To the north, Wadi 'Ain and Wadi Warith form the boundary between them and the pro-Idrlsi tribe of Beni 'Abs ; to the east are the Beni Nashar ; to the south their boundary is the Wadi Maur. including Mu'taridh and Ghanamah, but not Zahirah, which belongs to the Beni Jami'. Their chief villages are Mu'luq, near Jebel Tzzan in the district of Jarb, and Deiramshuma, a fortified Turkish post about an hour south of Wadi 'Ain. The paramount Sheikh is Hadi ibn Ahmed el-Heij, a staunch supporter of the Turks who, always anxious to encourage the Sunni opponents of the Idrisi, have made him Pasha and Mudir of the district. He comes second to the Sherif Hamud, one of the Ashraf of Sabia who have seceded from the Idrisi, and who as Kaimmakam of Loheia governs the Wa'zat and their allies, the Beni Jami'. Ibn el-Heij has long been opposed to the Idrisi, and three years ago the Idrisi captured his brother 'Abdullah and still holds him prisoner. With the Beni 'Abs the Wa'zat have an ancient feud. During the Turko-Italian War, Ibn el-Heij wavered in his allegiance and took money from the Italians, but in the past two years he has been most active on the Turkish side. In September 1915 he raided the Beni 'Abs and was wounded. Idrisi retaliated by cutting off his supplies, and Ibn el-Heij, finding him self short of food and his followers beginning to desert, appealed to the Imam for help. The latter sent the discouraging reply that he would send troops if they were fed. The W 7 a'zat are reported to number between 1,500 to 3,000 fighting men. Sheikh 'Ali Ibrahim is the most important Sheikh after Hadi ibn Ahmed el-Heij. 69. Ya'bir. A tribe of the Isma'iliyah sect in the district of Haraz, which sided with the Turks against the Imam in 1911. h h 2244 70. Yam. The Yam tribes form a powerful confederation. They stretch from the northern boundary of the Bekil in Barat up the Wadi Nejran and Wadi Habunah far to the north in the direction of Tathlith and Wadi Dawasir. Joseph Halevy, the only European who has visited their country, found it in 1870 a fertile and productive region inhabited by a well-to-do population. In religion they are Isma'iliyah and are known to the rest of Yemen as the Mu'tazilah or isolated sect; but as Wadi Nejran was the last refuge of Christianity, and has remained far removed from external influence, it is possible that traces of the ancient worship still exist. Halevy was not long enough in the country to verify this, but the tolerance and even favour which he found extended to the Jews in Mikhlaf were hardly in the spirit of strict Mohammedanism. The religious chiefs are probably more orthodox than the bulk of the inhabitants, since they are in communication, not only with the chief Ashraf of Yemen, but with the Agha Khan, their spiritual head. The ruling family is that of Makrami, descended from their famous ancestor who, in the middle of the eighteenth century, preached his reforming Gospel from Nejran to Hasa. About the middle of the nine teenth century they developed ideas of expansion, and obtained from the Imam Muhsin in i860 the Emirate of Heima, Haraz, and Menakhah. Their tenure, however, was short-lived, as in 1872 they were defeated and banished to their own country by Mukhtar Pasha. There is still a small remnant of the tribe, calling themselves the Makarimah, in the Haraz district, who fought for the Turks in 1911 but are chiefly traders and have little political importance. The present Emir of Nejran is Isma/il el-Makrami, who owes no allegiance. His tribesmen, however, are willing as a rule to serve as mercenaries with either the Imam or the Turks, if well paid. They have a reputation for ruthless bravery. Idrisi has been in negotiation with them at various times during the present war, hoping with their help to force the Imam's hand against the Turks ; but up to the present without result. 71. Beni Zdfir. A small tribe of Hajur el-Yemen living in Mikhlaf esh-Shems, which is noted for its fruits, coffee, and kat. Formerly they were counted as in the Turkish Markaz of Qufl, but after the treaty of 1911 between the Turks and Imam they came under the jurisdiction of the latter. They are Zeidis, good fighters, and allied with the neighbouring Zeidi tribes of Beni Ghill and Beni 'Aziz. 72. ZaHiyah. A small tribe immediately to the south of Loheia and the Wadi Maur down to the Beni Suleil. They are independent of the Wa'zat, their245 northern neighbours, and come under 'Abdullah Pasha el-Boni, Sheikh Hadi 'Ali, living at Dar el-Muhannab, is their chief Sheikh. They number 400 men. 73. Zaranik (Dhardniq). A powerful and warlike tribe divided into two sections, the Zaranik esh-Sham and Zaranik el-Yemen, and occupying the country between the sea and the hills from a few miles north of Beit el-Faqih almost to Zebid. The Zaranik have for long been a thorn in the side of the Turks, and especially during the Turco-Italian War. Repeated expeditions have failed to subdue them, but latterly there have been reports that part of the highland section, under Sheikh 'Ali ibn Hamud, have succumbed to Turkish bribes. Mohammed Yahya el-Hibah Fashik, the chief of the lowland section and paramount over the whole tribe, living at Huseiniyah, nine miles north of Zebid, has, however, continued to hold out stoutly. In November 1915 he made common cause with Idrisi in taking active measures against the Turks, and has succeeded in effectually cutting all communications in the Tihamah from north to south. At the beginning of 1916 he was attacked by an irregular force from Mocha, increased by 300 Arabs under the leadership of Abela Effendi, the brother of Elias 'Osman, Kaimmakam of Mocha, but unsuccessfully. In May 1916 he again took the offensive and looted the Turkish serai in Beit el-Faqih. The two most important Sheikhs after Sheikh Fashik, and closely allied with him, are Shami and Munasar Saghir of Kokar, chief of the Highland section. Other Sheikhs, of whom nothing is known save their names, are 'Abdullah Munasar of Huseiniyah, Nasir Jurmush, Isma'il Ahmed, Sheikh of Qaramshah, 'Abdullah Duneidinah of Zebid, Ahmed Risqallah of the Al 'Ali, Hasan Rish of Jiz, Samud of Al Musa, Hasan Mubarak of Umm Faza', and Ibrahim Dhumbi of Direihimi. 74 .Zufeir. Small Zeidi tribe 5 miles north of the Hajjah, with whom they are allied. They come under the Kaimmakam of Hajjah, but are said to dislike the Turks and to have lost confidence in the Imam.SEDENTARY TRIBES OF THE SOUTH ADEN PROTECTORATE i. 1 Abddli. T he Ottoman attack on Aden in July 1915 resulted in the occupa tion of the 'Abdali country by the Turks, the fall and sack of Lahej, its capital, the death of the ruling Sultan, and the retreat of most of his subjects to the Aden lines. Previous to that event the 'Abdali tribe occupied the country immediately round Aden. Its boundaries extended about 35 miles inland to the Haushabi tribe on the North, to the Fadhli Sultanate on the East, and the Subeihi tribe on the West. Formerly it held the Aden peninsula until an outrage perpetrated on a shipwrecked crew and the absence of any satisfaction led to the British bombardment and occupation of Aden in 1839. The Sultan of Lahej, who is the head of the 'Abdali, still receives a yearly subsidy from the British Government for its occupation of the town of Sheikh 'Othman, and leases to it a large area of land in the neck of the isthmus. The present Sultan, 'Abd el-Kerim ibn Fadl ibn 'Ali, is a man of 35, of sedentary habits, who has up to the present shown no marked ability. He is fairly well educated according to Arab standards, but knows no English. He is very popular with the tribe. He succeeded his cousin H. H. Sultan Sir 'Ali ibn Ahmed ibn 'Ali, K.C.I.E., on July 13, 1915, when the latter was accidentally shot during the Ottoman occupa tion of Lahej. The tribe owes its importance more to its wealth than to its military prowess. It is entirely settled and agricultural with the exception of the Ahl Ban, who are chiefly pastoral but have arable land westwards in Abiyan near the Fadhli Sultanate. The population is estimated at 14,500. The late Sultan of Lahej controlled the first stage of the main caravan road from Aden to Yemen up the Wadi Tiban and maintained armed and fortified posts at Zeidah, Sha'qah (Shaka), and 'Anad. He also had a customs post for the Aden traffic at Dar el-Amir. He was then able to put into the field about 2,000 men, who were of doubtful fighting value but strong enough to repel any tribal attacks, knowing that British troops would come to their aid in the event of serious trouble. Sub-Tribe. Ahl Ban. 'Udheibi. Musabein. Mansuri. Clan. Sh. Salih Mansur. 'Ali Mansur. Mohammed Mansur.247 2. 'Ahd el-Wahld Sultanate. The 'Abd el-Wahid confederation lies immediately to the East of the Upper and Lower 'Aulaqi Sultanates, with whose tribesmen it is at constant feud. Tribally it is divided into the Sultanates of Balhaf,Habban, and Izzan. The Sultan of Balhaf, who lives in the town of that name on the sea- coast, is Salih ibn 'Abdullah, who used to be officially recognized at Aden as the head of the 'Abd el-Wahid confederation, and who received a small subsidy from Government. He is well-conducted, anglophile, but without much influence over his turbulent tribesmen. The latter have an heredi tary feud with the Ba Kazim, but lack their resolute grit and hardihood. Passage from one country to the other is dangerous, and supplies from Aden ordinarily come by sea. The Sultan of Habban, the chief mercantile town of the district, is Nasir ibn Salih. He is untrustworthy, and strongly opposed to any European penetration of his dominion. He is unpopular with his tribes men, and frequently has trouble with the Lakmush and Ahl Iswad, two small but turbulent vassal tribes who lie between him and his hereditary enemies, the Ahl Ma'an of Upper 'Aulaqi. The chief of the Izzan Sultanate, which lies 25 miles to the East of Habban, is Muhsin ibn Salih. He is a man of about 45, unpopular with his tribes, a robber, and a bad governor. He was expelled by the tribesmen in the early nineties, and after taking refuge with the Ahl Ma'an, went to Aden, Jibuti, and Hodeidah. Having tried in vain to raise money by pledging his Sultanate in turn to the French and the lurks, he returned via San'a and managed to reinstate himself. In 1898 he again came into disfavour by endeavouring to blackmail the Austrian Expedition. He is now recognized by the Aden authorities as paramount, and receives a subsidy of Rs. 720 per annum. He is also supreme at Balhaf, but shares the dues with Salih ibn 'Abdullah. Officially recognized Sultan, Muhsin ibn Salih of Izzan. Subsidiary Sultans : Nasir ibn Salih of Habban. Tribes : Ahl Iswad. Lakmush. Salih ibn 'Abdullah of Balhaf. 3. Ahl Karab. The Ahl Karab is a nomad tribe ranging the desolate tracts north of Upper 'Aulaqi and penetrating as far west as Beihan el-Jezab and the Musabein country. They are a tribe of marauders and robbers, and though nominally vassals of the Upper 'Aulaqi Sultan, are always at war with the Ahl Hammam. Their chief is Hamid ibn Nasir abu Kateyan, who lives at Shabwah, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, some 55 miles north-east of Nisab, built on the ruins of an ancient Himyarite city. They muster 400 men.248 4. Ahl es-Sa'tdi. The Ahl es-Sa'idi are a small confederation bounded on the North by the 'Audillah, on the East by the Oleh, on the South by the Oleh, and on the West by the Yafa'. They are chiefly to be found near Dakhlah and the Sa'idi plain, and are the original owners of the soil under the tenure of the Sultan of Upper ' Aulaqi, whose influence extends as far as Qarn Murshid. A land- tax is due to him from them, and is always withheld until he comes down to fetch it with a large force. This happens about every five years. The chief 'Aqil is Mohammed 'Ali abu 'Awad, who resides at Nubat es-Suwa, and also holds supreme authority over the Yazid, who pay taxes to him. The confederation numbers about 300 men, and are the nucleus of the following sub-tribes : (1) AHL DIYAN. Living at El-'Ain and Hamra. Their 'Aqil, Nasr Hamid, lives at El-'Ain and receives a small tax from them, but at Thuwarein they pay a far larger tax or 'ushr to Mohammed ibn 'Ali, a chief of the Ahl es-Sa'Idi, whose grand father was formerly 'Aqil on condition of receiving 'ushr from the Ahl Diyan, which was levied on land which they tilled, belonging to the Ahl es-Sa'idi. The 'Aqilship passed from that family, but the 'ushr is still paid. The Ahl Diyan muster about 200 men and are an offshoot of the sub-tribe at Khaura, but may now be considered as a component part of the Ahl es-Sa'Idi Confederacy. (2) AHL YAZID. Living at Dakhlah. They muster about fifty men. There are three more actual subdivisions of the Ahl es-Sa'idi, but they barely muster between them 100 men and are scattered throughout the neighbouring villages in a most confusing manner. There is a settlement within their territory called Hafa, which is peopled by Sadah (or Seyyids), whose origin is from Waht ('Abdali country), where is the shrine of a well-known saint, 'Amr abu ' Ali, who, it is stated, formed a friendship with 'Amr abu Sa'id (now enshrined at Mijdah) and was granted by him a small tax on the land round Dakhlah, which these Sadah collect. It is payable in kind, as are all these ecclesi astical contributions, and is about 5 per cent, on the year's crop. There is a shrine at Hafa (Fatimah bint Ahmed), and its attendants form the balance of the population. 5. 'Aqrabi. A small and peaceably disposed tribe, numbering about 700 souls, ranging north of Aden lagoon and west of Bir Ahmed, the tribal capital. Here is the residence of the local Sultan, the tall mud tower of which can be plainly seen from Aden harbour. The inhabitants are agricultural and pastoral. Their chief is Sheikh Fadhl ibn 'Abdullah Ba Haidarah, who succeeded his father in 1905. He is now about 31 years old, and is said to249 be fairly intelligent. His uncle, 'Ali Ba Haidarah, a shrewd old man of nearly 70, unsuccessfully pressed his claim to the Sheikhship in 1905, but later worked in harmony with the present chief. In the present war pressure from their powerful northern neighbours, the Subeihi, and from the Turks has brought them in temporarily on the side of the latter. Their Sultan is said to be a prisoner in Turkish hands. 6. 'Alawi. A small tribe of 1,200 souls whose chief village is at Suleiq, about 55 miles north of Aden. They live just south of the Quteibi tribe. Sheikh 'Ali ibn Nashir ibn Sha'if, who lives at Kasha', is the present chief. He has the tribe well in hand in spite of the chronic disputes with the Quteibi. A middle-aged man of no particular influence, he was at first loyal and amenable to advice, but for some years his hatred and jealousy of the Quteibi, combined with excessive indulgence in kat, led him into trouble. The animosity between him and the Quteibi finally cooled down and a permanent settlement was effected between them in 1913 by the late 'Abdali Sultan, Sir Ahmed Fadhl. He succeeded to the Chiefship in 1898 and signed an agreement for the safety of the trade routes in July 1914, under which his stipend was raised from Rs. 600 to 1,200 per annum. Early in January 1916 he and his tribe were reported to have submitted with the Quteibi to the Turks and to be marching against the Fadhli Sultan. 7. Amiri. The AmTri is a pastoral and agricultural tribe numbering 5,000 souls and occupying the country round and south-east of Dhala, their capital. The original Emirs of Dhala were Muwallads or half-caste slaves of the Imams of San'a. When the power of the latter was broken up, the Dhala district was in the hands of certain Seyyids, from whom it was seized by the forefathers of the present chief. There has been a long line of Emirs, and since the occupation of Aden by the British these chiefs have been in receipt of a subsidy, except during the period from 1873 to 1878 when the Ottoman Government made a strong aggressive effort to place the district under their own control. By allegiance or conquest several additions have been made to what may be called the district of Dhala proper. These consist of Kharafah, Jebel Harir, the valley of the Suheibiyah as far south as Kaflah, the Dhubayyat hill (only nominal), Sufyan, and Zobeid. The population of the Amiri territory is of a mixed nature. Firstly there are the descendants of the original Amirs, constituting a large clan, although, as at present, not always united; secondly, such Sheiri Sheikhs as are content to acknowledge the authority of the Emir ; thirdly, the various settlers who have from time to time become possessed of land which they cultivate ; fourthly, the ever-present Seyyids or descendants of the Prophet ; and, lastly, a colony of Jews. a. 1 i250 The Emir is Nasir ibn Sha'if ibn Seif, who lives at Dhala. He became Emir in 1911 and is the son of Sha'if ibn Seif'Abd el-Hadi who attended the Delhi Durbar during the Boundary Commission of 1902. He is a man of 36, good-natured but weak and avaricious and of little ability. He has two brothers, 'Abd el-Hamid and Seif, the latter of whom is said to possess a considerable amount of energy and character. The ruling house is unpopular with the tribesmen. When the Turks appeared in 1915 they took from him some fifteen hostages and deprived him of his position. Towards the end of the year they summoned him to Lahej and made a settlement by which they released the hostages, keeping his son in their stead, and reinstated him with the gift of 50 rifles and a subsidy. It is doubtless owing to this that the neighbouring tribes of Quteibi and 'Alawi were coerced into joining them. Sheikh Qasim of Zobeid, who accompanied him to Lahej, received a gift of 10 rifles.

'Audillah. The 'Audillah is a predatory tribe mustering 5,000 fighting men (including 'asakir) and inhabiting the Kaur, the main ridge of the Aden Hinterland. It is bounded on the north by the Beida Sultanate, on the south by the Oleh confederation of Dathinah, on the east by the 'Aulaqi, and on the west by Yafa'. The tribesmen are mainly pastoral, but culti vate sufficient barely for their needs. They hold a weekly market at Laudar, near the south foot of the Kaur, which the neighbouring tribes attend under a mutual understanding of neutrality. Here lives their Sultan, Qasim ibn Hamld el-Ghabir, a man who is powerless to curb their freebooting tendencies, but who provides the only ready channel by which the tribe can be approached. He made overtures for treaty252 'Aulaqi, but maintaining close inter-tribal relations and uniting in the event of any aggression from outside. It extends from the edge of the Ruba' el-Khali to the Aden Gulf, and is bounded on the east by the 'Abd el-Wahid Sultanate and on the west by the Sultanates of Beida, 'Audillah, Oleh, Yafa', and Fadhli. Ihe inhabitants are mainly pastoral and semi-nomadic, but there are large tracts of arable land, while the main wadis all have their settled population. Ihe history of the confederation is as follows : From the Prophet's epoch (or still earlier), the Nisab Sultanate was in the hands of the Umm- Rusas dynasty of Beida, while the whole of Wadi Yeshbum (then called \\ adi Kahai) was under the Sultanate of 'Abd el-Wahid, whose capital was then at Habban. Wadi Yeshbum seems to have then been inhabited chiefly by raya, who paid taxes to the 'Abd el-Wahid dynasty. The Ba Kazim were then confined to Heid Herif (a part of the Utheili system) while Ahwar and district was in the hands of a tribe called the Ahl Zeidi. Soon after the Prophet's death considerable political dissension seems to have occurred in the land of Jauf, where dwelt the remnants of the ancient and powerful Minaean dynasty, which flourished before the Sabean kingdom, owing to the death of the paramount chief, named Ma'an. The house of Ma'an was much persecuted and fled the country, together with two branches of a former ruling chief named Salih, whose descent was as follows : SALIH Nas. A Son (killed in Jauf). Farid. 'Ali. 'Abdullah. These three clans, the Ahl 'Abdullah, Ahl 'Ali, and the Ahl Ma'an, wandered across the outskirts of the Great Desert until they came upon Wadi Yeshbum, where they settled side by side with the raya of 'Abd el-Wahid on the spot where now stand Wasitah and Sa'id. They had, of course, to become raya themselves, as they were aliens under the protection of another Sultanate, and for many years they paid tribute to the Sultan of Habban. In the course of time, however, they increased enormously in numbers, and the Ahl Ma'an left the Wadi and adopted a pastoral and semi-nomadic life in the mountains, leaving the two branches of Manasir Bu Salih still settled in the Yeshbum Valley. About the middle of the sixteenth century these latter became very discontented with their lot owing to excessive taxation, and in a. d. 1590 they persuaded the Ahl Ma'an to join them in an attack on the Umm Rusas dynasty at Nisab, with a view to the annexation of the whole of that district. The Ahl Bunyar, who253 now inhabit the plateau of Dahr but then occupied the Nisab district as well, fought desperately for their Sultan, but could not stand before the rush of the Ahl Ma'an, who were fighting for their very existence as a tribe. The then representative of the Umm-Rusas dynasty at Nisab fled for his life, and the Ahl Bunyar were chased up Wadi Khaura with great slaughter. The Ahl 'Abdullah received the Sultanate, and from them the present Sultan is descended. Many of the Ahl Ma'an settled in this new Sultanate, as will be shown later on when considering the distribution of the various sub-tribes. The remainder returned to their pastoral life near Wadi Yeshbum, the Ahl 'Ali going back to their settlements in the wadi. The Ba Kazim now realized that this alien race was becoming a formidable power, and having also views of expansion, sent a deputa tion to the Ahl 'Ali asking for their assistance in wresting Ahwar from the Zeidi, offering them the Sultanate of that district. A famous diplomat and ascetic. Sheikh Abeid, whose name is still revered in both Upper and Lower 'Aulaqi, arranged the treaty between the two parties. It was agreed that the Ba Kazim should have three- quarters of the arable land at Ahwar and the Ahl 'Ali the other quarter, the latter receiving the Sultanate. In the attack on Ahwar the Zeidi were completely defeated. Some tendered their submission, and are there to this day as mere tributary raya, and the rest fled towards the north-west, and no trace of them remains, although it is said that a small colony of them are settled at Jauf. The Ba Kazim then spread all over the country now known as Lower 'Aulaqi, but never seem to have submitted to the suzerainty of their nominal Sultan, whose dynasty they regarded as aliens whom they themselves had pitchforked into power. After the Ahl 'Ali had left Yeshbum, one of the two divisions of the Ahl Ma'an abandoned their pastoral life and settled in the wadi. 1 his was the Ahl 'Ali Bu Hamid, the other division, the Ahl Mohammed Bu Hamid, still following their nomadic life in the mountains. 1 he Upper 'Aulaqi Sultan is Salih ibn 'Abdullah, who lives at Medak, a short distance from Nisab. He is a man of about 55, energetic and with considerable influence over the tribes. He was a signatory by proxy of the Aden 1 reaty in 1904, and has maintained his anglophile attitude during the present war by refusing to join the Turks in their attack on Aden. His descent is as follows : (AHL 'ABDULLAH) 'A wad A bu ' A bdullah (the last Sultan who visited Aden). ^ r ^ ^ 1 Hamid. 'Abdullah. Sakkaf. Umm Rusas. Salih ibn 'Abdullah.254 His tribesmen are inclined to be predatory, and although he does not give his official sanction to their raids, he nevertheless connives at them and generally receives some of the plunder in an unostentatious manner. At the same time he keeps a firm control over his subjects, and only permits measures to be taken against turbulent and aggressive tribes whom it is necessary to punish. The 'Audillah are always blockading the roads through his country, and the Ahl Ueman have an evil reputa tion for acts of violence and oppression perpetrated on petty traders. The Elhin and the Ahl Diyan are similar offenders. The ethics of such measures are, of course, doubtful, but it can at least be said that many tribes and sub-tribes abstain from predatory acts, deterred by the fear of bringing wholesale ruin and disaster on themselves and their fellow tribesmen. The two chief tribes are the AHL MA'AN and the AHL MEHAJIR. The Ahl Ma'an, with the exception of a large detached section, the Ba Thuban near Wadi Khaura, east of Nisab, inhabit the fertile valley of Yeshbum and its surrounding hills. They are noted for their bravery and fighting qualities, and can muster about 5,000 fighting men. Their ruling family is the Farid; its present representative, Muhsin ibn Farid. He is a man of about 45, and has always been anglophile. He signed the Aden Treaty in 1903, and was granted a stipend of Rs. 1,440 per annum. He succeeded his elder brother Erwes, who was deposed by the tribes in about 1895 for intriguing with the then Sultan of Habban, Muhsin ibn Salih, and committing them to the sack of Habban, a venture which they refused to undertake. His family is as follows : (AHL MA'AN) N asr Umm Dheb Abu Bekr Farid. (killed at Seilan). (killed at Lahej). ih. Umm Moham- Abu Muh- Abdul- Rusas med. Bekr. sin lab. (present Aqil). Erwes Alawi. Nasr. Salim. Hamid. Sa (deposed). Yeslum (imprisoned 1 for some time Hamid. Umm Dheb. at Izzan). The Ahl Mehajir have no paramount chief. They can raise about 4,000 fighting men, but their strength is not concentrated like that of the Ahl Ma'an. They lead a more nomadic life, and range the country from the northern boundary of the 'Audillah and the Kaur el-'Aud to the desert stretches north of the Nisab and the wild country of the Ahl Karab and the Musabein. who pay a nominal allegiance to the Sultan of Upper 'Aulaqi, but are ever swift to raid his tribesmen when an opportunity occurs. The most northern section of the Mehajir, the Ahl Hammam, are255 themselves inclined to be predatory, and scour the Hammam Desert on the look-out for caravans. When the depredations become too frequent and obtrusive, the Sultan of Nisab marches his troops into their country and quickly restores order, dealing out condign punishment on any raiding parties met with. The Hammam 'Aqil, Husein abu Ahmed, has not much control over his people and cannot check marauding. In addition to his own tribesmen, the Sultan exercises suzerainty over the following : 1. The BAL HARITH, who pay immediate allegiance to the Sherif of Beihan, who in turn is under Nisab influence and pays a private, semi-voluntary tribute. 2. The MUSABEIN, merely nominal. 3. The AHL KARAB, also nominal. 4. The AHL SATDI, who pay him land tax under pressure. A further description of the above will be found under their names. 5. The AHL NASIYlN, who derive their origin from the almost extinct race of Beni Hilal, a few surviving representatives of which may be found at Heid Hadhinah. They number 700 men, and their territory stretches from Hajar to Heid Jehur and towards the south-east. Its limit occurs at Jaul (or Jal) Heirur, and may be said to lie along the Wadi Markhah within the limits named. The Sultan is Nasr abu Thalib, who belongs to the Abu Thalib dynasty, an offshoot of the Nisab dynasty. His sway is, of course, subject to the jurisdiction of Nisab. 6. Three clans who are termed 'ASAKIR. They do not come directly under the Sultan, but are bound by treaty with the Ahl Ma'an to give their services in battle in case of a war. (a) Ahl Ba Zal, leading a pastoral life in the Kaur el-'And near the source of Wadi Marbun. (b) Ahl Wahar, living at Heid Keneb and Hisn Makusrah, agri cultural. (c) Ahl Reid, who occupy a district north-east of Arq (the frontier village of Lower 'Aulaqi). They lead a pastoral life along the banks of the Wadi Reid, which joins the Wadi Rafal just above Arq, under the name of Wadi Maleik. 7. AHL BA FEYYAD, a powerful tribe, who are not related to the Ahl Ma'an, but are bound to them by a mutual offensive and defensive alliance. They muster 600 men and live along Wadi Yeshbum, between Safal and the gorge of Nakabah. Origin not known. 8. AHL BA HAD AH, another treaty tribe of the Ahl Ma'an, who number 300 men and extend from below the Nakabah gorge to within a short distance of Habban. 9. KHALlFAH, a treaty tribe living on the western slopes of Heid Hadhinah, a range to the west of the Hammam Desert, and mustering about 1,000 men.256 The fighting strength of the Sultan, including his 'Asakir or standing army, is as follows : Troops at Medak, Nisab, Wadi Dhura, Wadi Abadan (or Abdan), \\ asat, and Beihan ..... 1,100 Ahl Ma'an and Treaty Tribes .... 4,900 Ahl Mehajir and Nasayin ..... 4,400 10,400 In case of a great emergency the Sultan would, as suzerain, secure the services of the desert tribes lying east and north-east of the Hammam as far as human life can be supported in the desert. The Beihan tribes would join as a matter of policy, for they are too close to escape being crushed by the fall of the 'Aulaqi dynasty. The people of Jauf would certainly throw in their lot with the 'Aulaqi, for it has always been the policy of the Nisab Sultans to keep in touch with the parent tribeship, and Jaufi chiefs are often entertained at Nisab. The Khalifah of Hadhinah would also come forward, as a serious reverse to Upper 'Aulaqi would cut them off from all their trade routes to Nisab, Yeshbum, and Habban. Lower 'Aulaqi would follow the lead of the Ahl Ma'an, as between Umm Rusas abu Farid and 'Ali abu Muhsin, the paramount chief of the Ba Kazim, there is firm friendship and also a defensive treaty. Only in the case of aggression against the 'Abdali Sultan would the Ba Kazim keep out, there being a close alliance between 'Ali abu Muhsin and the 'Abdali Sultan. If the position of Dathinah is considered, it will be seen that the Oleh confederacy must join in or be annihilated, and besides, their sympathies are with the 'Aulaqi. Under such circumstances the forces may be estimated as follows : Upper 'Aulaqi ...... . 10,400 Lower 'Aulaqi ...... 4,800 Jauf and tribes between them and Beihan . . 12,000 Beihan ....... 6,000 Desert tribes, Ahl Karab, &amp;c. 8.000 Khalifah of Hadhinah .... 0 0 q H Oleh of Dathinah ..... • 3,200 45,400 The Ahl Bunyar, who number about 4,000, are excluded, as they would follow the Beida Sultan, and some tribes, whose forces are not known, are also omitted. The supply of breech-loading rifles amongst those tribes has increased enormously during the last few years, and they have some good mounted troops. Their military spirit is undeniable, their history for the last century being full of martial episodes.257 The Ba Kazim with its numerous subdivisions compose the entire tribal population of Lower 'Aulaqi, and can put into the field about 5,000 men. They are a hardy and turbulent race, always engaged in petty feuds amongst themselves, or raids on their immediate neighbours, the 'Abd el-Wahid, Fadhli, and Oleh. They have a bad reputation with the other tribes on account of their fondness for drink and their slackness in religious observances, but are redeemed by their genuineness and bravery. They have no paramount chief, such influence as the tribe will permit being exercised by the brother chiefs of the Ahl 'Ali section at Ghidabah, Fadhl, and 'Ali Muhsin. The late Sultan of Lower 'Aulaqi, Bu Bekr ibn Nasir, lived at Ahwar, about five miles from the coast, and had very little influence over the Ba Kazim tribesmen. His successor has not yet been appointed. UPPER 'AULAQI A hl M a'an Ahl 'Ali abu Hamid. Wadi Yeshbum from Wasitah to Safal, 2,200. Tribe. A hl B u B ekr A hl A tik Nos. 1,000 500 Clan.

The Beida is a plateau Sultanate north of the Kaur, impinging on the Yemen along its western boundary and reaching northwards to Beihan ed-Daulah. To the east is the Upper 'Aulaqi Confederation and on the south the 'Audillah. Formerly its power was more wide-reaching, and in the Prophet's time, or even earlier, all the land round Nisab was in the hands of the Umm Rusas dynasty of Beida and his chief tribe, the Ahl Bunyar. This they held until the year 1590, when they were forced back up the Wadi Khaura and to the Dahr plateau by the Ahl Ma'an and other tribesmen who now form the Upper 'Aulaqi Confederation. The Sultan resides at Beihan Umm Rusas, and can muster about 1,000 men of his own retainers and 'asakir. An unsuccessful attempt was made some years ago to enter into relations with him. He still stands out from treaty relations with us and is in correspondence with the Imam. The principal tribe is the Ahl Bunyar, occupying Soma (or Sauma'ah) and the Dahr plateau. Their chief is 'Abd en-Nebi Husein, who lives in the fortress of Dhimrah, which guards the thriving trading town of Soma from attack. He is a man of about 50 years and carries his influence beyond his borders to the 'Audillah and Upper 'Aulaqi tribes. He commands some 4,000 men. Farther north come the tribe of the Beni Yub, who used to exact customs dues on the Beihan Jezab and Yeshbum caravan road until prevented by the Ahl Hammam. They range along Wadi Markhah and up to Rahwat er-Ribbah. The Ahl Azan, the third chief tribe, are chiefly pastoral, with the exception of the Ahl 'Omar, who are a trading and agricultural community.

Beihan. Beihan is the name given to the district adjoining Wadi Beihan from the point where it leaves the mountain system of Beida down to the region where it loses itself in the Great Desert. Commencing from the upper reaches, the land on both sides of the wadi is in the hands of the Beida Sultanate. Farther down are the limits of the Musabein, chief town Hajarah. Below them the Sultan of Nisab has some land, and263 farther down are the tribal limits of the Bal Harith, in which are the towns of Durb, Hakaba, and Seilan ; the two latter belong to the Ashraf of Beihan, and Dnrb belongs to a large and influential family of Sadah. The above towns have also a large population of ray a, 01 tiading classes, all of whom pay taxes to the Sultan of Upper 'Aulaqi. 1 he Ashraf and Sadah also pay a private semi-voluntary tribute (Jibar) to him, and he exercises considerable influence in the district. The position of these Ashraf requires some explanation ; they are descended as follows . Emir Husein abu El-Qeisi Hamid. Khalid (ruled in W. Saba near Mareb). 'Alawi (ist Emir of Mareb). I Muhsin. El-'Utcir. Hamid (present Emir of Harib). Leshrab. I Hasan. Hjisein abu 'Ali (present Emir at Seilan). Muqbil. El-Jabili. El-Barak. 1 . Muhsm. Ahmed ibn Muhsin (present Emir at Hakaba). Nasr (ruled in Jauf). Muhsin. Husein Ibn 'Abd er-Rahman 'Abd er-Rahman (present Emir of Mareb) adopted son and nephew of Husein. The chief Emir at Beihan is Ahmed ibn Muhsin of Hakaba, who also resides at Beihan el-Jezab. He is an old man of about 67, crafty, but less powerful than he pretends. He is comparatively wealthy, enter tains lavishly, and is very popular with the Bal Harith, among whom he lives for a great part of the year as a Bedouin, in the lower reaches of Wadi Beihan. He acts as an abitrator and dispenses justice. As regards his outside relations, he is on bad terms with the Sherif of Mareb. He has always been anglophile and signed the Aden Treaty in i9 0 3- More recently he has expressed anxiety to extend the British sphere of influence northwards over Beida, Mareb, and Jauf. The Sheikh of the Bal Harith is Shammakh ibn Ghannam, a middle-aged man who visited Aden in 1904 and confirmed the treaty concluded with Ahmed ibn Muhsin in the preceding year. Neither he nor any of the Ashraf have any influence with the Musa- bein. The Bal Harith, Sadah, and Ashraf number together 2,000 men. The Musabein are said to muster more than 4,000 men. Ihe sand dunes which surround Beihan on three sides prevent anything in the nature of a cavalry dash for raiding purposes, but marauding parties (especially from the Hammam), frequently slip through on saddle-camels and play havoc with the Musabein. The Bal Harith and their Sadah and Ashraf are, however, never molested.264 13. Dhdmhari. A small tribe north of Aden, about 40 miles east of the Haushabi, whose Sultan claims suzerainty over them, a claim which they only admit when it suits them. They have always given trouble, and in 1903 a British column meted out punishment to them for raiding the mail, and destroyed their fortress at Nakhlein. The chief Sheikh is Salim Husein. They are reported to have recently joined the Turks. 14. Fadhli. The Fadhli are a large and warlike tribe, numbering about 8,000 fighting men, who are probably well-armed owing to their large sea board and resources. They are pastoral and agricultural, and extend from Maqatln (the Lower 'Aulaqi boundary) to the Fadhli border and British frontier line at Tmad, where the tribeship is a mere coastal strip and uninhabited. To the north is the Oleh confederation, over whom the Sultan claims a suzerainty, which is not admitted. In actual practice his power does not extend inland of the maritime ranges. The Sultan is Husein ibn Ahmed, resident at Shughrah (Shuqrah). He is an old man of 90, and in 1877 was deported to India and confined in the fort of Ahmednagar for 9 years, having been implicated in the murder of his brother Heidlyah, who was then Sultan. Heidiyah was succeeded by Sultan Husein's son, Ahmed ibn Husein. The latter died in 1907, after giving much trouble to the authorities, and Husein was proclaimed Sultan. He is unpopular with his subjects, and his grandson 'Abdullah Din ibn Ahmed has greater influence and is anxious to supplant him. He has a son aged 31 named 'Abdullah ibn Husein, who acted for him during his absence in Delhi at the Durbar in 1911, and again in 1913 when he visited Jerusalem. Sultan Husein visited Aden late in 1915, after wards returning to Shughrah. In January of this year he was summoned to Lahej and received by 'Ali Sa'Id Pasha with much honour. After remaining there for some time he returned to Shughrah and reopened correspondence with Aden, claiming to have been compelled by force majeure to visit Lahej. His subsidy has been withheld and an embargo been placed on Shughrah. He has been ordered to Aden to state his case, but it is not expected that he will comply until the situation is clearer. The Fadhli Sultan is in a favourable position, owing to the con vergence of several caravan routes from the northern and eastern districts, to collect onerous transit dues and hamper traffic generally. The cadets of his house in Abiyan, which owes its fertility to W. Bana and other streams between the Fadhli and Aden, have always been independent of him, and bleed the unfortunate traders a second time before they can pass.

The Haushabi are a powerful tribe extending from Dareijah to Nubat Dakim, and controlling the Yemen caravan road along the Wadi Tiban, north of the 'Abdali territory. They claim suzerainty over the Dhambari, which that tribe admits only when it suits them. They are agricultural and pastoral and number about 6,000 souls. The capital is Musemir, a town 60 miles north of Aden, situated on a small plateau overlooking the left bank of the Wadi Tiban. The Sultan 'Ali ibn Mani threw in his lot with the Turks when they appeared in 1915, and accompanied them south in their attack on Aden. He is said to be under the influence of Mohammed Nasir Muqbil of Mawiyah. He had always shown signs of weakness and irresolution, and although his conduct improved just before the war broke out he had the misfortune to be in the hands of ill-disposed and irresponsible advisers, of whom the chief is Fadl ibn 'Ali Humadi. 16. Hajariyah. The Sheikh of this district is Ahmed Na'man, formerly a tax-farmer and made a Kaimmakam by the Turks. He maintains a Zeidist levy of 500 men, and raised a larger force to help the Turkish expedition against Aden. Sub-Sheikhs under his influence attacked us at Sheikh Sa'id late in 1914. Early in 1915 he attacked Sh. Mohammed Hasan, the chief of a religious fraternity at Jebel Habashi, near Ta'izz, for refusal to pay tithe. More lately he has been reported to have been killed and succeeded by his son Mohammed, who was formerly A.D.C. to the Commandant of Ta'izz, and is said to be energetic and anti-British. 17. Quteibi. A small tribe, about 50 miles north of Aden, whose head-quarters are at Dhi Hajarah. The Sultan of the Amlri, who rules immediately to the north, claims suzerainty over them, but cannot enforce it, nor do they admit the claim. The tribe rebelled in 1903 and a British expedition was sent against them. Their Sheikh, Mohammed Salih el-Akhram, nursed a grievance about this for some years, but was eventually won over. He has not much influence over a restless and quarrelsome tribe. He was at odds with the 'Alawi until 1912, when the 'Abdali Sultan effected a reconcilia tion. The real power lies with his nephew Sheikh Muqbil 'Abdullah, who has always been an unreliable factor. Sheikh Mohammed Salih endeavoured to remain neutral when the Turks advanced in 1915, and as late as November in that year wrote to the Resident at Aden, saying that the Turks were exercising pressure on him, and that he was afraid l 1266 of invasion. He was still holding out in March 1916, but his nephew had been to Lahej to treat and temporize with the Turks. 18. Mdwiyah. 1 he Sheikh of Mawlyah, Qa'tabah, and Shurman is Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, a powerful chief on the Yemen boundary, whose influence extends Irom Qa'tabah to Sheikh Sa'Id on the west, and south-east to the Haushabi country. He was originally a tax-farmer, whom the Turks made Kaimmakam of Shuiman and Ivama Ira. He opposed us in 1901 and, after an initial success against the Haushabi, was defeated by a British column which blew up his fortified tower at Dareijah. On our protest to the Ottoman Government he was officially degraded as scape goat, but was promoted later. In February 1915 he signed an agreement with the Resident at Aden, agieeing in return for a subsidy to expel the Turks and recalcitrant chiefs from the Liwa of Ta'izz. Subsequently he joined the Turkish advance, bringing with him his permanent levy of 500 Feidis and some fighting men from the neighbouring tribes. Latterly he has been reported as being at Lahej with the Haushabi. 19. Musahein. A wild semi-nomad tribe between the country of the Sherif of Beihan who has no influence over them, and the Bal Harith tribe. Their head quarters are at Hajarah and they range east to the Ahl Karab country. 1 hey are nominally vassals of the Upper 'Aulaqi tribe, but are on bad terms with the Ahl Hammam, who frequently send small raiding parties against them through the difficult sand dune country which surrounds them. They are said to have 4,000 men. 20. Oleh. The Oleh are a powerful confederation of tribes, descended from a chief of that name, in a district known as Dathinah, which, however, only occupies the centre of the confederation. Its limits are rather vague. The boundaries of the confederation are, on the north Upper 'Aulaqi on the south the Marqushi (Markashi) section of the Fadhli Confederation on the east Lower 'Aulaqi, and on the west and north-west the 'Audillah,' with whom they have an hereditary feud. The y number about 3,000 fighting men of good material, but undis- cu -f! . lacklng cohesion - They have no paramount chief, but Sheikh Ah ibn 'Alawi of the Elhin, who claims descent from the common ancestor, Oleh, influences tribal policy to a certain extent. He has the right to adjust disputes between any tribes of the confederation There are three main family divisions of the Oleh, their family names being at the present time merely abstract titles denoting the branch Irom which each tribe was originally descended. They are the Ahl Ba the Ahl Arman . an d the Ahl Sa'id. The Ahl Ba Leil are the most269 by the Maktari, Sharjabi, Athwari, and other tribes under Turkish suzerainty. Of all the tribes in the vicinity of Aden the Subeihi approach most nearly to the typical Bedouin in character. True Children of the Dawn as their name by some is said to imply, they by preference select that hour for their attacks on wayfarers. They are divided into a large number of petty clans, and there is no paramount chief. Except for some arable land near Umm Rija, they pay little attention to agriculture, nor do they engage in commerce to any extent. Many members of the tribe, however, earn a livelihood by becoming ' muqaddams ', or leaders, of caravans from other districts which pass through the Subeihi country en route for Aden. On account of their frugal diet, which consists of little else than ' jowari they are very spare in frame, but possess great powers of endurance and have a high reputation for courage, unfortunately blemished by their character for treachery. In conse quence of their poverty, few of them own camels, none horses, but the camels in the district are considered equal in speed to the latter animal, in consequence of the great attention which is paid to their breeding. They were placed under the sovereignty of the ' Abdali in 1881, but overthrew his control and resumed their old position of independent relations with the Residency in 1886. Agreements were made with the Dubeini, Mansuri, Makhdumi, and Rujei subdivisions of the tribe, whereby, in consideration of a monthly allowance, the traffic passing through their districts was freed from transit dues and protection granted to travellers. They were one of the first tribes to join the Turks in 1915 and took part in the attack on Lahej. Sub-Tribe. Mansuri Clan. Bruhlmi Bureimi Dubeini 'Atifi Jereiwi Mashaki 'Aweida Sheikh.

The Confederation of Upper Yafa' is situated to the NE. of Aden, and is bounded by the Lower Yafa' Sultanate on the south, the Beida and 'Audillah on the east, and the Amlri and Dhambari on the west. The inhabitants are warlike and hardy mountaineers, always ready for active service, which they seek in different parts of the world. As a confederation they lose power owing to the lack of cohesion and a uniform policy and the personal ambition of the different Sultans. Like many other tribes in the south of Arabia, they were formerly subject to the Imams of San*a. The tribe is called after their ancestor ' 'Afif'. Although known as 'Upper Yafa'' in English, the confederation is called in Arabic Yafa' es-Sufla, or ' Lower Yafa' The rightful Sultan of Upper Yafa' is 'Omar Qahtan, who succeeded his father in 1913, but was expelled by the tribe for coming to Aden to make a treaty with us, as they were jealous of his selection. He belongs to the Dhubi section, though originally of the house of Sheikh 'Ali Har- harah. He was opposed by his brother, Salih ibn 'Omar, and, despite English influence, failed to get himself reinstated. The Government accordingly refused to recognize him as Sultan and gave him a year within which to271 bring about his rehabilitation. They, however, continued to pay the stipend received by his father, Qahtan, who was a man of little influence and in his later days an exile from his capital. His brother Salih ibn 'Omar, who is a man of much stronger character, was recognized in 1911 by the Maflahis as their Sultan and receives tribute from Rub'atein. There are four chief tribes : the Mausata, Maflahi, Sheibi, and Dhubi. The Sheikh of the Mausata is Muhsin 'Askar. He is a man about 75 years old and comes of a family of intriguers, but wields undoubted influence. He signed the treaty with the Bombay Government in 1904 as joint signatory with his brother 'Ali 'Askar. The latter died in 1907 and was succeeded by his son Naji' 'Ali 'Askar, but most of the power has remained with his uncle Muhsin 'Askar. The Sheibi are the most northerly tribe of the Confederation and impinge on Ottoman territory towards the Bana. Their Sultan is 'Ali Mauna es-Sakladi. The Sheikh of the Dhubi is Salim Salih ibn 'Atif Jabir. He is a stipendiary and his predecessor was the first Upper Yafa' Sheikh to conclude a treaty with us (1903). Two other stipendiaries of this section are the brother Sheikhs Mohammed and 'Omar ibn Muthanna ibn 'Atif Jabir. The latter has little influence and has not justified his selection as stipendiary. He is grasping and a master of intrigue. Rub'atein is an appanage of the Dhubi tribe. The three principal Sheikhs are Yahya ibn 'Askar, Salih ibn Ahmed, and Yahya Nasir. Before the war they were all fearful of Turkish intrigue and desired closer relations with the British Government. Another important tribe is that of the Maflahi, whose chief is' Abd er- Rahman ibn Qashn. He is a stipendiary and has always been a well-wisher of the English. His residence is at Jurba. The conduct of the Upper Yafa' Sheikhs has not been entirely satisfactory lately. Some of the non-stipendiary Sheikhs have long resented their exclusion from the list of recipients of doles and have turned to the Imam of San'a. The descent of the Turkish forces opened an avenue for securing loot and monetary consideration from Sa'id Pasha. The stipendiaries have been outwardly loyal, but there is evidence to show that some sort of secret understanding exists between them and the transborder Arabs. A section of the Mausata have actually gone over to the enemy, and the rest will follow where they think that their interest leads them. Trihe. M ausata UPPER YAFA' CONFEDERATION Chief. Clan.

The district of Lower Yafa' is inhabited by the Beni Qasid tribe. Their late Sultan, 'Abdullah ibn Muhsin, who died early in 1916, was a man of eccentric habits and disliked both the British and the Fadhli. The newly elected Sultan is as yet an unknown quantity, but is said to be Turkophobe. His tribes are out of hand and several have addressed themselves to Aden asking to know the policy of the Government. They have long been at variance with the Fadhli and a short time ago were in danger of having their supplies cut off from Shughrah. Sa'id Pasha, however, intervened and succeeded in arranging a three months' truce between them.HADHRAMAUT i. Akdbarah. A small nomad tribe, descended from Himyar, along the sea-coast west of Makalla and between Makalla and the Beni Hasan. They number 500 fighting men. 2. 'Amiidi. A nomad tribe which was formerly powerful and owned the Wadi Do'an almost up to Meshed. They were almost annihilated about 15 years ago by the Sultan of Makalla. The survivors, numbering only about 150 men under Sheikh Salih ibn 'Abdullah, are still suffered to live in the Wadi Do'an. 3. Awdhthah. An independent nomad tribe of Himyar, living in Wadi'Ain, south-east of Haurah. Their chief Sheikh is 'Abdullah ibn Ahmed and they number about 2,000 men. They are allied with the Seiban and with them main tain a continued warfare with the Hamumi. The chief families of Ashraf are the Ahl Ba Wazir and Beni Sheiban. Paramount Sheikh, 'Abdullah ibn Ahmed.

A powerful and warlike Bedouin tribe, north-west of the Nu'a and Dein, living in the country round Shura and Wadi 'Irmah and ranging the country north to the Empty Quarter. They possess many horses and were of great assistance to the Nu'a in their fighting against Ghalib ibn 'Awad el-Ka'aiti, Sultan of Makalla. They can muster from 8,000 to 10,000 men under Thabit ibn 'Omar, their Paramount Chief. 7. Hamumi. A strong and warlike nomad tribe descended from Himyar in the country north of Makalla. They are entirely independent, can put nearly 10,000 men in the field and are always at war with the Sultan of Makalla, the Awabthah, and the Seiban. Their chief Sheikh is Sheikh Halreish. The principal sub-tribes are Beit Jerzat, Beit 'Ali, and Beit Sa'id. 8. Beni Hasan. A small nomad tribe descended from Himyar, and numbering 200 men, in the country along the coast between the Mohammedin and the Akabara west of Makalla. 9. Jabiri (pi. Jawdbir). A strong nomad tribe, south of Seyyun, having a defensive alliance with the Kathiri and paying a nominal allegiance to the Sultan of Seyyun and Terlm. 10. Jada.

Beni Shemlan. Ibn Shemlan. Beni Humeid. Beni Madhi. 11. Kathiri. The Kathiri tribe is one of the most warlike and powerful tribes in the Hadhramaut and is the chief menace to the ever-increasing power of the Sultan of Makalla. They are partly settled and partly nomad, and occupy the country between Terlm and Seyyun, their chief towns, almost up to the Sultan of Makalla's frontier city of Shibam. The feud between the two arose in the early seventies of last century and has ever since dominated the politics of the Hadhramaut. At that time the Kathiri Sultan of Seyyun borrowed three lakhs of rupees from the head of the Ka'aiti family, and afterwards repudiated the debt. Recourse was had to the Political Resident of Aden, and after arbitration had proved abortive, Shiheir and Makalla, then in the possession of the Kathiri275 Sultan, were bombarded by a British ship and handed over to the Ka'aiti. Since then there has been an increasing feud which has at times led to actual warfare. 1 he present Kathiri Sultan is Mansur Kathiri, a man who has been unable to enforce his will on his independent tribesmen ; the latter are said to number 10,000 to 15,000 fighting men, and with their allies the 'Awamir, Tamimi, and Jabiri, who can put into the field another 5,000 warriors, they form a very powerful confederation. Like all tribal confederations, however, jealousies and an innate independence prevent them from making full use of their power. 12. Mandhil. A warlike and independent nomad tribe, roaming the country to the north of the Hamumi, numbering between 5,000 and 6,000 men. They are allied to the Hamumi in opposition both to the Seiban and the Sultan of Makalla. 13. Mohammedln. A small nomad tribe, numbering 300 men, between the Nu'a on the west and the Beni Hasan on the east. They trace their descent to Himyar. Sa'id ibn Suleiman is their Sheikh, living at Haseisah, the main tribal centre. 14. Nahad. The Nahad are a Bedouin tribe, descended from Kindah, numbering from 3,000 to 4,000 men and occupying the country due north of Haurah. They are on friendly terms with the Sultan of Makalla's representative at Haurah, but are bitter enemies of the powerful tribe of Sa'ar to their north. Their Paramount Chief is Sheikh ibn Minif. 15. Nu'a. The Nu'a are a Bedouin tribe, descended from Himyar, with head quarters round the valley of Wadi Hajar. They are bounded on the west by the tribes of the 'Abd el-Wahid Sultanate, on the north-west by the Dein and Al Hamim tribes, on the north by the Numan, and on the east by the Seiban and Mohammedin. Between Bir 'Ali and Haseisah they come down to the sea. They cultivate dhura and wheat in Wadi Hajar and raise dates, but their chief wealth is in camels, of which they are said to possess about 6,000, and in sheep and goats. The Sultan of Makalla cast covetous eyes on their possessions and for 12 years strove to wrest the Wadi Hajar from them. He met with no success, and two years ago relinquished his attempts and made peace. The Nu'a can put from 5,000 to 6,000 men in the field, all armed with rifles. Their chief Sheikh is Ahmed ibn Oadim, who lives at Lubnah, a man of about 45, strong and well liked by his tribes. He keeps on good terms with the Sultan of Balhaf and with the Dein, and is allied with fhabit ibn 'Omar, the chief of the Al Hamim, who helped M m 2276 him in his war against the Sultan of Makalla. The Ashraf are strong in the district, and Sherif el-Beit of Kanini is much sought after as an arbitrator in quarrels between the different clans. Paramount Sheikh, Ahmed ibn Qadim. Sub-Tribes.

A nomadic tribe, numbering about 1,000 men, descended from Himyar, who roam the country north of the Nu'a and Wadi Hajar. 1 heir chief Sheikh is Salih ibn Sellm ibn Qutam. 17. Sa'ar. The Sa'ar are probably the most numerous tribe in the Hadhramaut; but though completely independent and lawless, they are too far removed to play a very important part in its politics. They roam the country north of the Nahad and Haurah right up to the edge of the Empty Quarter and are said to number 20,000 men. An old feud exists between them and the Nahad. Their chief is Ibn Jarbu. They claim descent from Kindah. 18. Seihdn. A Himyarite tribe of nomads inhabiting the desolate plateau to the west of the upper reaches of the W adi el-'Aisar. They are bounded on the north by the 'Amudi, on the south by the Akabarah and Beni Hasan, and on the east by the Hamumi. 'Omar ibn Ahmed is their chief Sheikh, but they come also under the suzerainty of the Sultan of Makalla. They are friendly with the Nu'a and the small tribes on their south. With the Hamumi they have a long standing feud which leads to continual lighting. They put about 2,000 men in the field. Abd er-Rahman esh-Shatri has great influence over them.

I lie Vafa' tribe, whose real home is in the Sultanates of Upper and Lower ^ afa' to the north-east of Aden, are represented in the Hadhramaut by the influential and wealthy family of Ka'aiti. Some six generations ago the Seyyids of the Abu Bekr family, at that time the most powerful in the Hadhramaut, were seriously threatened by the Bedouin tribes, and in their extremity invited the assistance of the Yafa' Sultan. The Ka'aiti were sent to the rescue, and having repulsed the enemy, established them selves in the country, where they have been ever since. Their power has steadily grown and was notably increased in 1874 by the expulsion of the Kathiri Sultan from Makalla and Shiheir and the presentation of these two towns to them by the British Government in settlement of a debt which had been repudiated by the Kathiri. They now own Makalla, Shiheir, Shibam, Haurah, and Hajarein, and exercise a suzerainty, which at times is only nominal, over the tribes of 'Amudi, Seiban, and Nahad. 1 heir wealth comes chiefly from the Straits Settlements, whither many Hadhramis migrate, leaving their own sterile country to seek their fortunes abroad. Their connexion with Haiderabad is also very close, the Nizam maintaining a Hadhrami bodyguard, which is always com manded by one of the Ka'aiti family. The present head of the house, styled Sultan of Makalla, is Ghalib ibn A wad el-Ka'aiti, a man of fifty, who is anglophile and maintains close relations with Aden. He keeps a permanent bodyguard of 1,000 men, but frequently has recourse to hiring mercenaries both to maintain himself against his implacable enemies the Kathiri and their allies, and the Hamumi, and also in furtherance of his ambition to add fresh terri tories to his dominions and become the ruling force in the Hadhramaut. He has three brothers, 'O mar , H usein, and M anassar, all of whom he has quarrelled with and expelled from the country.OMAN I. 'Abdhid (sing. 'Abhddi).

Hanbali in religion and Ghafiri in politics ; settled at Sharjah town, Ghallah in Shameiliyah, Khaleibiyah, near Wadi Ham, and on Sheikh Shu'aib Island. 3. 'Abriyin (sing. 'Abri). A tribe of Nizari descent in the Oman Sultanate, belonging to the Ghafiri political faction ; in religion they are mostly Ibadhis, but a small minority are Sunnis. They are found in Dhahirah at 'Araqi ; in Western Hajar at 'Awabi, at 'Aqair in Wadi Shafan, at Zammah and Hat in Wadi Beni 'Auf, at Beit el-Qarn in Wadi Fara', at Tabaqah in Wadi Beni Ghafir, and at 'Amq, Fashah, Maqamma, and Mabu in W T adi Sahtan ; in Oman Proper at Bahlah, Farq, Ghamr, and Hamra ; their number is estimated at 6,500 souls. They cultivate dates and corn, and are generally a well-behaved and peaceable tribe. Ihey are the real masters of 'Awabi, but Bahlah is their tribal capital and Hamra their largest separate village. 4. Beni 'Adi (sing. 'Adwdni). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering about 5,000 souls. Hinawi in politics, settled chiefly in Western Hajar at the villages of Sawalih, Murbah, Qasra, Ghashab, and Wabil in Wadi Fara', but also found on the coast at Qu^at and at Ghuweisah in the sub-vilayet of Saham. Those at Ghashab belong to a section called Beni Bekr. 5. 'Ajam, or Persians (sing. 'Ajmi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering about 10,000 souls, mostly now arabized Shiahs ; settled at Muscat town and in Batinah at Mas- na'ah, Suweiq, Sur esh-Shiyadi, Ghuweisah, Liwa, and Sohar; also in Ru'us el-Jibal at Bakhah. 6. Al 'AH (sing. 'Aliyi). A tribe of Trucial Oman, numbering 6,750 souls, including 140 families of Bedouins ; Ghafiri in politics and professedly Hanbali, though virtually Wahabite in religion. The settled portion are at Umm el-Qaiwein, Sharjah, and Ras el-Kheimah; the Bedouins between Umm el-Qaiwein279 and Jezirat el-Hamra and inland to Fclej Al-'Ali. They claim connexion with the Muteir of Nejd. There is a branch 3 ; 500 strong in the Shibkuh district across the Gulf. 7. Beni 'Ali (sing. 'Alawi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 4,500 souls, Hinawi in politics and Ibadhi in religion, settled in Western Hajar at Wuqbah, Heil beni 'Ali, Yanqul, Murri, and Felej Sedeiriyin, and in Batinah at Saham town. Their tribal capital is Yanqul. They are a leading Hinawi tribe who have generally supported the present ruling family of Muscat. They grow grain and dates. 8. Beni Bn ( Ali (sing. 'Alawi). The principal Ghafiri tribe of the Ja'lan and Sharqlyah districts in the Sultanate of Oman. They are partly nomadic and partly settled : the Bedouin portion inhabit Ja'lan and possess considerable herds of camels and goats, while the settled portion cultivate dates and corn in the Beled Beni Bu 'Ali oasis, and are found also at Sur and at Ras er-Ruweis, Suweih, Khor Beni Bu 'Ali, Jumeilah, and Lashkharah, on the SE. coast of Oman, where they are mostly mariners and fishermen. A few occur at Khabbah in Wadi Khabbah. Some authorities connect the Beni Bu 'Ali with the Al 'Ali of Trucial Oman and the Shibkuh district of Persia. They number in all about 7,000 souls, of whom 1,000 are Bedouins. They became Wahabites at the time of the Nejdi invasions of Oman about a century ago, and as late as 1845 were strict if not fanatical in the observance of Wahabite principles. They have since relaxed somewhat and now smoke tobacco, but they continue to be exact in the forms and times of prayer and are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. They belong to a Wahabite sect known as Azraqah. They are on the average men of middle size with short features and quick deep-set eyes ; gloomy and determined in expression and character ; warlike and independent, with a high reputation for courage and dash. Their favourite weapon was originally a thin, straight, two-edged sword, sharp as a razor and attached by a leather thong to a shield 14 inches in diameter, in addition to which they carried matchlocks ; their armament is now more modern, but they still have few breech loaders (1905). They are the only tribe of the Sultanate who have met a British force on land. On November 9, 1820, they defeated a force of British Indian Sepoys at Beled Beni Bu 'Ali, and on March 2, 1821, suffered severe retribution near the same place. On the latter occasion the tribe lost heavily in killed and wounded, the town and fort were destroyed, and a large number of prisoners were taken, including the principal Sheikh, Mohammed bin 'Ali ; but the date groves were spared—an act of clemency that was much appreciated and is still remembered. The280 prisoners, after being kept for two years at Bombay, were repatriated and received grants of money from the Indian Government to enable them to rebuild their houses and restore irrigation. Since tiiis episode the tribe have uniformly shown themselves well-disposed to the British and ha\ e tieated hospitably more than one British traveller, but they have never fully regained their position in tribal politics. They have a chronic feud with their neighbours the Beni Bu Hasan. I he following are the chief sections, &amp;c., of the tribe : Section. Fahiid Ja'afarah RazTq (Beni) Sinadah Sub-section.

I hey are said to have been a large tribe once, but cholera killed off a great number, I hey have been at feud with the Siyabiyin for many years, but relations are less strained now. The singular form 'Arabi is avoided because it means a hill donkev. 11. Beni 'Auf {sing. 'Aufi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering in all 1,000 souls : Ghafiri in politics ; Ibadhi in religion. They are found in Oman Proper at harq in Wadi Kalbu ; in Western Hajar at Oasmitein and Teikha in Wadi Beni 'Auf, at hara', Misfah, and Nazlyah in Wadi Fara', and at 'Awabi in Wadi Beni Kharus. 12. 'Awamir (sing. { Amiri). A large tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering probably 10,000 souls ; of Xizari descent, but now Hinawi in politics and Ibadhi in religion ; about 6,500 are settled and 3,500 are Bedouins. To take the settled portion first: In Oman Proper they possess the281 villages of 'Aqil, Qal'at el-'Awamir, Felej, Hameidah, Qurlyatein, Qarnt, Khurmah, Shafa', Seiyahi, and Suq el-Qadim, and are found at Nizwa ; they occur also at Muscat town, Beit el-Felej, and Ruwi in the Muscat district; at Ghallah and Sad in Wadi Boshar; at Heil Al 'Umeir, Sib, and Ma'bilah in Batinah ; at Khodh in Wadi Sema'il and at Khubar and Luwiz in Daghmar. Their sections are Aulad Ahmed, Aulad 'Ali ibn Hamad, Aulad 'Ali ibn Khalf, Aulad Amir, Haramilah, Ja'afarah, Aulad el-Ja'id, Khanajirah, Mohammed, Aulad Musa, Rakhbah, Aulad Rashid, Aulad Saba, Aulad Seif, Aulad Salim, Aulad Sand, Sarahin, Sarahin el-Muweilah, and Aulad Shiraz; at Sib a section called Aulad Maheyyi is found. The Bedouin portion range the borders of the Ruba' el-Khali from Trucial Oman in the north, which they occasionally visit in small num bers, to the district of Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia. A term 'Afar frequently used in connexion with the 'Awamir appears to denote a portion of the tribe inhabiting a territory, called 'Afar, between Mahot and Dhofar ; it includes representatives of many sections. The 'Afar are popularly supposed to feed upon carrion : they deny this, but they wear skins and admit that they are not infrequently reduced to devouring them. The 'Awamir are reputed brave and warlike but crafty, treacherous, and predatory ; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet, not excepting members of their own tribe with whom they happen to be unacquainted. They speak a peculiar dialect of Arabic, which varies to such an extent that the westernmost Bedouin sections are hardly understood by their settled brethren in Oman Proper. The 'Awamir are at feud with the Jannabah and the Darii'. 13. 'Awanat (sing. 'Awdni). A tribe of Trucial Oman, now practically extinct; about 50 are found at Khatt and Jezlrat el-Hamra.

A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1,200 souls. Hinawi in politics, and Ibadhi in religion; settled at Barkah and Billah in Batinah. 18. Baharinah (sing. Bahrani). Bahrani does not mean ' native of Bahrein '. It is the name of the race, or class, to which nearly all the Shiahs of the Bahrein Islands, of the Hasa and Qatif oases, and the Qatar promontory belong. The Sunni inhabitant of Bahrein describes himself as Ahl el-Bahrein. As employed along the western coast of the Persian Gulf the term Bahrani is practically a synonym for a Shiah whose mother tongue is Arabic. Altogether the Baharinah number not less than 100,000 souls, of whom only 850 are in Oman, viz. 250 in Sohar town in the Oman Sultanate and 600 in the towns of Abu Dhabi and Dibai in Trucial Oman. They are all Shiahs, unwarlike in character and engaged in peaceful pursuits ; the richer living by trade and the poorer by husbandry, pearl- diving, and various handicrafts. The local tradition is that they are descended from Arab tribes who were converted to Shiism 300 years ago, but some European writers are inclined to regard them as aborigines conquered by the Arabs. 19. Beni Bahri (sing. Bahri). A small tribe of 500 souls, settled in Western Hajar at 'Aliya and 'Awabi in Wadi Beni Kharus and at Hibra in Wadi Ma'awal; in politics Ghafiri, in religion Ibadhi. 20. Baluchi, or Baltish (sing. Balushi). In Baluchistan the word Baloch is strictly used to designate certain respectable middle-class tribes of the country only ; but in the Gulf of Persia and Oman it is used in a wider sense to include all immigrants from Baluchistan and persons whose mother tongue is the Baluchi language. In the Oman Sultanate there are 20,000 Baluchis excluding Jadgals, who in Baluchistan are reckoned as Balochis but here are designated under their proper name from other Balush. In Trucial Oman they number 1,400. In religion they are seldom Shiahs, even abroad, and they settle more readily among Arab than Persian communities. They were originally introduced as mercenaries, and are still largely in military service. The rest incline to sea-faring occupations, and some have amalgamated with the Arabs inland. Their distribution is as below :284 22. Bawdrih (sing. Bdrihi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate numbering 120 souls; Hinawi in politics and Sunni in religion; settled at 'Adeibah in the Muscat district. 23. Baydsirah (sing. Baydsar). A community or tribe of inferior social status, found everywhere in Oman, but specially at Nakhl, Bahlah, and Nizwa, and in the coast towns of Muscat, Matrah, Saham, and Sohar ; they also occur at various places in Wadi Sema'il and at Misinnah and Mali in \\ adi Beni Ghafir. Iheir origin is doubtful ; some authorities state that they are of Hadhramaut origin, but most of them appear to be the children of Oman Arabs by slave mothers. They are not united either in religion or politics. They are peaceable and industrious and some have accumulated wealth, but the Arabs do not entrust them with command, and they are accustomed to remove their sandals before kissing the hand of a Sheikh. They number perhaps 10,000 souls, and are connected among others with the following tribes ; Beni Hasan, 400 houses. Beni Ruwahah, 70 houses. Beni Battash, 30 houses. Habus, 20 houses.

Estimates of their numbers differ very widely : those in Dhahirah may amount to 3,000 souls, of whom about one-third are settled. The Bedouin portion now frequent the neighbourhood of Jebel Hamra. They are a wild and predatory race, and hardly a rising of the eastern tribes occurs in which they are not involved. They reai large numbers of camels, which they graze on the confines of the great desert. The Bedouin Daru' are said to be Ibadhis ; the settled portion are Sunnis. The Daru' are divided into the following sections : Badiwei, Batun, Faradis, Hal Bu Hadi, Janin, Hal Khamis, Yal Khamis, Mahabinah, Maharidah, Majali, Makhadir, Maraziqah, Hal Mohammed, Mutawihah, ' Ayal Nafafi,'Ayal Salim, Shamatah,'Ayal Sultan, Thuweil, and Zuweyyah.286 33.

Seventy years ago they were an independent tribe, Ghafiri in politics and Sunni in religion, regarded as cognate with the Jannabah ; but since that time they have partially lost their tribal individuality, those of Barr el-Hikman having attached themselves to the Beni Bu 'Ali, while others have become Hinawis under the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom they pay annual visits, receiving from him presents. 69.

A few of them are wealthy traders owning merchant vessels, and some who emigrated to Zanzibar have become men of substance and position there. The Hirth do not deal with Sur ; their ports are Matrah and Muscat. They are a warlike tribe, and now armed with rifles of various kinds. Their principal sections (in 1905) were : Section.

They command the road from Sur to Ja'lan above Rafsah, and can close it at pleasure. The whole of the Wadi Beni Khalid is under their control, for the other tribes inhabiting it are always disunited and pay dues, it is said, to the Hishm.296 80. Jahur (sing. Jahuri). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, perhaps a section of the Beni Hina, numbering 700 souls ; Ibadhi in religion and Hinawi in politics ; settled at Mutahaddamat in Wadi 'Adai and at Hifri in Wadi Beni Kharus. 81.

A large tribe of the Oman Sultanate, Yemeni by extraction, but now belonging to the Ghafiri faction, and Sunnis in religion. They number in all about 12,000, of whom 3,000 are nomads. Their tribal capital is Sur, but they possess also Masirah Island, and interspersed with the Hikman and Al Wahibah occupy in a desultory fashion the SE. coast of Oman from Ras Jibsh, where they have a village, to the borders of Dhofar ; some of them visit Murbat in Dhofar ; the cave dwellings on Ras Sajar and the small hamlet of Safqot at the west end of Dhofar are said to be occupied by them. A few reside among the Hikman of Mahot, and detached colonies are found at Bahlah, Khadhra Ibn Daffa', and 'Izz in Oman Proper and at Wadi Manumah in Batinah. It is necessary to distinguish the settled portion, resident chiefly at Sur, from the migratory, pastoral, and fishing sections farther south. The former, known in common with some of the Beni Bu 'Ali as 'Suris', own and navigate a large number of sea-going vessels which run to Bombay, Zanzibar, and the Red Sea ; they are also merchants having297 large depots at Sur, and the Hajriyin of the interior carry on all their foreign trade through them. The pastoral portion are dark-skinned, thin and under-sized, but not ill-looking ; they wear their hair long and confine it round the head with a leather thong. They are disliked by their neighbours, and appear to have little or no religion. In the cool season they come down to the coast with their herds of camels and goats, which are said to be very large, retreating again to caves on the hills on the approach of the SW. monsoon. It has been noticed that those who fish are of a lighter com plexion than the rest, and that their cranial and facial type is peculiar to themselves. As a tribe the Jannabah bear an evil reputation. Those of Sur indulged in slave-dealing and even piracy as long as these courses were open to them, while those of the SE. coast are wreckers and robbers to a man. They have a perpetual feud with the Al Wahibah, the enmity between them being more deadly than between any other tribes in Oman. Their subdivisions and fighting strength are given below : Section, 'Aramah Fawaris Ghayyalln Maja'alah Makhanah Fighting strength. 400 (under-estimated) 600 ,, 450 300 500 Habitat. Sur.

They wear their hair long, tied by a fillet round their heads ; Seyyids, however, and the poorest classes have their heads shaved.

They arrange their hair in a top-knot instead of binding it with a fillet. Their dialect differs from that of other Bedouins of Oman and has not been investigated yet. The Al Kathir are a Hinawi tribe, and claim to have emigrated from Hadhramaut three centuries ago, conquering Dhofar proper and establishing a capital at Dahariz. In religion they are Ibadhis.

It has not now, and never had, as a tribe, any dominant position in the Ghafiri political faction : that the faction was named after it was due not to the strength of the tribe but to the personal energy and talents of its Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Nasir, who commanded the faction in the earliest struggle against the Hinawi.

In the winter some of them pasture their animals on the watershed between the Bereimi oasis and Sohar, and are an important factor in tribal politics at the head of Wadi Hatta. On the north their principal grazing ground is the plain of Jiri, which is shared by their Khawatir section with the Ghafalah tribe. In the direction of Sharjah the tract known as Gharif was once in their possession, but they were displaced by the Beni Ka'ab, who, in their turn, have had to cede it to the Beni Qitab. Roughly speaking there are ordinarily 1,200 Na'im Bedouins in Trucial Oman, 900 in the Sultanate, and 400 in independent Oman. Subdivisions : The Na'im, whether settled or nomadic, belong to one of two main divisions—the Al Bu Khareiban, who are said to be descendants of Khazraj, and the Al Bu Shamis, who are said to be descendants of 'Aus. The following are some of the better known sections of these two main divisions. Al Bu Khareiban suh-trihe : 'Aryan at Hafit, 140 souls. Al Bu Adhnein or Dhanein at 'Ajman and elsewhere, 700 souls. Hamlrat at 'Ajman and elsewhere, 180 souls. Khawatir at Hafit and the Jiri plain, 500 souls. Qaratisah at Bireimi and Su'arah. Al Bu Kelbi of 'Ajman town (perhaps a section). The Al Bu Shamis suh-trihe: 'Ayal f Aziz at Dhank town, 700 souls; believed not to be really Na'Im (see above, p. 281). Darawishah at Heirah, Hamriyah, Sharjah town, and Ras el- Kheimah town, 1,500 souls. ('Ayal) Hiyah or Ahiya in Dhank town, 150 souls. Kilabinah at Hafit and Sanqar. Shawamis at Bizeili, Saneinah, and Dhank, 1,400 souls. Waha'ishah at Dhank town, 250 souls. The Na'im are Ghafiri in politics, and, with few exceptions, Hanbali in religion. 140. Naqhiyin (sing. Naqhi). A tribe of Trucial Oman, numbering 1,800 souls ; Hanbali in religion and Ghafiri in politics ; settled in Sharjah principality on the east side of the Oman promontory at Khor Fakkan, Ghallah, Lulayyah, Zubarah, Dibah, Fahlein, Khatt, and Diftah. They are generally hostile to their neighbours the Sharqiyin. They are all engaged in agriculture.309 141. Al Bin Ndsir (sing. Ndsiri). A tribe of Trucial Oman, numbering 120 souls; Sunni in religion; all settled in Abu Dhabi town. They live by pearl-diving and fishing and petty trade apparently. 142. Nawdfil (sing. Naufili). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 300 souls. Ibadhi in religion, Hinawi in politics; settled in Batinah at Bu 'Abali, Sha'ibah, Majiz en-Nawafil, and Masna'ah. They are dependent on the Hirth and a few are Bedouins. 143. Niddbiym (sing. Niddbi). A settled tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 3»5 00 souls; Ghafiri in politics, in religion Ibadhi. Their villages are Lizugh, Mizra' Bu Ba'arah, Fankh, Da'sar, Sinsilah in Wadi el-'Aqq; Mizra' and Mizra* el-Heitani in Wadi Seijani; Mahbub, Hassas, and Sarur in Wadi Sema'il; Jar da in Eastern Hajar. Though not a large tribe their position in Wadi el-'Aqq and Wadi Seijani commands the principal route from Sharqiyah to Matrah and Muscat towns, and their services have frequently been retained by the Sultans of Oman to bar the progress of insurgents from Sharqiyah to the capital. 144. Nidheiriyln (sing. Nidheiri). A small tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 300 souls, settled at Dawwah in Wadi Beni Khalid in Eastern Hajar ; Ghafiri in politics, in religion Ibadhi. 145. Beit el-Qalam. A few at Murbat in Dhofar. Nothing known about them. 146. Qara. A wild tribe in the Samhan hills in Dhofar, ranging from Sadah on the east to Rakhyut on the west, and inland as far as the country is habitable, which is not a great distance. They number about 5,000 souls, all nomadic except a few hundred settled at Kharif5t (30 houses), Murbat (10 houses), Rakhyut (65 houses), Sadah (20 houses), and Taqa (20 houses). They call themselves Hakli, speak a language which has been described as a dialect of Mahri, and are commonly stated to be a branch of the Mahrah tribe. They differ greatly in appearance and character from the typical Arab, who regards them as heathens. They are classed as Sunnis of the Ghafiri faction, but it is doubtful whether they are Arabs at all. They keep camels, cattle, sheep, and goats, and subsist chiefly by collecting frankincense and other gums. They also do a little cultivation and a little business in hides and ghi. In winter they live in caverns which, if large enough, they share with their animals.✓ 310 One cavern at Dirbat is 150' x 5c/ x 30'. A few have guns, the rest use iion swords, daggers, and even pointed throwing sticks. They carry a shield which serves also as a hat or water bucket or stool as desired. They quarrel and fight amongst themselves, and are a restless irresponsible lot, but are not a resolute or really dangerous tribe. They may annoy their neighbours by damaging their crops at night, but they never attack settled villages. 1 heir principal divisions are : Beit 'Ak'ak, at Rakhyut, 150 fighting men. Bara/amah, in Samhan hills, behind Salalah, 160 fighting men. Beit Hardan, in the hills near Rakhyut, 70 fighting men. Beit Tsa, at Rakhyut, 80 fighting men. Beit Jabub, in the hills, 160 fighting men. Beit Qatan, in the hills, 150 fighting men. Beit Ka'bdb, in the hills. Beit Kishob, in the hills, 170 fighting men. Kathob or Ma'ashani at Taqa, and in the hills about Wadi Dirbat, 700 fighting men. Beit Sa id, in the hills behind Hasiki, 300 fighting men. Shamasah at Rakhyut, 90 fighting men. Beit Tabok, in the hills, 170 fighting men. Beni (or Ahl) 'Umr, at Murbat and in the hills near by, 1 ,200 fighting men. 1 his section is friendly to the Sultan of Oman, and has a subsection, Beit Makhayyir. 147. Al Bu Qarein (sing. Qareini). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 400 souls ; Ibadhi in religion, Hinawi in politics ; settled at Dhiyan and Hajeirah in Batinah. Some at Hajeirah are Bedouins. 148. Qateit (sing. Qateiti). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, very few in number ; Sunni in religion, Hinawi in politics. Settled in Khaburah town. 149. Qawd'id (sing. Qa'idi). A Bedouin tribe of Trucial Oman, numbering 250 souls. They range round about Shokah in Wadi Ham ; some of them cultivate a little, and are semi-settled at Shokali. They are believed by some to be an off-shoot of the Mazari', but this is doubtful. 150. Qawasim or Jawdsim (sing. Qdsimi or Jdsimi). This is the family or small tribe to which the ruling sheikh of Sharjah belongs; it claims descent from the prophet Mohammed. Outside 1 rucial Oman the subjects of Sharjah are sometimes spoken of as Jawasim,311 and a tribe which has submitted to the sheikh is said to have become ' Jasimi' ; to this fact is probably due the indiscriminate application in old British records of the term ' Joasmee ' to all the piratical inhabitants of what is now Trucial Oman. The Trucial flag of 1820 unfortunately came to be known, and is still known, as the Jasimi flag, and the Beni Yas of Abu Dhabi have consequently always shown a disinclination to fly it. The genuine Qawasim in Trucial Oman in 1905 only numbered 18 adult males. Other Qawasim to the number of 650 occur at Duvvan in the Lingeh district of the Persian coast. A tribe of Qawasim, supposed to be identical with the genuine Qawasim by some, while others hold it to be a section of the Nidabiyln, is settled in the Oman Sultanate at Miltiqa in Wadi Sema'il, Nafa'ah in Wadi Mansah, Felej el-Hijari in Wadi Riseil, Mizra' el-'Alawi in Wadi Maih, and at Bandar Jissah on the Muscat coast. This tribe numbers 1,100 souls. 151. Beni Qitah (sing. Qithi). A tribe of Oman, having a considerable range over the promontory and in Dhahirah. They number about 4,800, of whom 2,500 are settled in the sultanate in the cluster of villages known as Aflaj Beni Qitab, in Dhahirah, and 200 at Dheid, in the Sharjah principality. The remaining 2,100 are Bedouins, whose territory is bounded by the northern end of the Dheid plain, the towns of Sharjah and Dibai, the Bireimi Oasis, and the western slopes of the promontory. The Bedouins muster 600 fighting-men in their seven sections, as follows:—Farariyah, 100; Hawafir, 80 ; Khasawinah, 120 ; Ma'aliyah, 40 ; Masa'id. 180 ; Midhaqarah, 30 ; Shibanat, 50. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has recently admitted the Beni Qitab to be clients of the Sheikh of Umm el-Qaiwein. In politics they are Ghafiri, and in religion Sunni. 152. Radeindt (sing. Radeini). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 250 souls; Sunni in religion, Hinawi in politics ; settled at 'Abbasah in Batinah. 153. Rahbiyin (sing. Rahbi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 5,000 souls; Ghafiri in politics, Ibadhi in religion ; settled in the upper part of Wadi Tayin and in Wadi Mansah and its tributaries. Wasit, between Wadis Tayin and Mansah, is the seat of the principal Sheikh. The Suwabiq at Beyyadh is one of their sections, and the Aulad or Beni Mahriz at Ba'ad and Mizbur is perhaps another.312 154- Ramah (sing. Ramhi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1 ,500 souls. Ghafiri in politics, Ibadhi in religion ; settled in Western Hajar, at 'Ain er-Ramah, and not found anywhere else. They are goldsmiths. 155. Beni Raqdd (sing. Raqddi). A small tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 250 souls ; originally Yemeni, now Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion ; settled at Misfah, Lansab, and Ghallah in the Muscat district and at Badi'ah in Wadi Tayin in Eastern Hajar. 156. Al Bu Rasheid (sing. Rasheidi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 600 souls; Ibadhi in religion, Hinawi in politics ; settled at 'Abbasah and Khadhra in Batinah. They are partly Bedouin and dependent on the Hirth. 157. Beni Rdshid or Rawdshid. A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 3,500 souls ; Ibadhi in religion, Hinawi in politics ; settled in Batinah at Khishdah in Sohar ; in Dhahirah at 'Araqi and Dariz in Wadi el-Kebir ; in Oman Proper at Adam, Bahlah, Khadhra Bin Daffa/ in Sharqiyah, and Nizwa at Sana'u. 158. Beni Rdsib (sing. Rdsibi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1 ,500 souls ; Ghafiri in politics and bigoted W'ahabite in religion ; settled at Wafi in Ja'lan and at feud with the Beni Bu Hasan, Their sections are Aulad Paris, Maraziqah, and Aulad Rabi'. 159. Beni Riydm (sing. Riydmi). A somewhat peculiar tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 11 ,000 souls ; Ghafiri in politics, Ibadhi in religion ; settled at Izki (450 houses), Kamah (20 houses), Manah (140 houses), Birkat el-M5z (250 houses), Karsha (20 houses), Muti (300 houses), Nizwa (500 houses), Tanuf (40 houses), and Zikeit (15 houses), all in Oman Proper ; also at Shareijah (100 houses), and Seiq (60 houses) in Jebel Akhdhar ; also at Misfah (100 houses) in Wadi Beni Kharus, and at Hijar (50 houses) and Qorah (40 houses) in Wadi Mistal. They are said to be of Yemeni descent and among the earliest Arab settlers in Oman. They are well to do and peaceable, but those of the hills are disliked as being irascible, slothful, immoral, and inhospitable ; the prejudice against them may be partly due to their disregard of Mohammedan principles in drinking a wine made by themselves from home-grown grapes. They are described as haggard and prematurely old, and lacking the usual vivacity and strength of mountaineers. The women go unveiled, and are sometimes of a clear ruddy complexion. Their sections are Jawamid at Seiq and Shareiqiyin at Misfah.313 160. Riydyisah (sing. Risi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1,000 souls ; Sunni in religion, Hinawi in politics ; settled at Haseifm Sur er-Riyayisah in Batinah, at Tawi in Western Hajar, and in Shinas town. 161. Beni Ruwdhah (sing. Ruwdhi). An important tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 18,500 souls ; Ibadhi in religion and Hinawi in politics, though said to be of Nizari descent. Their principal seat is the upper part of Wadi Sema'il, called Wadi Beni Ruwahah, which they monopolize, having 900 houses there ; but they also inhabit the lower villages of 'Adhdah (50 houses), Rissah (20), Rufei'ah (80), Qarwashlyah (50), Naghzah (50), Suharah (100), Hijrat Aulad Sa'ad (50), Jammar (75), Hijrat el-Bakriyin (100), Ibra- himiyah (40), Beit Weled el-Khalili (100), Subarah (50), Daqdaqain (20), and Tasawir (25). In Wadi Boshar they are found at Fuleij esh-Sham (15), in Wadi Dima at Hajir (100), and in Oman Proper at Izki, Khadhra Bin Daffa' (60), Nizwa (4), and Saddi (10). In Wadi Mistal they occur at Ghubrah Beni Ruwahah (40) and Heil (40). The greater part of Wadi 'Andam belongs to them and the whole of Wadi Mahram. They are a troublesome tribe ; they were against the Sultan of Oman from 1871 to 1888 consistently, and are supposed to be still very hostile ; but they can be bought, as they were in 1905, when the Sultan made use of them. Half a mile below the village of Wabal, in W adi Beni Ruwahah, is a wall with towers and a gate through which the highway leads. This is called Darwazah (door), and its object is to close the route up the valley. It is permanently held by a garrison of the Beni Ruwahah. The tribe apparently owns few camels but many cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats, and thousands of date-palms. They also go in for trade, market-gardening, cultivation, and transport. The principal subdivisions of the Beni Ruwahah are : A.316 169. Ydl c Ahd es-Saldm (sing. Salami).

A tribe of Trucial Oman, numbering 7,000 souls, residing entirely within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Sharjah, found chiefly in the Shameiliyah tract and in Wadi Ham, but also in smaller numbers in the Jiri plain and in the Ras el-Kheimah district. Their principal settlements are at Bidyah (300 houses), Fujeirah (150), Gharfah (100), Marbah (100), Oareyyah (100), Qidfa' (100), and Ghallah (70). About half of those residing in the Shameiliyah tract have succeeded ( I 9 0 5) ) nnder the leadership of the Sheikh of Fujeirah, in casting off the yoke of Sharjah. Their independence has not, however, been recognized by the British Government. The occupations of the Sharqiym are various. They cultivate, fish, dive for pearls, trade with Muscat and Sib, grow dates and keep live-stock according to the facilities of the place where they reside. Their sections are Hafeitat, Yamamahah, Hamudiyin. Some claim the Jalajilah, Maharizah, and Zahum as sections of the Sharqiyin, but this is not certain. 187. Shawafi' (sing. Shdfa'i). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 400 souls ; Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion ; settled at 'Aweinat in Sohar in Batinah. 188. Shaw amis (sing. Shdmisi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 100 souls ; Hinawi in politics; settled at Habbas in Wadi Sema'il. There is a Shawamis section of the Na'im and also of the Beni Keleib. 189. Shihuh (sing. Shihhi). A peculiar tribe who inhabit the Oman promontory from Bei'ah northwards on the eastern coast, and from Khor Khuweir northwards on the western coast. The whole of the Ru'us el-Jibal district is in their occupation, except a few villages belonging to the Dhahuriyin. They also occupy Sha'am, Ghalilah, and Khor Khuweir in the Sharjah princi pality and the village of Heil in Sir, and are found, too, at Saham town in Batinah. Their number is roughly estimated at 21,500 souls, of whom 14,500 are on the coast and 7,000 in the interior. Those of the interior are described as Bedouin, but some of them have houses built of loose stone. The Shihuh are almost entirely included in the dominions of the Sultan of Oman. Only about 2,000 of those on the coast and a few of those in the interior are resident in Trucial Oman. There is little intercourse between the coastal Shihuh and their brethren of the interior, many of whom never come down to the coast. The former are chiefly engaged in diving and wading for pearls and in fishing, though they keep goats and grow dates where they can : their food is chiefly fish which they catch, rice which they import, and dates319 which they grow and import. The latter are engaged in tending large flocks of goats and in agriculture. With irrigation from natural reser voirs in the hills they grow almost all the grain they want for home consumption. They live on the produce of their cultivation and their goats, and have nothing to do with the sea. In religion the Shihuh, both settled and nomad, are mostly Shafeis, but from and including Sha'am and Bei'ah southwards on either side of the promontory they are now Hanbalis. As a tribe they are still imperfect Moslems ; those in the hills have no mosques and are extremely superstitious, still offering sacrifices to the mountain Jinns. From the time of the Wahabite movement, however, they have given up worshipping at Mazars or tombs of holy men. There are two languages spoken amongst them. The more general is the Shihhi dialect of Arabic ; the other is an Iranian dialect chiefly spoken at Kumzar, and on Larak Island by the Kumazirah subdivision of the Beni Shateir and their Dhahuriyln relations. From this fact it is inferred that the Shihuh are a composite tribe, originally Arab, but now containing some Persian elements. There are two main divisions of the tribe : 1. Beni Hadlyah. 2. Beni Shateir. The coastal Shihuh regard only these two main divisions and classify themselves in detail by villages and not by sub-sections. In the interior the classification is by sub-sections. The following is the classification by sections among the nomad Shihuh of the interior : Section. Beni Mohammed 'Abeid Beni 'Ali. Two clans of equal strength: (i) Ahl 'Aqabah; (2) Beni Yideid Beni Ibrahim Khanazirah Beni Ham Mazyud 1. Beni Hadiyah. Families.

Beni Sindn (sing. Sindni). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1,500 souls ; Ghafiri in politics and Sunni in religion ; settled at Quryat and Sur (Saneisalah) in the Eastern Hajar. 195. Siydhiyln (sing. Siydhi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 5,500 souls ; Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion; somewhat widely distributed, found chiefly in the Hajar and Muscat districts. Their tribal capital is Nafa'ah (300 houses) in Wadi Mansah; other principal settlements are Sib edh- Dhafar, Ghail ed-Dakk, Ghubrah, Dan, Bidbid, Mizra', Qurta', Milay- yinah, and 'Amqat, all in Wadi Sema'il; Rissah and Seijani in Wadi Seijani ; Felej Shirah and Misfah in W T adi Fara' ; Khabbah in Wadi Khabbah; Ghubrat et-Tam in Wadi Tayln ; Sa'al, Ghallah, and both Misfahs in W'adi Boshar. Mareirat, Jafnein, and Riseil in Wadi Riseil; Sib and Barkah ; in Batinah and at Matrah. Those at Rissah belong to a section called Mubasili. Some of the Siyabiyin are rich, but the tribe generally are not held in much repute.

Subhi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 500 souls ; Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion ; settled at Abyadh in Wadi Beni Kharus in Western Hajar, and also in Oman Proper (not stated where).321 197- Sudan (sing. Suweidi). A tribe of Trucial Oman, El-Qatar, and Bahrein ; they are closely connected with the Kunud, and their descent from Aswad el-Kindi— supposed to have been an immigrant from Yemen in the time of Mohammed—is generally admitted. They number in all about 5,500 souls, of whom nearly 5,000 reside in the ports of Trucial Oman. They have 375 houses at Abu Dhabi town, 30 at Batin, 250 at Dibai town, 300 at Sharjah town, 20 on Bu Musa Island in the Sheikhdom of Sharjah, 12 at 'Ajman, 80 at Dohah in Qatar, 10 at Hadd in Bahrein, and 49 on Sirri Island. There is little to differentiate the Sudan of Trucial Oman from the other tribes among whom they dwell ; but those of Qatar are distinguished from most of their Sunni neighbours by being Hanabilah and not Muwalik. Their two principal divisions are the Al Ramdha and the Al Salmin. They now live by dealing in and diving for pearls and other seafaring occupations. 198. Suwdlih (sing. Salhi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 600 souls; Sunni in religion and Hinawi in politics; settled at Suweiq in Batinah. 199. Suwdwifah (sing. Suwdfi), A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1,500 souls; Hinawi in politics, except for those at Khabbah, who are Ghafiri. They are settled in Eastern Hajar at Khabbah and Quryat; in Sharqiyah at Sana'u; in Dhahirah at Saleif in Wadi el-'Ain. 200. Teiwdnlyah (sing. Teiwdni). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 300 souls; Ibadhi in religion and Hinawi in politics. Settled at Muscat town and in Oman Proper at Nizwa. 201. Tatimmaha (sing. Tamtami). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 300 souls ; Ibadhi in religion and Hinawi in politics. Settled at Misfah and 'Awabi in Wadi Boshar. 202. Taneij (sing. Taneiji). A tribe of Trucial Oman, numbering 4,000 souls, Hanbali in religion and Ghafiri in politics ; 2,500 are settled at Rams (400 houses), Dheid (70), and Hamriyah (30), and 1,500 are Bedouins ranging round Dheid. Rams belongs exclusively to the Taneij. Their houses are mostly of mud and stone. The chief occupations of the settled portion of the tribe are fishing and pearl-diving. They have some date plantations two miles inland at Dhayah. a s s323 207. Al Wahlhah (sing. Waheihi). A very important tribe of the Sharqiyah and Ja'lan districts in the Oman Sultanate, almost entirely Bedouin, and enjoying at present (1905) a high position in the tribal system. They number about 13,000 souls. Ibadhi in religion and Hinawi in politics. The sedentary members occupy the villages of Sadeirah and Aflaj and part of the town of Mudheibi in the Baldan el-Habus division of Sharqiyah ; they are found also on the SE. coast as far north as Ras Sheiblah (20 houses), and as far south as Ras Sarab ; settlements of them exist at Majiz el-Wahibah (100) and Laghshibah (20) in Batinah, at 'Adeibah (15) and Ghubrah (30) in Muscat ; and at Ghallah (10) in Wadi Boshar. The Al Wahibah are warlike, but though always ready to fight for plunder they are not unpleasant in ordinary dealings. They own the fastest camels in Oman and practically no date-groves or villages. This combination makes them most elusive enemies. They have a bitter feud with the Jannabah and sometimes among the Hikman of Mahot Parties of them regularly visit the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and receive presents from him. The majority of the nomads are purely pastoral but a few on the SE. coast are expert fishermen. They are divided into many sections under six large, but apparently nameless groups : Groups of sections and fighting strength (1905).

Washahdt (sing. Washdhi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 850 souls; in religion, mostly Ibadhi, with some Shafei; in politics mostly Hinawi, with some Ghafiris. Settled at Tameit, Mushabbah, and 'Ajib in Wadi Hatta and at Aswad in Wadi el-Qor. 210. Ya'dqib (sing. Ya'qubi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 3,500 souls; of Yemeni origin, but now Ghafiri in politics and Sunni in religion. Settled at 'Ibri, in Dhahirah. 211. Ya'dribah (sing. Ya'rabi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 800 souls; Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion. Settled at Nakhl, Tuweyyah, Tikhah, and Hazam. They were once important, and supplied the rulers of Oman from a. d. 1625 to 1744. They have no influence now. 212. Yahdmidah (sing. Yahmadi). A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 300 souls ; Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion. Settled in Sohar town and Nakhl. 213. Beni Yds. One of the most compact and powerful tribes of Trucial Oman ; their range is practically co-extensive with the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the basis of whose power they are. Nomad. The Beni Yas nomads, numbering about 2,000 souls, are all in the Abu Dhabi principality. Their favourite pastures are in Beinunah, a tract of the Dhafrah district. Settled. The non-nomads number in all about 12,000 ; of whom about 8,000 are settled in the Abu Dhabi principality, about 2,000 in Dibai territory, and the rest outside Oman, viz.: 1,200 in Hanjam Island, 600 in Bahrein, 200 on Tarut Island, and over 100 in Qatar. In Abu Dhabi town they number 2,800 souls, and in Dibai they occupy 440 houses. Here, on the coast, they are engaged in pearl-fishing and navigation. Inland, in Dhafrah, they number 5,100 souls and hold all the per manent settlements. [The only other tribe to be seen in Dhafrah is the Mansuri (Manasir), and they only come to summer in the Liwah sub division.] Here the Beni Yas are semi-civilized, living in huts of date- sticks and leaves, owning date plantations individually (not collectively as do the Manasir) and trading and corresponding with Abu Dhabi and even Dibai. Their main industry is date-growing, but some of them take a share in pearl-fishing and own a number of boats which are kept at Bandar Radeim, Khor Mugheirah, and Bandar Mirfah. The pearl- fishers pay dues and the date-growers pay 2,500 dollars a year as agri cultural taxes to the Abu Dhabi Sheikh. Although, at times, sectionsf 16 325 of the tribe in the principality have evinced a disposition to hive off (as did the A1 Bu Falasah section who now live in Dibai), the tribe as a whole is well-affected and faithful to the Sheikh, and he is himself one of their number (A1 Bu Falah section). The Beni Yas are of the Hinawi political faction and differ from most of their neighbours in being, wherever they occur, Maliki Sunms and not Hinawi. They had in 1905 no special relations of friendship or enmity with adjoining tribes ; at that time the following were their tribal sections ; Sections. A1 Falah A1 Bu Falah (the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi belongs to this section). A1 Bu Falasah Subsections. A1 Sa'dun. (Mijardah. Rawashid. lYideiwat or Lideiwat. A1 Bu Hamir. Hawamil. Maharibah. Mazari'.

They marry among themselves and are farriers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, armourers, carpenters, pedlars. Their women dance for payment but are not immoral. The levirate law obtains among them. They are despised but not molested by the Arabs, who value them for their services. 219. Beni Zld (sing. Zldi).

Full-blooded negroes dwell in some numbers in Jauf el-'Amr, and at Huweyyat beyond the western borders of Jebel Shammar. At Hayat, also beyond the border, are about 100 houses of negroes and T t 2 /INDIA OFFICE RECORDS MICROFILM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000884.0x000164_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/C131</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000884.0x000164</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/C131</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Personalities, Arabia'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1917/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-31T00:53:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (185 folios)</extent><extent>There is a list of contents on folio 3v.
