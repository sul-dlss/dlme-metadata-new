The title page and four page introduction are followed by prints lightly tipped onto the album pages, each preceded by a sheet of letterpress caption.The volume provides a comprehensive record of the events and personalities involved in the Durbar, summed up in the introduction as follows:'The Delhi Durbar Photo Biographic Album is designed as a pictorial rather than a historical record of the Coronation Durbar. The photographs which it is composed of have been chosen from an immense collection of portraits and views far beyond the compass of any single volume. The pictures here given represent the important visitors, Princes, delegates, functions, etc., and constitute the most perfect and complete reproduction in photography of an Imperial celebration which will live in the minds of men as the greatest of its kind in the history of the modern world.'The album presents a particularly fine series of portraits of Indian princes who attended the Durbar.Elements:1 His Majesty the King, Emperor of India.

Subsequently, each folio bearing a photograph is preceded by a letterpress folio bearing the caption of the photograph. Each letterpressed folio features decorative borders.The images are numbered, 1–133, alongside the image in pencil. Folios are numbered in the upper right corner in pencil, 1–207.Temporal Context:Most photographs were likely taken during the Delhi Durbar of 1903 to celebrate the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Many of the portraits use the same studio backdrop of a cusped archway and a number of other props indicate that the portraits were taken in the same studio. A possible exception is print Photo 430/78/75, which may have been taken by the Rangoon photographer Philip Klier. Most of the other views also relate to specific events during the course of the durbar although at least one general view (Photo 430/78/100) dates from the early 1860s.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bourne and Shepherd, photographers</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">photographer</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston George Nathaniel Curzon</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">owner; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Delhi</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Durbars</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023494119.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
