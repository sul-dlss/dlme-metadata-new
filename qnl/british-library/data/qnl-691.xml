Names; but my Ambition or Prefumption has a jufter Plea in claiming your Grace's Pa tronage, fince you have been pleafed to honour me with fe- veral Inftances of your Favour; therefore,! humbly prefume to lay thefe curfory Obfervations that I made in my Travels to the Eaft Indies, at your Grace's Feet; and if they find Accep tance, I fhall not much mind theCehtureof Criticks, or Sa- tyrifts: For I am perfwaded, that the very Name of fo il- luftrious a Patron will be fuf- ficient to protect and defend me. If I had thought, while I was in India, of making my Ob fervations or Remarks publick, and, to have had the Honour ofmm The Dedication. v of prefenting them to fo noble a Patron, I had certainly been more careful and curious in my Colledions, and of keep ing Memorandums to have made this Work more com plete : But it muft now ap pear, to fome Difadvantage, (for want of thofe Ornaments) in its native fimple Drefs, as it came polling through a weak ana, treacherous .Memory with little Elegancy. I have feen the elaborate Works of feveral ingenious Pens, who had travelled thro' many Countries, in Maps, that I have travelled to by Sea and Land &gt; they may have many Advantages to recommend their Works that I want; yet, iew (if any) ever had the ii- a 3 vingvi The Dedication. ving Acquaintances that I have had, to inform or inftrud them in many Particulars relating to the ancient, or prefent State of their Countries, whofe verna cular Languages can beft illu^ ftrate their Hiftories, fome of which I underftood. All that have travelled in thofe Countries before me, have omitted fome Things worthy of Obfervation, and have remarked fome Things impertinent enough; and, as I take the Liberty to cenfure them, I exped the fame Treat- ment from thofe that may tra vel after me, and for the ve ry fame Fault. Thofe Five, or Six and thir ty Years that I fpent in the Eaji Indies, ftrolling from Place toThe Dedic vii to Place, gave me Opportuni ties to know fome topographi cal, hiftorical, and theogonal Parts of this Work, from the Natives, of their refpedive Countries, who may be pre- fumed to be better acquain ted with their own Traditions and Cuftoms, than Strangers, who are often at a Lofs for want of Language. 1 will not apologize ( as ma ny do ) for my Weaknefs or Unfitnefs for this Undertak- ing, for I affure your Grace, if I had not thought my felf pretty well qualified for it, I had never fet about it. And, as my Travels have been moll along the Sea-coafts, I have defcribed the Harbours, Rivers, and Dangers on them, * 4 prettyyiii 77) c T^cdiecitioii, pretty punitually.

I will not trouble your Grace with Encomiums, either on your felf, or your illuftrious Anceftors, for your Names and Characters are fo well known all ovet Europe, and in fome Parts farther off, by di- ftinguifhing Marks, that it would be but Prefumption in me to offer to add any Thing to them j but pleafe to accept of my bell Wifhes for .the Welfare of your Grace, and your illuftrious Family andThe Dedicafx Kindred 5 and that the Al mighty may protect and di- red: you in a virtuous Life, and make you a peculiar Fa vourite in the Court of Hea ven, fhall always be the fincere Prayer of 3 Mj LORD, Tour Grace i and mofi hum Servant, Alex.

The Sheeps Guts ferve both Sexes for Bracelets, and the Tallow, mixt with Soot, is their ^Pomatum^ with which they bedaub their woolly Heads, Fa^ ces.and the reft of their Bodies. And when they come on board of our Shipping to traf- fick their Fowls, Roots and Herbs^ with our Needles, Scizers, Knives, &amp;c. Toys, they go firft to the Cook-room, and look out for fome Greafe to anoint their nafty Carcafes, and fcrape the Bottoms of the Kettles for Soot, to beautify their Skins. N otwithstanding that they are fa brutal and indocile, they know the Value of Liberty, and will by no Means be Slaves, at leaft to any Europe Nations; and, in their Difpofitions, are not cruel, tho' revengeful* They are not fuperftirious, for what Adora tion they pay, is to the Sun, and that buc feldom. The Country is mountainous. The t A i Hiiii4. A new Account Hills are ftored with Deer and Sheep, black Cattle, Lions, Tigers, and other voracious Animals. The Vallies produce good Wheat and Legumen, Grapes in Abundance, and many other excellent Fruits, Oftriches, and good Fowl both wild and tame : And the Sea and Rivers good Store of Hfhes, befides the Manatee, or Sea-cow. The Englijh defpairing of fettling a Co lony there, left it, and fettled at St. Helena, a very high mountainous liland, lying be tween the Coaft of Guinea and America, a- bout 6io Leagues North-weft half Weft from the Cape of Good Hope ; and the 'Dutch Eaji-indta Company fettled a Colony at Cape bona Efperanza, by the Afflftance of fome French Refugees, who have penetrated near 300 Englijh Miles into the Land, and manure the Ground to very good Purpofe, it yielding them Wines and W heat in Abun dance. The Dutch Company has a ftrong Fort, and a Town on the South Side of a Bay, that ferves for a good Road for Ship ping in all Winds, except thofe that blow between the North and Weft. The Englijh call'd generally there, in their Way to and from India, in former Times, for Refrefli- ments ; but of late the • white Hottentots will not permit the poor Britons to carry on board their Ships any Cattle, Sheep or Fowte with Life in them, for the Support or Relief of their dear Friends and Allies, notwithftanding the confcienti'ous Prices we would willingly beftovv for their Edibles,of the Eaft Indies. 5 The black Hottentots would ihew the En- ghjh much more Humanity, if the white did not reilrain them ; and fo I leave them, and proceed to the Eallward. F rom Cape Bona Efperanza to Natal, is a dangerous Sea-coaft, and little frequented, whether by the Unfociablenefs of the Hotten tots the Inhabitants, or that the Country produces nothing worth the Merchants ad venturing thither for, I know not; but to Natal I have known fome Englijh VefTels go from India, for Elephants Teeth, and did make pretty good Voyages; bat they were Two Years and an Half in performing a Voy age. The Country is fertil, but unwholfom. The Woods are thick fet with feveral Sorts of Trees, and ilored with Elephants, Lions, Leopards, Bears, Wolves, Deer and Foxes ; the Rivers with Fifh, Manatees and Croco diles. Here lived, in Anno 1718. a penitent Pirate, who fequeltred himfelf from his abo minable Community, and retired out of Harm's Way. T here is no Commerce on the Coaft be tween Natal and Delagoa, I believe, for the fame Reafon that I gave for the Unfrequent- ednefs of the Coalt between the Cape of Good-loofe and Natal ; and I believe, the firft communicative Commerce, either to Natal or Uelappa, with the Englijh, came by Acci dent; for about the Year 1683. aa Englijh Ship, called the Johanna, was loft fomewhere about c Delagoa. The Natives, who were re puted great Barbarians, lliew'd the fliip- A 3 'wrack'4(5 A new Account wrackM Men much more Civility and Huma nity than fome Nations that I know, who pretend much Religion and Politenels, for they accommodated their Guefts with whate ver they wanted of the Produtl of their Country, at very eafy Rates, and affifted what they could, to fave Part of the damaged Car go, receiving very moderate Rewar ds for their Labour and Pains. Their Language was by Signs; and for a few Glafs-beads, Knives, Scizers, Needles, Thread and fmall Looking- glafles, which they are very fond of, they hi red themfelves to carry many portable I hings (that were faved from the Shipwrack) to a neighbouring Country, and procured others, who alfo ferved them for Guides towards the Cape of Good-hope^ and provided Eatables for their Matters, all the while they were under their Conduft ; and having carried them a- bout ^oo Miles on their \V ay, by Land, they provided new Guides and Porters for them, for fome of the aforefaid Trifles, who con duced them, and provided for them, as the others had done, for 7 or 800 Miles farther, which they travelled in 40 Days, and fo deli vered their Charge to others, who condu ced and provided for them, till they arrived at the Cape ; and fome of the Englijh falling lick on the Way, they carried the Sick in Hammocks, till they either recovered or died, and out of 80 Men there were but 3 o r 4 died; but how long they journeyed before they arrived at the Cape, I have forgotten. This Account I had from one of the Travel-of the Eaft Indies. y lers. He told me, that the natural Fertility of thofe Countries he travelled thro', made the Inhabitants lazy, indolent, indocile and fimple. Their Rivers are abundantly ftored with good Fifli and Water-fowl, befides Manatees, or Sea-cows and Crocodiles ; their Woods with large Trees, wild Cattle and Deer, E- lephants, Rhinocerofes, Lions, Tigers, Wolves and Foxes for Game; alfo many Sorts of winged Fowl and Birds, befides O- flriches. They have fome Notions of a Deity, whom they worlhip with Dancing and Feaft- ing, for they are generally very much incli ned to Mirth, an Inftance whereof. I'll ven ture to relate, on the Account I had from a Mafter of a Ship, who went thither to trade in Anno 1718. viz. When^they had got their Ship fecured in a River, the Natives aiTem- bled in good Numbers to traffick, near the Place where the Ship lay: An arch Indian Youth, who was a very good Drummer, car ried his Drum afliore, and in a Thicket pret ty near the Alfembly, beat his Drum very briskly, on which the Young of both Sexes, fell a skipping, and a little after the Adult and Old followed their Example, fo that none' flood idle Spedators; but the Old beginning; to tire, fome went to the Drummer, and prelffited him with Eggs, Fowl and Fruits, and intreated him to leave off, which allbon as he did, they all fat down again on the Ground, well heated. I faw feveral Rhinocerofes Horns brought thence to Bombay, much longer than ever 1 A 4 fawS j4 ne-w Account faw in India or China, and one was three Horns growing from one Root; the longeft vyas about 18 Inches, the fecond about ix. and the third about 8. but fmaller, in Pro portion, than what is in India, and much lharper about the Point. The Mailer of the fbrenamed Ship brought alfoa black Fowl, as big in the Body as a large Duck. It had a long, ftraight, thick, but pointed Bill, and hol low Eyes, its Legs about iz or 14 Inches long, but thick and ftrong; it was very vo racious after Flelh or Fifli, and was an excel- lentFrog and Rat-catcher. AfToon as he caught any living Game, he toffed it up about two Yards high, and caught it on the Point of his Bill, and lb repeted his Toflings till the A- nimal dipd, and thxm greedily devoured it. Between Tlelagoa and Mojhmbique is a dangerous Sea-coaft, it formerly was known by the Names of Suffola and Cuama, but now by the Tortugueze, who know that Country bell, it is called Sena. It finds Dominions for many different Princes, for they are con tented with fmall Territories. The Inhabi tants are all Negroes, and almoft all Barbarians, except a few that the Tortugueze have con verted to Popery; and they, by their Con- yeriion, are generally lefs humane to luurope-' an Strangers than the Barbarians. ^ abounds in Elephants Teeth and low Gold, of 18 or 19 Caretts Finenefs; but the People having Plenty of all Things^ conveni ent for them, are very fupine. They have large flroi^g Bodies and Limbs, are ve? r yof the Eaft Indies. 9 ry bold in War. They'll have Commerce with none but the Tortugueze, who keep a few Priefts along the Sea-coafts, that over- aw the filly Natives, and get their Teeth and Gold for Trifles, and fend what they get to Mofambiojue, 1 have heard a Tortugueze fay, who went from Mofambique thither, that, carrying fome fmall Glafs-beads of divers Colours for Traffick, the Natives made a Hole in fome clay Ground, which would hold as many Beads as they wanted, and taking the Beads out of the Hole, filled it up with Gold- dull. He alfo told me, that for fome coarfe chequer'd Cloth, called Cambaya Lungies^ made ot Cotton-yarn, the Natives would bring Elephants Teeth, and meafure the Length of a Tooth by the Cloth, and bar tered the Tooth for fo much Cloth as it mea^ fured: But the c Portuguez&gt;e Relations are hardly to be credited, for if Gold and Teeth were fo eafily purchafed, how can they be fo miferably poor, as they are, every where in their Colonies, all over India ?■ I rather believe, that this was the Ophir or Tarjhijh of the Jews, whither Solomon fent his Ships out of the Red Sea, than Sumatra, where they could not poflibly go and return in three Years along the Sea-coafts, whict| might eafily be effeded to Sena, Mofambiqtie is an Ifland belonging to the Crown of 'Portugal, it is well fortified both by Art and Nature, but is very unwholfom, in fo much, that wben any Reynol, or Euro* peajiIO A new fean Tortugueze in the King of TortugaVs Ser vice in India, commits any capital Crime, in- Head of punifhing him according to their na tional or martial Laws, they are banilhed to Mofambique^ for as many Years as the Vice roy of Goa and his Council fliall order, and very few ever return from their Exile, for ^ or 6 Years is a long Life there. It alfo ferves for a refrefhing Place for the Tortugueze Ships, that are bound from Europe to India, where they generally flay about 30 Days to recruit their Soldiers and Sea-men, (not with frefti Numbers, but frelh Visuals and Whores) who, by their Inadivity and Lazi- nefs at Sea, contrad: the Scurvy and Dropfy, which the acid Fruits and nourilhing Roots foon difpel. Their Ships are generally at Se^ the whole Month of Augujly between Mo* fambique and Goa. The Inhabitants oi Mo fambique well as thofe on the Continent, are all Negroes, of a large Size, handfom, and very well limb'd, and make good Slaves. The King's Ships, as well as private Traders, bring good Store of them to India, both Sexes being in high E- lleem with the Indian Tortugueie, both hav ing Services,proper to their Sex, allotted them. AlFoon as the Boys can fpeak a little Tortu- gueze, they are baptized, and fo become ve ry zealous Catholicks, fit to execute any bafe Dclign their ghoftly Fathers (hall think fit to put them on ; and after Baptifm, they have a little Crucifix, or a Saint of Brafs or Ivory, bung about their Necks, which they are as fondof the Eaft Indies. n fond of, as a Monkey is of a young Kitten to play with. And fome that have the good Fortune to be young and docile, and fall into the Hands of a zealous fuperltitious Matter, are brought up to Letters, and in the End come to be Priefts. I have known many Coal-black Prielts about Goa. The Country of Quiloa lies between Mo~ famb'tqtie and Mombafs, its Sea-coaft is dan gerous, which admits of no Trade but in Boats. The Diftance between Mofambiqm and Mombafs is about ^^5' Leagues. Mombafs is alfo an Ifland that lies near the Continent, flightly fortified by Art, but very well by Nature ; it belonged to the Tortu* gueze for near 100 Years, but in Anno 1698. the Muskat Arabs took it with very little Trouble, and put about ^o Tortugueze to the Sword, that were there to defend it, and the Conquerors found a Booty of about 200 Tuns of Teeth, which was worth in India, a- bout ii^ooo L. Sterl. The Elephants of this Country are very large, and fo are the Men, who are all Barbarians, except thofe who were near Neighbours to the c Portugueze, who, for Conveniency, were baptized, and became good Catholicks; and fince the Ara bians are become their Neighbours, they arc turned very zealous Muflulmen, which Re ligion pleafes their Stupidity better, being better adapted to their Humours, and dear Cuftom of Polygamy and Concubinage. Tatta is now In the Hands of the Muskat Arabs 1iz A new Arahs^ and affords good Store of Teeth and Slaves for Muskat. Formerly the EnqJ.ijhy &lt; Portu«ueze^ndMoors from 7;/^,had a Imall, but advantagious Trade thither, which the rabs envied them of, and fent a Colony about the Year 1691. and fettled there, prohibiting Commerce with all other Nations. The in land Countries are inhabited by Barbarians, but on the Sea-coafls of Magadoxa^ Zeyla. and Teman to Cape Guardafoy, which llretch- es about 330 Leagues North. Eait-ward. The Religion, by Law eftablilhed, is Mahometau^ yet every Country retains fome Fragments of their ancient^Guftoms and Ceremonies, with the Traditions of their Fathers. The Ara- b'tans from Mocha, and other Parts of Arabia the Happy, who reckon themfelves Mahomet*$ beft Difciples. and who have travelled much to teach and confirm them in their Religion and Philology, declare them to b^ the great- eft Schifmaticks and obdurate Hereticks that profefs the Mahometan Religion. Magadoxa, or, as the Tortugueze call it, Magadocia, is a pretty large City, about - l or 3 Miles from the Sea, from whence it has a very fine Afpetf:, being adorn'd with many high Steeples and Mofques. There are feveral Reafons why Merchants do not frequent it on account of Traffick; one is, that a Reef of Rocks lies all along the Shore, about a Mile more or lefs from the fandy Strand, between which and the Rocks it is pretty fmooth, and two or three Fathoms Water; but there ip no River to fecure VelTels when a flrongof the Eaft Indies. I ^ Sea Wind bloweth. The fecond Impediment is, that Violence and Robberies are fo much pradifed and countenanced, that common Faith is not to be relied on: And I'll give a very tragical Inftance of their Barbarity^ viz. In Anno 1700. the Engl'tfh new Eaft-india Company lent out a Ship called the Albe marle, commanded by Captain Bea- wes. Being bound for Surat^ he had the Mif- fortune to meet the Eaiterly Monfoons or Trade-winds, fooner than he expeded. In the Chanel between Madagafcar and the Coaft otEthiqpia, thofe Eaflerly Monfoons always bring ftrong Currents with them from the Eaftward, which check'd him over to the Coaft of Magadoxa, but that being a danger rous Shore, he (tood over to the Illand of Jo* banna, and was forced to harbour his Ship on the South-weft Side of that Ifland, till the Eafterly Monfoons were blown over, and in the Month of March he ventured to put to Sea, which was too foon, becaufe the Currents ftill ran ftrong to the Weftward, and he ftanding over to the Ethiopian Coafl, fell in again with Magadoxa ; which, by the handfom Figure it made from the Sea, made him believe it to be fome Place of Commerce, and being curious to know if it was fo or no, fent his Yolealhore, with his Purferand four Seamen, to bring Information, and gave them llrid Orders to be on their Guard, and only one Perfon to go alhore at a Time. When the Boat got over the Rocks, they anchored clofe to the Beech, and the Natives cam^ from14 A new Account from the Town, driving Store of Cattle and Sheep before them for Sale. The Purler, be ing young, and unexperienced, forgot his Orders, and went afhore himfelf with three of his Crew, leaving one only to Hay in the Boat, and thofe that went afhore, were fo filly, as to leave their Fire-arms in the Boat, and by the feigned Civilities that the Natives fliew'd them, they heedlefly mingled them- felves with the Natives, who, finding fo un expected an Opportunity, hurl'd them away to the Town; and the Boat-keeper, neither hearing nor feeing what was done to his Com rades, fuffered fome Natives to come into the Boat, who feized him alfo, and haled the Boat a good W ay up on the Land. T h o s et on board the Ship, faw, by their Profpe^ives, what was afted afliore, and fent their other Boats, well mann'd, to try if they could ranfom the Captives, but in four Days fruitlefs Endeavours, they could never bring the Natives to a Parley, and fo the Ship was obliged to leave them to repent of their Fol ly ; but it never came to our Knowledge in India, what became of them, or what their Fate was. Yet on the Coafls of Zeyla and Teman, which both terminate at Cape Guardafoy, the Natives will bring off Sheep, Goats, Hens, Fiih and Fruits to fell to Shipping that fome- times ly becalm'd on their Sea, near the Shore. The People are tall, meagre and large bon'd, very fwarthy, but not quite black in their Complexions; they are treagherous, cruel, andof the Eaft Indies. ij and avaricious in their Temper; their Ha- bit is a Pair of Breeches to their Ancles, or a Piece of coarfe Cloth about their Loyns, and a Gown open before, and without Sleeves' called a Cam/in ; it is' made of Camels Hair, or of their Sheeps Wooll, that is ful ly as hard and coarfe as Hogs Hair. On their Heads they wear a Turbant of coarfe Cali co, and then they are equipped. Their Sheep are all white, with jet black Heads, and fmall liars, their Bodies large, and their Flefli de licate, their Tails as broad as their Buttocks, and about 6 or 8 Inches long ; fo they are in the Shape of a Pillow wanting Cor ners, and from the lower End of that Bundle, comes a fmall Tail about 6 Inches Ions, al- molt like a Pig's. And now having travelled along the Shore of the Continent, from the Cape of Good- hope to Cape Guardafoy, I'll furvey the I- flands that lie in the Ethidpuin Sea; but as they afford nothing for Commerce, but Slaves and Provifions, ttey are little minded by Merchants: So beginning with the Weftmoll, I'll bring them in Order to the Eaftward, CA new Account CHAP. n. Giving a Jhort 'Defcription of the IJlands in the Ethiopian Seas, with feme remarkable Taffages hiflorical and accidental, Madagascar, or, as the vortu- gueze chriflned it, St. Laurence, is one of the largeft Iflands in the known World, and affords mod Part of the Requifites of human Life: It produces very large Cattle, whofe Flelh is excellent, efpecially their large Humps that grow between their Neck and • Shoulders. They have alfo Goats and Deer plenty enough, and when the Tortugueze firft -failed along the Goafts of this Ifiand, they left a Brood of Hogs, that has mightily increafed. They alfo chriftned many Rivers and Gape- lands that are not now frequented, hut only known by their Names, and ferve for Nefts to Pirates. The French made a Settlement on the Eaft Side of it, and called it Tort ^Dau- fhin ; but finding that the Commerce there would not bear the Expence of the Colony, they left it again. The Englijh formerly drove a Trade for Slaves on the Weft Side of the Ifland, par ticularly at St. Augujtines Bay, and at new and old Mejfalige, but now they are afraid of tbe Pirates, tho' fome venture their Necks in going to trade with them. ' There have been feveral Squadrons of Britijh Men of War fent to cruize on the Pirates, but have had ve ry ill Succefs in finding them out 5 but one Scotsof the Eaft Indies. f ?

In Anno lyix. Mr. Matthews weilt in Quefl of them, but found they had deferted the Illand of St. Marys, leaving behind them fome Marks of their Robberies,- for in fome Places they found Pepper a Foot thick, lying on the Ground in the open Air. The Com modore aforefaid went with his Squadron o- ver to the main Illand, but the Pirates had carried their Ships into Rivers or Creeks, out of Danger of the Men of War, and to offer to burn them with their Boats, would have been impracticable, fincethey could have ea-* illy diftreffed the Boats Crews out of the Woods. The Commodore had fome Difcourfe with fome of them, but they ftood on their Guard, ready to defend themfelves, if any Violence had been offered them. I have heard it reported by fome who had frequented Madagafcar for Trade, that the Natives that live 'far from the Sea, are of a tawny Complexion, and have long Hair on their Heads, whereas thofe that are born near the Sea, are very black, and their Hair like Lamb-wooll. What Religion they profefs, I know not, and the Pirates are but fcurvy School-mailers to teach them Morals. T here are many lilands and Sholes lying to the Eaftward of Madagafcar. St. AfoLloni is uninhabited ; c Domafcarenhas is inhabited by the French, but formerly by the Engl'tfh, and was called by them. The KngUflfcitiy'g//.

There are two memorable Accidents fell out at that llland, to the Englijh Eaft-tndta Company's Shipping. One was in the Year 1600 or 91 to Captain Burton in the Herbert, a Ship of Hcorons, mounted 56 Guns. He was attack ed by three French Ships, each gunn'd and main d as well as he. On their Approach, he P ul: to Sea^ about x af-^ 1 ^ 0C J n n tl l ey .. began an ' 10t Engagement; wfench lafted till 8 in the Night,. that the Herbert blew up, and all her Men loft but 6 or 7 that were in the Pinnace, fome whereof I faw afterwards -at Muskat, The other was lately, i;/ Anno tjio. when two 0 .* ? ur ^dji-tnatd Ships were watering there, w ith an Oft end Ship in their Company; they ^ i Agreed2.0 d ww Account agreed to (land by one another in cafe of Af- - faults, or engaging with the common f-ne- my, but when two Pirates drew near, the Greenwich and Oftender weighed, and Itood to Sea, and left the Cafandra to fliift for her felf, who was obliged to engage the Imallelt Pirate (being a Ship of X4 Guns, 'Dutch-bunt) in the Bay, and foon after they began, the Cafandra went aground on fome Rocks, and the Pirate flriving to board her, was alio ta ken up by fome Rocks, not above io i ai ds from the Caffandra. The Pirate's Head lay to wards the Cafandra s Broadfide, and they pel ted one another furioufly, many falling on both Sides, but the Pirates, finding too hot Work on their Decks, were forced to quit them, and run down into the Hold for ter. Captain Mackraw^ who commanded the Cajfandra, feeing the other Pirate approach near him, and manning all his Boats to rein force his Comrade, thought it a good Time for him, and who elfe could get aihore, to embrace the Opportunity, and accordingly they got into their Boats, and faved their Lives.' The Inhabitants Ihewed much Huma nity to the DUtreffed, and carried them a- bove a Dozen of Miles up in the Country, for Fear the Pirates, in their mad t ury, fliould have murdered the poor Men that efcaped from their Ship. The Pirates, loon after they had PoiTeffion of the Cajfandra, got her a- flote again, ilie having received little or no Damage; they alfo got their own Ship off, but2.1 -d iww Account ligion of thofe Hlands is Mahometan, but there are very few Zealots among them; and fo I leave theni, and return to Cape Guardafoy, and travel up the Red Sea. ' T h e Navigation of the Ethiopian Seas is very dangerous, and their Maps very detici- ent; for I faw a 'Butch Skipper at Mocha, who had Orders to fail from Batavia to wards Mocha, in the Month oi January, and to navigate to the North End of Madavafcar, and from thence to the Red Sea, he affirmed to me, that he faw feveral large lilands, and many Rocks and Sands in thofe Seas that were not placed in his Maps, for which Reafon he was obliged to anchor in the Nights, when he could have Anchor Ground; and that the Currents run very ftrong to the Southward, ^mong thofe Banks and Rocks. m ^ af ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ @ ^ ^ ^ ^ ® ^ ^ * s- CHAP. III. Gives a c Defcription of ZeylaV Sea-coafl, and of a Tart of Ethiopia, Zuakin and Upper Egypt. 1 J U T to return again to Cape Guarda- fj foy, from thence up to Zeyla is about ixo Leagues. The Coail is inhofpitable as well as the People. There are only two Pla ces in all that Traft that affords frefli Water, one is a little to the Eaftward of Mount Fe lix, but in Arabick it is called Baba-fileck, or. The Mountain ofQameh, where there is^ ^ Eaft Indie/. a fmall frefli Water River; the other is cal led Khagi 10 Leagues more Wefterly; it may be eafily known by the Side of a Hill clofe to the Sea, whofe North Afpeft is of white Sand, that Ihews at a Diftance like a Sail, but may be feen in that Figure 10 Leagues oil. Several Ships from that have been neceflitated to call at thofe Places for Water, have been cut off; and one poor Man they fur- prized with his own Boat that he fent for Wa ter. The Boat's Crew were furprized whiilt lilhng Water, them they killed, except two Boys whom they faved; they then came off in the Night, and thofe in the Ship not exa mining them in Time, they boarded the Ship, and took them all unarmed, and killed every .Man, and carrying the Ship dole to the Shore, they unladed her, and then funk her. The two Youths who gave the Account of that tragical Accident, were brought to which lies oppoiite to that Place, and were fold for Slaves, A Surat Ship being there, bought the Yoi4ths, and brought them to Su rat. T here is no anchoring on that Coaft a- bove a Mile off Shore the Sea is fo deep ; and above ZeyU, in a deep Bay oppofite ta Babelmandel, which makes the Entry into the Red Sea, there is a large River that dif- imbogues into the Sea, but tho' the Moutfi be large, yet it is fo deep, and full of Banks and Rocks, with fuch \V hirl-pools, that' no Ship dare go near it. At that River begins the Ethiopian Shore, Ihewing manv high. B 4 IVlouriTu ^ new Account Mountains, which are eafily feen from th^ Arab'tayi Shore: And all the Coaft from this River, as far North as Zuakin, which is near 100 Leagues, is called the Ethiopian Coaft. And tho' I never was on that South-weft Coaft of the Red Sea, and know but few that traffick there, except Romijh Priefts, yet I'll venture to relate what I learned from them. There are two or three fmall Ports between Zeyla and Mojfava, but an inconfiderable Trade, being moft in Slaves of both Sexes, which the Ethiopians bring to Mocha for a Market, where f have feen a Drove of thofe unfortunate Creatures carried like a Flock of Sheep, moft Part of them infenfible of their own Mifery, and the higheft Bidder carries the Bargain. They alfo bring fome Elephants Teeth, the beft that ever I faw, and fome O ftriches Feathers. Mojfava is fituated on the North-weft Fnd of a large Ifland, and affords a very good Harbour for Shipping of any Size; it has a Garifon of about 15-0 Turks in a Caftle built formerly by the Tortugueze, who, ac cording to their impolite Cuftom, opprefs Strangers as well as Natives, that come there to trade. T h e Country produceth low Gold, Ele phants Teeth, Slaves, and fome Coffee, but of a larger Grain than what grows on the Land oppofite to it in Arabia, at Betlefac- he. The current finall Money of Ethiopia is Salt, which is dug out of the Mountains we do Stones from our Quarries, Whichof the fcaft Indies. they brfeak in Pieces of feveral Sizes, the lar- gelt weighing about 80 Pounds, the others in o, io, 10, or 5' Pounds, and are fo expert in ividing it, that they err not above 5 per Cent, more or lefs in their Calculation of VV eight; 2,0 Pounds is in Value about 1 Shil ling and thofe Pieces of Salt is thecur- icnt Money in their Markets for Provifions, and likewife for Cloth, when they buy a Yard or two at a Time ; and when a Merchant has got any confiderable Quantity by him, there are Bankers to give Gold for it. The Religion on the Sea-coaft is Maho- rnetan, but within Land Cophties^ who are circumcifed Chr 'tft 'tans, The Males they cir- cumcife fometimes at 8 Days old, but that Cei cmony is often delayed till 40 Days, and lometimes not till the feventh or eighth Year of their Age. They circumcife Females as well as Males. TheCircumcifion, they think, is ne- cefTary in Memory of J ejus Chriji^ and on .1 certain Day yearly, they immerfe themfelves in Rivers or Lakes, in Remembrance of Chrifts Immerfion or Baptifm. They forbear eating fome Beafts Flein, according to the Mofakal Law. They hold from Saturdays Noon to Sunday's Noon their Sabbath. They receive the Sacrament ftanding, and only in the Church, and the Wine only from the Deacon's Hand in a Spoon. Their Priefts eat no idle Bread, but maintain themfelves by La bour. They have many Biftiops, but one they call Abunah above the reft, he is held in great Veneration, and when he goes abroad^ het6 A new Account has great Attendance, and rides on a Mule, with a Crofs in his right Hand. They enter their Churches bare-footed, becaufe God commanded Mofes to put off his Shoesy for the Ground he flood on was holy. They allow but one Wife, but as manyCon^ cubines as they pleafe. They allow of Re pudiation, but neither Party can marry again, till the Term of three Years be expired, and if the Parties are not reconciled in that Te?m, they think the Breach too big ever to be do- fed up again. T hey have all the canonical Books of our Scriptures, and feveral more. They reck on the Prophet Iddo one of the greater Pro phets, and put him in the Clafs with Ifaiah r Ezekiely Elijha^ Elijah and l^aniely and that he wrote 14000 Prophecies, many of which 'lis Day; that his Prophecies Itmtt than any the other Prophets left be hind them; but the Subftance of their practical Religion confifls in their Fafts and Feafts, for they do not much trouble themlclves about the Dodrine of Faith, Repentance and good Works, which makes them very difTolute in their Lives. W e Europeans generally call the King of Ethiopia, 'Prefer John, but his Subjefts know no luch Appellation; 'tis true, he is Supreme in ecclefiallick as well as civil Affairs. His Do minions are very large, and he has many Tri butaries, who flile themfelves Kings, and aft dcfpotically. The Royal Family are all kept were clearer, or more di- at19 tf the Eaft Indies. Tj at Amara, which is a pleafant round Hill, fi- tuated in ix Degrees North from the Equa tor , tho 1 I faw an old 'Portugue&amp;e geographi cal Defcription of Ethiopia, place it under the Equinottial. The Hill is walled round With a high Wall, at lead ix Leagues in Cir cumference, which cuts off all Communica tion with Strangers or Mal-contents. With in the Walls are Palaces, Gardens, Orchards, Woods for wild Game, Rivulets and Ponds for Fiih, and all that the Clime can afford to make it^ pleafant ; there the Youths of the Royal Family ftudy what Arts and Sciences are proper to their Quality, or according to the Knowledge of their Teachers, T heir Empire is hereditary, but not in a dired Line, the Succeflion being kept in the ancient Family, which they reckon up as high as Solomon, but on the Demife of one Em peror, they make Choice of a Royal Youth out of the Paradife of Amara, fo he that be haves beft in that State of Probation, or has the beft Friends to recommend him, fucceeds without Contention, which political Cuftom makes theirYouths very tradable and ftudious. There are none reckoned Princes of the Blood after fecond Coufm-germans, and it feems they have fomething like the Salick Law in Force amongft them, for their Hiftories mention no Female Reign fince Candaces Time, if E- thlopia, as it now is, was her Country. They are very nefty in their Apparel and Diet, for tho' their Country is well ftored with Fire-wood, yet they do not take Pains18 A new Account todrefs their Meat by Fire, but having kil led their animal Food, before it be well rold, they mince it, and mix Salt and a fliarp hot Bark of a Tree well powdered, and make the Morfel up in fmall Balls about the Bignefs of a Wall-nut, and greedily eat it: But the Princes eat in State, for they being feated on a Matt fpread on the Ground, his favourite female Slave or Concubine makes up thofe Ballsof Flelhor Filh feafoned with the afore- faid Sauce of Salt and Bark, and fqueezes them into fafhionable Morfels, his Highnefs gapes like a young Grow, and ihe throws it cle verly in, which he prefently devours. The Commons eat of the fame Sort of \ iands with the Grandees, but many of both Sexes die by Excoriations of the Guts and the right Inte- (tine; but whether their Diet be the Caufe of their Diftemper, I leave to Phylkians to determine, who generally are the beit Judges. They have a good pleafant Liquor made of Hony and Potatoes, which they caroufe in plentifully, and often get drunk by it, and then they are rather mad than inebriated, which renders them very quarrelfom and fu rious ; their Hony, as it is very plentiful in their Country, fo it is the whiteft, hardeft and bell tafled that ever I met with. I had the above Relation of Abajina from ioux Rvmijh Priefls, who had their Million there for 8 Years together, but made but ftw Profelytes: They had been meddling in State Affairs, and, for Fear of lofing their Heads, they fled, and left two of their Brethren, be ingof the Eaft Indies. 19 ing old, and not fit for Travel; what became of them they knew not; but thofe four tranf- greffed their Superior's Orders, and left their Stations, and travelled three or four hundred Miles to the Sea-coaft, and got a Paflage o- ver the Red Sea to Mocha, where I entertain ed them about four Months: They alfo told me, that feven tributary Kings had loft their Heads in fix Months Time, Tor Mal-admini- ftration or Treafon, and if my Guefts had not removed their Quarters when they did, they had been honoured with the Name of Roman Martyrs, in Anno 1714. The Coun try abounds plentifully in Wheat, Rice, Bar ley, Legumens or Pulie of feveral Sorts, not- withftanding they eat their raw Meat with out Bread. Their Woods abound in Ele phants (reckoned the krgeft in the World) alio fome Lions and Tigers, and innume^ rable Troops of Wolves, Monkeys and O- ftriches, all much larger than in other Coun tries. The aforefaid Priefts alfo told me, that the Head of Nilusy which the Ancients fo much fought for, is in this Country, about the Latitude of 6 Degrees North, and about 400 Miles from the lower End of the Red Sea, How far the Ethiopian Coaft ftretches to the North-ward, I know not, but it has no Sea^ ports to the Northward of Moffava, and the next Country to it is the barbarous Zuakin, whofe Inhabitants are very different both in Complexion and Cuftoms from the Abafinu, whofe Colour is only as black as Soot, but the50 new Account the Zuakins are as black as Jet, and their Skins as foft as Velvet. Their Religion is ftill Paganifm, tho* they don't worfliip Images. They fliew out ward Civility to Europeans, but kill them, and feaft on their Flefli, when any are unfor tunately fhipwrack'd on their Coaft. At firft they fhew a feeming Humanity, allowing them a convenient Place to lodge in, with Plenty of animal Food to eat, and fometimes en tertain them with their Mufick, and then de- flroy the fatteft, as they have Occafion to feaftonthem, an Inftance whereof I had from a Miflionary at Mocha, in Anno 1712. viz. A Turkijh Galley bound from MoJJava to Judda in Arabia fclix, had on board about 10 European Turks, and one Italian Prieft, as PalFenger; that Galley was drove afliore on the Coaft of Zuakin by a Storm, the Gal ley was loft, but all the Men got fafe afliore, and found the abovementioned Entertain ment. They had not been long alhorej till fome People of Diftin^Hon vifited them, and feemed to condole their Misfortune, but with al, told them in Arabick, that the King had a great Defire to fee fome of them, and they chofe the youngeft and plumped of the Turks to fhew to the King, who very willingly went away with them, but none came back to bring News how they were entertained at Court; and every fourth or fifth Day, an other of the beft favoured and beft flelhed were carried from ^heir Comrades^ on the fame, or fuch like Errand, till near one Half wereof the Eaft Indies. Were carried away, thofe that remained had no Sufpicion, but were lulled afleep by the good Words and good Treatment they re ceived daily 4 . But one Day, an Ahafine, who had fled his Country for fome Mifdemeanour, came to vifit them, and, in Difcourfe, they told him how courteoufly they had been en tertained by the hoipitable Natives, and how many of their Company had gone to the King, but that none returned. The Abafine toid v them, that they were treated after the com mon Cultom of that Country, that when a- ny white Men were ihipwrack'd on their Coall, they found fuch Treatment as they had, to make them fat, and then to kill and eat them, by cutting fuch Morfels of the Bo dy as they had prefent Occafion for, and kept Life as long in the poor Vi(Sim as they could; and that very Morning a Janifary had been carried on the aforefaid Errand, and had one Leg cut off, and the Half of a Thigh, and he faw them rolling and broiling the Flefh as he happened to pafs in his AV ay to vifit them, and told the difconfolate Turks that remained, that if one or two would ac company him a little Way in the Evening, he would convince them of the Truth ot that he told them, but they muft immediately after return to their Lodging. The Pried was one that went to behold the fad Speftacle, whom they found not quite dead, tho fpeechlefs, on which the Abafine went fpeedily away, as the others did to acquaint their Fellows what they had feen. Alibon as they made their Re- port.32* A new Account port, they were under the greatefl Confter- nation, and unaniiaoufly relblved to flee to the Woods that very fame Night, and truft the wild Inhabitants rather than the crueller BeaftS) the Zuaktns. And the Woods are plentifully inhabited with Lions, Tigers, large Monkeys, but above all with Wolves. The Prieft took his Way in the Dark along the Sea-fhore to the Northward, but knew nothing of his Fellows, which Way they took, or how they fared. In the Day-time he fculked in Caverns and Hollows of Rocks^ which that Sea-coaft abounds in, and is not fo much frequented by the brutal Cannibals as the inland Parts; fometimes he fallied out to get Shell-fifh, or what elfe he could get t6 eat, and in the Night he travelled, fo that af ter fevcnteen Nights and Days hard Fatigue^ he arrived at a Village in ^Ofper Egypt inha bited by Mahometans and Cofhties, who re lieved him, and fent him to Grand Cairo, from whence he wrote to a Miflionary at Mocha, in Anno 1714. who refided with me, and gave him the above Account, with the Addition of a very llrange Paradox, viz. That himfelf being then about x8 Years of Age^ ( when he fell on the Coaft of Zuakiu ) his Hair was of a dark brown, but when he arrived in Cairo, his Hair was turned to a ve ry light gray, and continued fo till the Time he wrote to his Friend at Mocha of that tra-* gical Adventure. There are no Sea-ports from Zuakin on the South-weft Side of the Red Sea, till we comeof the Eaft Indies. ^ come w Seues, which lies near the Head of the Bay of that Sea, which fends his oppofitd onores down to the Sorlth-eaftward^ as far as ■t&gt; abelmandel. Sues, ox Seues feems to be the Ezion-ve- frerj or Eloth, from whence Solomon fent hi^ onips io Ophir , for I have converfed withfe- veial Pilots of that Navigation, who afTur- e r rnc ' t ' ere ^ no clean Bottom fof Ancho^ ring, but Seues, on that Part of the Coaft, ^ &gt;art R e dSea is incumbred with Coral Rocks under Water,&gt; and pefte- red with Banks, which make the Navigation very dangerous. At prefent, Seues is the on ly oea-port for Grand Cairo, from whence it is three Days Journey by Land, with a Caf^ nlla or Caravan, but on Horfe-back but two' iliort Days. In Cairo the Enghjh and French keep their Confuls, for the Support of the Trade of their refpeftive Countries. In Anno 17 ^ r - Harrington was Conful for the Englijh, he had a very fair Charafter trom all People, as well Merchants as the Religious that came from Cairo to Mocha^ which made me prefufne to trouble hfim with a Letter, giving him the befl Account I could of the State of Merchandize in India^ and to have his Advice, whether it might be practicable to cultivate a Trade from Indict to Seues, which Letter he very civilly an- fwered, and next Year ft came to my Hand; but he diiTwaded me from any Attempt that Way; becaufe of the intolerable Avarice ani Infults of the Tnrkijh Ba/haws, and other' t 1 C Officer?*4 w® -Account Officers of Note, with the Contempt they have for Merchants, efpecially Chrijiians, he aflured me, that it is impoffible to be a Gai ner by fuch Commerce. CHAP. IV. Gives a Little T&gt;efc rift ion of the Co aft of A- rabia the Happy, from Mount Sinai to Mo cha, with fome Obfer vat ions on the Religion, Cuftoms and Laws, as they are now efta- hltjhed. OV E R ag.ainfl Seues, on the Arabian Shore, (lands Mount Sinai, about $ or 6 Leagues from the Sea ; and on its South- welt Side, near the Bottom, is the Monaitery of St. Katharina. The Mount is much rever ed by the Jews, and the Monaftery by the Chrifltans ; it is very ancient, and held in fome Veneration by the Mahometans, whofe Pilgrims to Mecca, from Egypt, Turkey and ^Pale/line, pafs clofe by, both in their go ing and returning, as do likewife their Caml- las, and other PalFengers, that go on Traf- fick to Judda, a City four Days Journey from Mecca, where Mahomet lies interred: And the great Concourfe of Pilgrims ( from all Parts where his Religion is fpread) brings a great Trade thither. There is a Tradition, that, as Mahomet was going on an Expedition to Taleftine, he called at that Monaflery for Refrefliments, and the&amp;/ the Eaft Indies. ^5 the Monks generoufly allifted him ; and in Acknowledgment of their Civility, he gave tnem a Charter, which they Hill keep, where in he gave them many Immunities, and laid his heavy Curfe on all, Ihould, after that Time, dare to molell that Monaflerv. The building is ftrong and high, and' no u- e i 0 A' Do01 ; t0 enter in to h, but one, whtch ftands about ten Yards high (in the , fr o m the Ground. It has a large In- cloiure adjoymng to it, with an high Wall, to Keep the wild from robbing them of their animal Provilions ; for they are fueh vile Thieves, that they had rather venture to ly under the Anathema of their Prophet than to keep their Hands from Robbery. * 1 r s prefent Poileffors are Neftorian and Jacobin Monks, who are maintained by the C laiity of Pailengers, and a little Revenue that belongs to the Monallery. The Chnfti- ms, in that Part of Arabia, are Neftorians and Jacobins, whofe Prielts may marry, and they allow of no Images but the Crofs, and many other Things repugnant to the Romifh 1 enets. Judda is the next Place of Note below St. Kat bar in a. It isafmall, but well fortified Ci ty, belonging to the Turk. It ftands clofe to the Sea, and is governed by a Bafliaw, who keeps aGarifonin it, with four or five Gal leys to cruize on the Red to hinder the Palling of all Ships or Veffels up the Sea without firft calling at J t • C a The56 new Account Thf inland Country about it, belongs to a Sheek, who pretends to be a Defeendant of Mahomet. He has the Title of Xeriff gi ven him, to diflinguilh his Eminency from other Sheeks. And, aitho' he be lo near a^ kin to the Prophet, yet he fqueeies above looooo Pounds Sterl. yearly out of the Pil grims, who go to worfhip at his Anceftor's Tomb. And fo much Gain he can make ot their Folly. 11 is between this Country and Sinai, that the famous Balm of Gilead grows. It is re ported to proceed from a Shrub, the Bark of which is flit, and Velfels fet under the Wound to receive it, as it drains from that Wound. The wild Arabs about Sinai, have a Tradition, that Abraham was their Country man, and are not a little proud of that Ho nour i but if it was fo, that he was their Sheek, as they alledge, they neither follow him in Morals or Religion. The Sea-coafts of Arabia felix, from Jud* da to the Southward, as far as the Latitude of 15 Degrees, are governed by feveral Sheeks, who are fo avaritious, that no Pil grims can pafs through their Dominions, but Beggars; for if Strangers carry any Thing of Value about them,, or if they have good Clothes, they are llript of all, and about a Yard of coarfe Cloth given them to cover their Nakednefs \ and Ledures of Humility and Devotion are preached to them, that whoever goes on fo folemn an Errand, ought to fliew, by their outward Appearance, thatof the Eaft Indies. ^*7 the inward Man is humble, and that thofe who love Riches, ought to fequefter them- felves from the World, before they approach that holy Place, where, after the Muftee (or his Deputy, the Fackee) had beftowed a Be nediction on them, if they had any Grace, they would never covet Riches again. The hnmaum of Mochas Dominions reach along the Sea-coart from the Latitude of 15' Degrees, to the Southward, as far as Ba- belmandel, very barren and inhofpitable, af fording neither frefli Water, nor Wood for Shipping, either for Drink or Fuel. Only on the I Hand of Commera, which lies about 5' or &lt;5 Leagues from Betlefackee, there is both a good Harbour, and Plenty of Provi- fions for Strangers, as well as for the Inha bitants, whofe Temperance makes them eafi- ly fatisfied, both with their coarfe Diet and Apparel. BetLefackee is the fir ft Town of Note ( near the Sea-coaft ) of the lmmaum\ Domi nions. It (lands about 25 Englijh Miles from the Sea, and it is the greatell Market for Coffee in the World. It fupplies India; Ter- fla, Turkey in Afia^ Africa and Europe, be- iides England, France and Holland, with Coffee-beans. Other Goods and Merchandize may be bought and fold on Credit, for a certain Time; but Coffee is always bought for ready Money. The Europe Shipping lades yearly at Mocha, (from whence Betlefackee is about 100 Engltjh Miles ) about 2000 Tuns, rather more than lefs, and the other C 3 Nations58 A new A Nations above 20000 Tuns more. The whole Province of Betkfackee is planted with Cof fee Trees, which are never fuffered to grow above 4 or 5 Yards high; and the Bean or JBerry grows on the Branches and T wigs, fir ft green, then red, at laft a dark brow T n Co- Jour. The Berries cling to the Branches like fo many Infeds, and when they are ripe, they fliake off. Zibet is the next Town, and ferves for a Sea-port for Betlefackee. It was large, and famous in ancient Times for Trade, but in the fourteenth Century, the Turks over-ran all the Coaits of the Red Sea, and made them Tributaries to them. They ruined all the Trade from India to Zibet, and fettled their Emporium at Aden, about 35* Leagues with out Btibelmandel, to the Eaftward: And the Immaum holds his Kingdom in Feoff from the Turk at this Time; and when the Turks come to Betlefackee, none dare break the Price of the Market, nor buy before they are firfl; ferved. Th e Immaum or King keeps his Court ge nerally at a Town called Mohaib, about 2 .00 Engiijh Miles to the Eatt, North-eaftward of Mocha, He has little Splendor about it, and he that reigned in Anno 1714, was about 80 Years of Age. His Government has been of a long Time very ill managed. His Luft having the Afcendant over his Reafon, he had feldom lefs than Three hundred Wives married to him, of the mod beautiful young Women in his Dominions, He often marries one.of the Eaft Indies. one, at one New-moon, and, on the next New-moon, remarries her to one of his Mi nions, and beflows a good Patrimony on her to help her off; fo that with his own fre quent Marriages, and thofe of his Minions, he exhauffs all his Revenues, and is always neccuitous, which forces him on many unjuil and mean Ways to exaft Money from his mi- lei able Subjects. And, in Anno 1720. their heavy Burdens made them rebel, and in volved the whole Country in a civil War. One Part was fordepofing him, and another keeping him on the 1 hrone ; but what the Event was I never heard. The Turkshemg baffled infeveralProjeds and Expeditions from ylden^ and that they could not well maintain their Ground in thai- Part of Arabia, ( being fo very far diftant from their own Dominions) without much Charge and Trouble, they, in the latter End of the fixteenth Century, withdrew their Garifon from Aden, and left it, with all its oi tifications and iiuildings, to x\\Qlw2ma7wi* who finding Aden to ly inconvenient for the Trade of the Red Sea, becaufe of the frefli Winds ufually blowing at its Mouth, in both Eafterly and Wefterly Monfoons, made him remove the Trade about 15 Leagues within its Mouth, in a Bay. not very com modious for Shipping, to a Fiihing Town called Mocha, Chap.40 A nm Account CHAP. V. Gives a Tiefcription of the Tmmaiim of Mo- chaV Country) farticularly of Mocha its Situation^ Laws, Cuftoms and Commerce ; with fome hi for teal Obfervations, MOCHA, upon the foregoing Account, was built for an Emporium or Mart for the Trade of India to the Red Sea, and was mightily forwarded by the Perfwafion of a Sheek, who bore the Charadter of a Saint amongll his Country-men. His Name was Sheek Seddley ; and he pretended to prophe- fy, that Mocha fhould be a Place of great Trade to the Country, and confequently of great Profit to the Immaum. They had fuch a Veneration for him, that the greatell Mofque in the Town, and the greatell Gate, bear his Name, and did, even in his own Lifetime, fee the Town walled, tho ? hut ve ry weakly. It is fituated clofe to the Sea, in large, dry, fandy Plain, that affords no good Water within 2.0 Miles, all the Wells nearer the City being brakifh, fo that nothing of Fruits grows near it, but a few Dates and Water Melons. The Water for drinking comes from Mo fa, about 10 Miles off, as I faid before, and by that Time we get it to the Town, it cofts us as dear as fmali Beer, is fold for in England. Thofe who are obli ged to drink of the Wells near the Town, are in Danger of having a long fmall Worm b&lt;eed in their Legs or Feet, that inflamesof the Eaft Indies. iff the Place where it breeds, which is accom panied with extreme burning Pains. In 5' or 6 Days it appears between the Cutany and outward Skin, and then puts its Head thro', which when the Patient obferves, he takes hold of it with a Pair of Tweezers, and pulls it very gently out, about an Inch or two at a Time, in 24 Hours, and rolls it round an Hen's Quill, or fome other Thing of that Thicknefs. It is no thicker than the Treble String of a Violin; and I have feen of them, after they have been pulled out, about two Foot and an half long. While it is in the Leg, it is daily covered with a Plaifter, and, if it chance to break in the Operation, the Patient will be troubled with intolerable Pains for a long While; and fometimes they are crippled by it. But the Mofa Water, co ming from Springs amongft the Mountains, is very fweet and wholefom. Mocha is a Place of good Trade, not with- ftanding its bad Situation; for, befides the Commerce with Sues and Judda, the En- glijh and 'Dutch Companies have their Fa- dories there, befides a Trade from India, carried on by Englijh free Merchants, Tor- tugueze. Banyans and Moors, and by VelTels from Bo (for ah, ^Perfia and Mnskat in Arabia fetrea. The Country, ofitfelf, affords or pro duces r iluable Commodities, be- Myrrh, Olihanum or Frankincenfe from QaJJin, and Aloes Soccatrina from Soccotra liquid Storax, white and yellow Arfen^ck, iides fome Drugs, fuch as fome42. new Account fome Gum Arabick and Mummy; with fome Balm of Gilead, that comes down the Red Sea. The Coffee Trade brings in a continu al Supply of Silver and Gold from Eurofe, Spanifh Money, German Crowns, and other European Coins of Silver ; alfo Zequins, German and Hungarian Ducats of European Gold; and from Turkey^ Ebramies and Mo-^ grabies. Gold of low Matt. The Pirates, for many Years, infefted the Mouth of the Red Sea, committing frequent Robberies and Barbarities. Captain Evory was the firft that led the Way, in Anno 1695'. and the Pirates finding great Booties, pur- tfiafed with fmall Danger, from the Traders into the Red Sea, had a Projeft to be Ma ilers of the Key of that Door, fo they found the Ifland Trim, which lies within Gun-lhot of Babelmandeh to have a good commodious Bay for the Security of their Shipping; upon which Confideration, they began to build re gular Fortifications, and dig for frefli Wa ter, and, with much Labour, they dug thro* an hard Rock, 15* Fathoms deep, but found none, but brakifh Water; wherefore they defiiled, and removed to St. Marys, Ifland, on the Eait Side of Madagafcar, as I obferv- ed before, and are fince removed, for more Security, over to the main Ifland, and there they fortify themfelves by Marriages into the noble Families of that great liland, from whence they come into India, and cruize in thofe Seas. In Anno 1696. they met with a 3hip from Bombay, commanded by one^^- bridge,of the Eaft Indies. 45 bridge^ who was carrying Arabian Horfes for Surat. After they took the Ship, Saw^ bridge began to expollulate with them about their Way of Life. They ordered him to hold his Tongue, but he continuing his Dif- courfe, they took a Sail-needle and Twine, fewed his Lips together, and fo kept him fe- veral Hours, with his Hands tied behind him. At length they unloofed both his Hands and Lips, and carried him on board their Ship, and, after they had plundred Sawbrtdges Ship, they fet her on Fire, and burned her and the Horfes together. Saw bridge and his People were fet afhore near Aden^ where he died prefently after. Captain Evory was not fo inhumane; for the Year before, he took a large Ship belong ing to the Moguls and got a Booty of x6ooooo Rupees, which amount to, in Sterling Mo ney, about 325'ooo Pounds. He freed the Ship, and let her go, without torturing the People; but carried a young Mogul Lady with him, and fome of her female Servants, who had been at Mecca to perform a Vow, laid on her by her Mother on her Death-bed. But , to return again to Mocha, from my long Digreffion: The Town is large, but meanly fortified ; and, from the Sea, it has a fine Afped. The Buildings are lofty, and make a much better Appearance without than within. ^ The Steeples of five or fix Mofques raife their Heads pretty high above the reft of the Buildings. Their Markets are well ftored with animal Provifions, fuch as Beef a Mutton44 -d new Account Mutton of Sheep and Goats, Lamb and Kid, Camel and Antelopes Flelh, Dung^hill Fowls, Guinea Hens, Partridge and Pigeon. The Sea affords Variety of Filli, but not favoury. I believe their Unfavourinefs proceeds from the extreme Saltnefs of the Sea-water, and the Nature of their Aliment. The Town is well furnifhed, all the Year round, with good Fruits, fuch as Grapes, Peach, Apricocks and Quinces, of which they make Store of Mar- melade, both for their prefent Ufe and Ex portation, tho* near the Town, there is not a Tree or Shrub to be feen, but a few Date Trees. And they fcldom have more than two or three Showers of Rain in a Year, and of ten no Rain in two or three Years; but a- mongfl the Mountains, about 20 Miles off, feldom a Morning pafTes without a moderate Shower, which makes the Vallies very pro- lifick in Fruit and Corn, fuch as the Soil will bear; but they have no Rice, tho' Plenty of Barley and Wheat. The Governor of Mocha, and the Offi cers of the Town, are Merchants, when they think to get good Bargains, and are very rea^- dy to break their Contrads, both in Pay ment of their Debts, and in the Time of Pay ment. Some Inilances whereof I faw. And, in Anno 1716.1 had an experimental one; for the Deputy-governor having bought a Part of my Cargo, agreed to pay me the firft Day of June, according to our/Errand Compu tation. At the appointed Time I demanded my Money ; but he told me, that notwich-of the Eaft Indies. ^ ftanding he had agreed at that Time to pay me, yet the Cultom was not to pay before the Middle ot July, and Cuftom muil be obferved before Contrad; befides, the Kin^ having much Need of Money, fent Dreffing Demands on the Town for Money, as faft as it came in by Cuftoms and other Subfidies; therefore he couid not, nor would not pay tne before the cuftomary Time, nor would he clear my Account Cuftoms (which is a Part of his Office) before that Time. I often folicited him to clear my Account, and pay the Balance; but to no Purpofe. I then fell on a Projed to frighten him into Compli ance. ^ I went very calmly to him, and told him, that I had fome Goods left, which would be proper for the inland Markets, and that I would let him have a Penyworth of them. He knew the Goods were proper enough, as I had told him, and fo came to my Houfe, which was four Stories high. I carried him up to the highefl) and, having feated him in a fmall Balcony, I Ihewed him the. Multers of my Goods, and askt Prices which he thought too high; and, becaufe we could not agree, he was for going abruptly away, and fo got on his Feet: But I being much too ftrong for him, took him by the Shoulders, and forced him to fit down again, and orde red my Linguift to tell him, that, before we parted, he muft clear my Account Cuftoms, and give me Bills, on the King's Banker, for the Balance, otherwile I would teach him to fly from the Balcony to the Ground, be the Confequence4,6 A new Account Confequence what it would. He had never been fo treated before, and Fear feized him fo, that he could not fpeak for a little Time, but, recovering a little, ordered his Clerk, who was in the Room with us, to make up my Account, and draw Bills immediately, who readily obeyed Orders; and, in Half an Hour, we became good Friends again. The Noife of this Aftion run like a Squib thro' the Town, and, before I came to the Bank er with the Bill, ( which was for about 1100 L. Sterl. ) he was apprifed how I had ferved the Deputy-governor, and, upon prefenting it, accepted it to be paid in feven Days; but withal defired, that I would conftantly keep two European Seamen at his Door, with Arms, and, as Money came in, they were to receive one Bag, and the King's People ano ther, till the Sum lliould be completed: And accordingly in feven Days I got every Peny, and fent the Governor word, that I wanted to wait on him, in order to take my Leave. He returned me Anfwer, that I ihould be ve ry welcome; and accordingly I went, and he received me very civilly; and, all the while I ftaid, he pafled Jokes on his Deputy about the Fright I had put him into. The King's Cuftoms are very eafy, being but 3 fer Cent, from Europeans^ and 5* on Gen* tiles ; and the Cuftom-houle as eafy, for they only defire to fee the Mullers of Goods, and' the Quantity of Goods in each Parcel or Bale, and lb caufe fome, that they choofe, to be opened 5 and if they find the Quantity and Qualityvf the Eaft Indies. 47 Quality agree with the Invoice given in, the Remainder of the Cargo is carried directly from the Landing-place, to the Ware-hou- fes, without more Trouble and, after Sale, they receive an Account from the Seller, and rate the Cultoms accordingly. They are very ignorant in Hiftory and natural Philofophy; for they tell, that Alex ander i\\z Great was Mahomet's General, tho' they lived about 900 \ ears dillant from one another; and that, having a Mind to tran- fport his Army over the Mouth of the Red Sea, from Babelmandel to Zeyla, in order to conquer Ethiofia, he went about building a Bridge there; and, there being feven Wands in thefe Streights, called the Seven Stones, he placed them there for a Foundation to build on: And they are of Opinion, that the World is fupported on the Horns of a great Bull, who fometimes lliakes his Head, which they allign to be theCaufe of Earthquakes, which frequently are felt there. T here are Abundance of Beggars in cha, and in moll other Towns in Arabia^ who brag of the Sandity and Verity of their Religion; and, for Proof, when they pafs in the Streets, they are always bawling out, that there is but one God, and Mahomet his Pro phet and beft beloved Servant; and, carry ing a Piece of Iron like the Tooth of an Har row, in their right Hand, they ftrikeitwith great Force into the Cavity of the Eye, and yet the Eye is not blemiihed, nor the Eye lids, or Skia about the Eye, feem to be hurt; and48 A new Account and they often let the Iron hang down, as if the Point was faftned to the Corner of the Eye next the Nofe. As for mad People of either Sex, they venerate them, believing them to be infpired^ or aduated by a prophe- tick Spirit. Their Religion is Mahometifm, and are fuperflitioufly rigid in their Way, but abomi nable Hypocrites ; for, in their Promifes* which they feldom keep, with lifted up Eyes, they call on God to be Witnefs to their Sin cerity : But in no Part of the World is Jufticc bought and fold more publickly than here; and the Judge, who generally is the Governor of the Place, whilft he is palling unjuft Sen tences, looks as grave as an old Cat, declaim ing againft Partiality. In Anno 1716. I law Juftice executed on a notorious Criminal, guilty of no lefs thai! Robbery and Murden A poor Peafant had raifed a Stock of 500 Dollars, amongft his Friends and Neighbours, and was on his Way to Mocha, to lay it out in Merchandize pro per for the Parts he lived in. A Villain, who' knew of his Journey, and the Stock he car ried, way-laid him, and cut his Throat from Ear to Ear, and then {tabbed him in the Bread with his Dagger, and fo pofleft the Money, and went off with it. Some PaiTen- gers, coming that Way foon after, found the mangled Corps, not quite cold, went and informed the Neighbourhood of the Trage dy. On Information, they went and viewed the Carcafe, and knew it. They gave the Accountof the Eaft Indies.

Some Months after, one of tl&gt;e Relations being at Mocha, chanced to fee his dead Kinfman s Ring on the Murderer's Finger, iind challenged it; for it is the Cuflomofall the ealrern Countries, Both the Mahometans In ij 1:0 wear They wear no Gold Rings, but Silver among the Mahome- twis, and the Gent Hes commonly wear Gold.

And accordingly, with a Guard of about 5*00 Horfe and Foot Soldiers, he was carried without the City, with his Hands tied be hind him; and, about 200 Yards ixov&amp;Sheek Seddley\ Gate, he was delivered to the Dc- fund's Relations, who firft gave him a deep Stab under the left Pap, and one of the Relati ons {landing behind, pulled back his Head, while another cut his Throat from Ear to Ear, and fo left him with all their Speed. For af- foon as the Mob faw him killed, they aflaul- ted the Executioners with Stones and Brick bats fo furiouily, that the Guards had much ado to fave them from being murdered ; for there is a Paflage in the Alcoran, importing^ that- whoever fpilt a Reliever's Blood, is ac- curfed, and ought to be ftoned to Death. The Soldiery of Mocha, are very infolent and licentious; for, in the Months of May i 'jnne and July, the Air being fired with Heat, and the greateft Concourfe of Stran gers come to Town, either about Traffick, or getting Paflage by Sea to foreign Coun tries, and about that Time Calh is plentieft in I own, then thole undifciplined Cowards feldom fail to fet Fire to fome Huts that the |abouring People live in, and they being built of a few Spars, covered with the Bran chesof the Eaft Indies. 51 dies and Leaves of Date Trees, which are very combullible Materials, the Flame foon grows fierce and violent, and very often pe netrates thro' the Doors and Windows of Merchants Houfes, tho'built of Brick. And, in the Conllernation, when People are intent on faving what they can, by removing their Goods from their burning Houfes to the Streets, thofeVarlets plunder publicldy there with Impunity; and, altho' thofe Villains are deteded in letting Fire to Houfes and plun dering,' and Complaints made of them to the Governor, thofe Grievances are fo far, from being redreifed, that I have known a Com- plainer well baftonaded , for deteding . the Rogues. When I traded there, I always kept a Part of my Ship's Company alhore for a Guard, and I acquainted the Governor, that if any Perfon came thro' our Street in the Night with Fire in their Hands, as they, of ten did thro' feveral other Streets r where Merchants kept their Ware-houfes, I would order my Men to lire on fuch Fire-carriers/ which kept me pretty fecure from them.

H E eaftmoft Town of Note in the Im- maum of Mochas Dominions on the Sea-coaft, is Aden, built by the Turks, in the fourteenth Century, as has been hinted be fore. It is built on the Eaft Side of a barren Illand, and has notrelh Water but what the Rains afford them, which they keep in Ci- fterns. The Turks had great Defigns when they built it, for they thought of driving the Tortugueze out of their Settlements in and to have polleft them themfelves. Accor dingly about the Middle of the ftxteenth Century, they made an Expedition into In dia, againft the Tortugueze, but were unfuc- ccfsful, and fo have never attempted fince to fettle in India. It continued many Years af ter the Stapple Port for the Red Sea Com merce, but the Charges of keeping it, fo far from the Turkijh Dominions, made them leave it to the Immaum, as was already obferved, and he removed the Trade to Mocha. ^ I t has a good Road for Shipping in the Wefterly Monfoons, and a pretty good Mould, or Bafon, for the Eafterly, clofe to the Town, D 3 and5^ A new Account and the Road is not Half Gun-fliot from it. It has been well fortified, being naturally ftroiig in its Situation; but the Badows, or wild Arabs, who inhabit about the Sea-coaft of Arabia petrea, have feveral Times taken, and plundred it, fmce it fell into the Imma- a/w's Bands/ The Country adjacent produ ces Barley, Wheat and Legumen, and Store of Fruits and Roots, Camels, AlTes, Mules an4 Horfes, all very finely fhaped and mettle- fom ; but Money being pretty plenty in that Part of the Country, their Horles are very dear, for 50 or 60 L. Stcrl. is reckoned but * fmall Price for one. They have alfo Plen ty of Sheep, with large broad Tails, that reiu:h almoft to the Ground, and their Goats are the fineft, both for Beauty and Tafte, that e- ver I favv. And they have Poultry and G/zi- fiea Hens in Abundance. And the Sea affords Variety of good Fifti. The Immaums, Domi nions reach about 1,0 Leagues to the Eallward of Aden^ along the Sea^coaft ; but there are tio Places of Trade till we come to Cajjin, that lies almoft under the Meridi an of Cape Guardafoy, and under the prodi gious high Mountains of Megiddo* on the Coaft of Arabia. I have feen thole Moun tains, in a clear Day, above 40 Leagues off. ; T h e Religion of CaJJin is Mahometan^ and the civil Government 'Democracy.

And the Tragi-comedy ends in Feafting; The Product of the Country (befides the common Roots, and Fruits and Animals) is Myrrh and OLibamm or Frankincenfe, which they barter for coarfe Calicoes from India; but they have no great Commerce with Strangers. Nor has 'IJoffarz.ny better Trade, but is more noted for Barbarity to thofe they can circumvene. I knew an Englijh Ship in Anno 1705-. that called there for frelh Water, and the Natives came flocking on board with animal Provilions to fell or barter. They found the £'^/i/^fupinely negligent, and, be ing but fix or feven in Number, they mixt with them, and fuddenly (tabbed them all; but did no Harm to the Indian Seamen and Merchants, who were about 40 in Number. They took every Thing out of the Ship, and then burnt her. Curia Muria is another Port on that Shore, but of fmall Account, It is in the Middle of feven Iflands, each having a very high Mountain, which makes them confpicu- ous from the Sea. There are none that fre quent it but Trankies, that navigate from the (julf of i Perfia\.o the Red Sea^ who call there tor frefli W ater and Recruits of Provifion. The Inhabitants, along all that Coaft 3 are Bar* dows y who wear no Clothes above the Na- Yel, Their Hair grows long, which they D 4 plat.5^5 A new Account plat, and wreathe about their Heads. The next remarkable Place is Maceira, a barren uninhabited Ifland, lying about 5* Leagues from the Continent, and within 10 Leagues of Cape Raffelgat. It has dangerous Sholes lying on its W eft End, which reach above 30 Leagues along the Shore to the Wert ward, and fo far in the Sea, that the Land (tho' pretty high) cannot be feen, before the un- skilful^ or unwary Pilot feels the Rocks with his Ship's Keel. The Inhabitants on the main Continent, feem to be Sorcerers; for about the Year 1684. a Ship from London, called the Merchants 'Delight, Czytzm Edward Say Supercargo, this Ship unfortunately run a- fliore on the IHand in the Night, being very dark, notwithflanding they kept their deep Sea Lead going every Half Hour; yet they were fo lucky as to run her faft a-ground be tween two Rocks very clofe to the Shore, In a few Minutes the Ship was full of Water, but, being dry on the upper Decks, the People kept on them till Day-light, and then they difcovered about 4 or 500 wild Arabs, with fome Tents pitched at a little Diltance from them. The Arabs, by Signs, fhewed themfelves ready to aflift the diftrefled Englljh, and be ing excellent Swimmers, fwam to. the Ship, and Drought the End ofa Rope afliore. There was one on board, whom I was afterwards Well acquainted with, who, before that, had lailed fome Years in India, and had learned $nc Indujian Language, and fome Arabick; heof the Eaft Indies. h pJ^h^ r u n - r , n J ter P retcr - The y bid the En&amp;Jh hoift their Boats out, and come afhore without Fear, which they accordingly did, with their Arms.

They anfwered, that about eight Days before the Ship was loft, a Fakee, who is an ecclefiaftick Officer in their Church, prophefied, that near fuch a Time, a Ship would be loft there, and preffed them to go to the Aftiftance of the (hip-wrack'd People, who would be glad to come under Contraft with them, to have one Half of what was gotten out of the Wrack ; and conjured his Auditory to perform their Part faithfully, which accordingly they did; tho' at other Times the Endows are perfidious, treach erous and cruel. Cape Raffel^at lies about 16 Leagues to the Laftward 01 Maceira, and the Sea-lhore is clear of Danger ; and juft within the Cape, to the Northward, is a Village called Teywee, which ftands on the Side of a fmall River, near the Sea} but is beft known by a little Mountain (clofe by it) lhaped like an high- crown'd Hat. And about 16 Leagues far ther to the Northweftward, is Curiat, a large V illage in a Valley clofe to the Sea. To the Northward of it is a very high large Moun tain, whofe Foot is wafht by the Sea, and there are 40 Fathoms within 200 Paces of it. It niay be feen above 40 Leagues from the Sea. There are neither Trees nor Grafs to be feen along the Sea-coaft, but at Cur tat; and yet the Country has Plenty of Cattle, greatof the Eaft Indies. 59 ^reat and fmall, with Variety of Fruits and Roots from the Vallies, and Filh from the Sea. Their Wells are dug in the Vallies ve ry deep before they come to Springs, but the Water is very good. CHAP. VII. Treats of the Kingdom and City of Muskat, and of their religious and civil Cnftoms ; ivith fome hifiorical Account of their TVars and O economy. And a little Account of the Sea-coaft of Arabia deferta, as far as Baf- fora. SKAT lies about Leagues to the North-wellward of Curiat, and is the Mart Town of Arabia petrea. It is built on the Bottom of a fmall Bay, that almofl has the Shape of anHorfe Shoe, It was built and fortified by the Tortugueze, in the fif teenth Century, but taken from them about the Year 1650. The King of that Province ( for tho' there be many Kings in Arabia, yet none afTumes the Title of King of Arabia) having War at that Time with ^ 'Perfians^ had raifed an Army of 40000 Men to infult the Sea-coaft of Terfia ; and had provided a fufficient Number of fmall VeiTels, called Trankies, for their Tranfports His Army lay at a little Diftance from Muskat, and his Fleet at Mutt era, a fmall Bay about a Mile from the Entrance of Muskat Harbour. The F . • Vmcrdo A new Account King fent a civil Mellage to the Tortugueze Governor, defiring the Liberty of his Mar kets to buy Provilions. T he infolent Governor, thinking him- felf fafe within a walled Town, with many fmall Forts to annoy any Enemy that could come to attack the Walls of the Town, in- ftead of returning a civil Anfwer to the King's Rcqueft, fent a Piece of Pork wrapt up in Paper, as a Prefent to the King, and bid the Meflenger tell him, that if he wanted fuch Provifions, he could furnifh him. The Mef- fenger, not knowing what was in the Paper, carried it to his Mafter, with the rude Anfw 7 er. Now Pork being forbidden the Mahometans as well as Jews, they hold it in Abomination, and consequently it aggravated the dcflgned Affront. The King was much furprized at the Governor's ill Manners, but diffembled his Refentment, in Expeda- tion to ^nd a proper Time at his Return from his Terjian Expedition, to correft the Go vernor^ Infolence, or revenge the Affront put on him: But the whole Army being enra ged at the Affront, breathed nothing but pre fent Revenge. And the Queen, who was of the «5V/^Extra£tion, who are a Tribe or Family de- fcended from Mahomet, by his Daugh ter and Alii his Apoftle, being of a mafculine fiery Temper, reproached the King for not refenting fo grofs an Affront, fwore by her Anceftor the Prophet, that Ihe would never flir out of the Tent Hie then fat in, till Mnf- kat was taken from the Tortugueze. All the Armyof the Eaft Indies 6t Army applauded the Queen, and threatned to mutiny, if they were not forthwith led by their Officers to the Scalade of the City Walls. And at lait the King finding that no Perfwafions could cool their Fury, tho' the Day was far fpent, ordered them to be led on. The Tortugueze flank'd them, from their Forts on the Mountains, with Plenty of great and imall Shot; but the Arabs never looked back, nor minded the great Numbers of their dead Companions, but mounted the Walls over the Carcafes of their llain. About Sun-fet they drove the ^Portugueze from two of the City Gates, and purfued their Enemy fo hard, that not one efcaped, tho' they fled in great Hafle towards the great Fort, where the Governor flaid. That Fort is built on a Rock almoft furrounded by the Sea, and has no Way to get up to it, but by a Stair-cafe hewn out of the Rock, above 50 Yards high, and not above two or three Perfons can a- fcend a-breaft. The Arabs thought it im- pradicable to attack it, fo made aBlocade of it. In the Attack of the Town, xhz Arabs loft between 4 and 5*000 of the bed of their Forces; and the 'Portugueze, in their Forts, were reduced to 60 or 70. Thofe in the fmall Forts were obliged foon to furrender for W ant of Ammunition and Provifions; and all were put to the Sword, except thofe, who, to fave their Lives, promifed to be cir- cumcifcd, and, abjure the Chrifiian Religion. Thofe in the great Fort held out about fix Months, under great Want and Fatigues; and all6t A new Account all Hopes of Relief being cut off, they refol- ved on a Surrender, on which Motion, the imprudent Governor, who was the fole Caufe of their Calamity, leapt down a Precipice in- to the Sea, where the Water being very Ihal- low, he was daftit to Pieces on the Rocks. The little Garifon would fain have come to a Capitulation, but the Arabs would grant them no Terms, but that they muft yield, or be flarved ; and tho' the Terms were hard, yet they thought bell to furrender, and all were put to the Sword, except a few who embraced Mahomett/m, which in all were eighteen Perfons. And this Relation I had from a very old Renagado, who was at the •Tragedy, being then a Soldier, who reck oned himfelf about 100 Years old, and, by his Afpeft, could not be much lefe. The City of Muskat is very Itrong, both by Nature and Art; but the Buildings very mean, as mofl Fabricks are under the Oeco- nomy of a People who abominate Luxury and Pride, as the Muskat Arabs do. . The Cathedral built by the Tortugueze, ilill re tains fome Marks of its ancient Grandeur, and is now converted into a Palace for the King, when he refides there, which is gene rally a Month or two yearly. The Wall of the Town that faces the Harbour, has a Bat tery of large Cannon, about 60 in Number, and there are 8 or 10 fmall Forts built on the adjacent Rocks or Mountains, which guard a-' the Avenues to the Town, both by Sea and Land ; afteWrerfjweHftC-ue emitted to comeof the Eaft Indies. 6$ come in or go out of the Harbour between Sun-fet and Rifing. T h e Pirates that infefted the Indian Seas at the latter End of the lixteenth Century, made a Breach between the Englijh and them. The Pirates having made Prize of one of their Ships, they retaliated on the Englijb private Shipping: They feized Captain Mar- rices s little Ship, and detained him and all his Crew as Slaves, and would never ranfom them. In Anno 1705-. they took Captain vel in a rich Ship from Bengal, bound to Terfia ; but that might be attributed to Pulil- lanimity, in not offering to make a Defence. They put their Slaves to no Manner of Labour, and allow them a Soldier's Pay for Subfiitence ; and what they can earn other- wife by Induftry, is wholly their own. There are neither Trees, Shrubs nor Grafs to be feen on the Sea-coaft from C«ri- at to Muskaty and but a few Date Trees in a Valley at the Back of the Town, and yet there is not the leafl Want of them felt in the City; and it has as good Markets for Wheat, Barley and Legumen, and for excellent Fruits, Roots and Herbage, and good Cattle, both great and fmall, as any where in India, where the Soil is moft luxurious. And the Sea fur- nifties them with Plenty and Variety of ex cellent Filh. Their Cattle locJk to be very lean, but when killed, they are very fat and good, affording a great Deal of Tallow. They are not well Hocked with Fowl, but thofe they have, are very good, From6\ A nm Account From May to September the Heats are excellive in the Town, fo that none appear on the Streets, from 10 in the Morning till 3 or 4 after Noon. Their Bazaars or Mar kets are all covered with Date Tree Leaves, fpread on Beams of the fame Tree, that reach from Houfe to Houfe-top ; and the Houfes being all flat on their Tops, terrafTed with Clay and Straw mixt, in the aforefaid Months every Body lodges on them in the Nights; for below Stairs they cannot fleep for Heat, and the Nights afford plentiful Dews, that fometimes weet them thro' their thick Cotton Quilts ; and thefe Dews are reckoned very falubrious. The Reafon of fo intenfe Heats proceeds from the Nearnefs of the Sun in thofe Months, who fends his Beams almoft perpendicularly down on the Sides of the Mountains,which be ing all naked, and nothing but an hard black Rock appearing, the Sun heats them to fuch a Degree, that between icand n in the Fore noon, I have feen the Slaves roll Filh on them. And the Horfes and Cattle, who are accuitomed to that Food, come daily, of their own Accord, to be ferved their Allowance, and when they have breakfafled, retire again to Shades built for them; and yet their Beef and Mutton, that are partly nourilhed by that Sort of Food, have not the leail Savour of F ifh. And the Reafon why Filhes are fo plen tiful and cheap in the Markets, is by the ea- fy and odd Way they have in catching them, or rather conjuring ot them ; for I have feenof the Eaft Indies. &lt;5y a Man and two Boys catch a Tun Weight in an Hour or two. The Man ftands on a Kock, where the Sea is pretty deep near itj and calls Tall, tally for a Minute or two, and the Hlh come fwarming about the Rock, i he two Boys, in a little Boat, (hut them in with a Net about 20 or 30 Yards long, and 3 or 4 deep, and, drawing the Net near the Kock, keep all in; and, when People come tor Hfh, he asks them what Sorts they want, and puts an Hoop-net, fixed to the End of a 1 oJe, into the Water, and ferves every Bo dy with what Kind they ask for; and when ne has done, he hales out his Net, and »ives the reft their Liberty. T he 1 R eftablillicd Religion is Mahometan^ of the becl of Alii. 1 hey hinder no Body, of what Perfwafion foever, to go into their Mofques, even in Time of divine Service. And their Molahs or Priefts often preach themfelves into violent Paffions, efpecially if the Subject of their Sermon be about the Verity of their Religion; and then they'll challenge the Priefts of any other Religion whatever, to confirm theirs with as good E- yidences as they can; for, being well verfed m L.egerdemain Tricks,- (which all we Chri- Jhans, except one Set of our Priefts, are ig norant of) they 11 take live Coals out of the 11c, and leem to eat them, with as good an Appetite as a School-boy can eat a Bereamy Pear; which Trick the poor deluded Ail- ditory takes for a Miracle, to confirm the ^ndity of their Religion. ^ ^ T he66 A new Account The King keeps his Court generally at Nazawa or Reyflock, two Towns four or five Days Journey from Muskat within Land, He has no fplendid Equippage, and his Garb very plain, and no finer than an ordinary Soldier's is. He has about 100 of his own Slaves armed with Matchlocks and Ihort broad Swords, for his Guard, who always attend on him. He, nor his Subjects ufe no Tables, but plain Mats fpread on the Ground, ferve for Table and Chairs. Their Viands are a Difh of Rice, either plain, or made in Pillaw, and a Dilh or two more of flew'd or fryed Flefli, Filh or Fowl, placed near the Difli of Rice: And he, with his Table Com panions, fit on the fame Mat, with their Buttocks on their Heels, and, in that Po- llure, they feed very plentifully. Their right Hand ferves them for Spoon, Knife and Fork, except when they eat Broth or Milk, and then they have large wooden Spoons. Their ufual Drink is Water, or fowre Milk, and in hot Weather Sherbets. They make no great Difference about Table Guefts; for the King and a common Soldier, the Mafter and Slave, fit promifcu- oufly, and dip in the fame Difli: But Wo men never eat in Company with Men. The Mens Apparel is a Pair of Breeches down to their Ancles, with a loofe Veil on their Backs, with very large Sleeves, and the Body of the Veil girded about their Bodies with a Safli, and a large Turband carelefly wreath 'd about their Heads, and a Poniard, or a ihort t broadof the Eaft Indies. %y broad Sword (luck into their Girdle perpen dicularly ; their Shoes clumlily made, and very ]ow and lliff at the Quarter-heels; ,and thils a Gentleman is equipped; bilt in cold Weather they ufe Camelins, a fort of loole Coat, without Sleeves, made ofCamels Wooli: Their Women wear Breeches to their Heels* of finer Stuffs, and better Colours than the Men. The Body of the Veft made for their Ufe, is flrait, but fliort wafted, and gathered above the Navel in Plats, which makes the lower Part look like a Petticoat. Their Shoes are fliap'd like the Mens, flat and broad. • T he Reafon why their Shoes are made fo, is for their eafier Hipping off or on, when they enter, or come out of a Room, that they may not dirty the Carpets or Mats where with the Rooms are fpread, which ferve them for Beds in cold Weather. And, except fome large round Pillows of broad Cloth or Velvet, iluft with Cotton, for the Eafe of thofe who fit on the Carpets or Mats, to lean upon as they fit crofs-legg'd, there is no other Furniture in a Room. . ? O ver all the three Arahias^ theirCuftom in treating Strangers or Friends, is the fame; for affoon as every one is feated, a Servant brings a Pot of Coffee, and ferves it about in fmall Cups, that contain not a Quarter of a Gill; but affoon as one Cup is out, they fill again, and perhaps a third Time: Then a Pipe of Tobacco is prefented, their Pipes differing much from ours in Europe, in Shape 3nd Magnitude; which Service laiis till near t Ex ths(58 A new Account the Time of breaking up Company, when comes in a little Pot of hot burning Coals, on which they throw fome Chips of Agala- wood, or fome Powder of Benjoin, Myrrh or Frankincenfe, which produce a thick Smoke, that incenfes or perfumes the whole Room. And, as I obferved before, it is the Cuftom of wearing very great Sleeves to their Garments. They open their Sleeves as wide as they can, and hold them over the Smoke, which perfumes their Arms, Shoul ders, Neck and Beard. And the lail: Courfe is fome Rofe-w T ater to befprinkle the Compa ny, which is the Signal to be gone every one about their Bulinefs ; fo, without any Forms of Ceremony, every one walks off. The Produds of Arabia petrea. for Ex portation, are but few, as Horfes, Dates, fine Brimftone, fome Coffee, but not fo good as at Mocha-, fome Ruinofs, which is the Root of a fmall Shrub, that dies Crimfon, and fome Pearl. Their Manufadure is fome coarfe Cotton Linen and Camelins, which they confume moft in their own Country; but the Badows need none, fince they wear none. The Arabs wear no Pearl or Gold; but the Women of Diitindion wear Pearl of a fmall Pi ice, tho' I faw one there as big as a large Hazel-nut, exaftly round, and of a fine Water. It was valued atioco Tomans, which is above 3000 L. Sterl. I have fome- times gone in a Boat to fee them dive for Pearl, and have bought fome Pearl Oyflers of them 7 but the Divers are Cheats, putting the Oyftersof the Eaft Indies. 6() Oyllers in the Sun, which makes them gape, and then the Rogues rummage them, and lliake out the Pearl; and, after they are rob bed of their Treafure, they put them into Water again, and they elofe. I bought at Times above icq Oyfters, and got nothing; they coll me but feven Pence half Peny a Piece. At laft I found one that had an Ex- crefcence growing to the Shell on the Infide, which I carefully took off; and, at Carwar in India, I fold it for 9 L, Sterl. The \\ omen in this Country have fome peculiar Privileges beyond the Men; for if one complain that a Man has offered Violence to her Perfon, without further Proof than her Word gf Honour, he is punifhed with 100 Ballinadoes on the Soles of the Feet, or put into a Dungeon under Ground, which has only an Hole at the Top, big enough to receive a Man; and when he is in, there is a Stone put over the Hole, too big to be removed by a fingle Perfon, and there he mult Hay three Days, and as many Nights, without Meat or Water, or Room to ly at his Length. And if a Wife complain of her Husband for Unkindnefs in any Kind, parti cularly of due Benevolence, as by Law ella- blilhed in the JewiJh and Mahometan Chur ches, the Husband mult undergo the Punilh- ment of the Dungeon. Bur if a Lady tref- pafTes, and her Spoufe deteft her Crime, he has the Law in his own Hand, and may cha- Itife her with the Whip feverely; but muft not touch her Life, on Pain of Death, E 3 T H 5:7° A nm Account The Muskat Arabs are remarkable for their Humility and Urbanity. I had one In- fiance of their Civility. As I was one Morn ing walking the Streets, I met accidentally the Governor of the City, by them called the JVaaly^ and, according to my Duty, I went into the Door of a Shop, to let him and his Guards have the Street, which generally are narrow ; but he obferving, by my Complexi on and Garb, that I was a Stranger, made his Guard go on one Side, and beck'ned me to come forward, and flood till I pall by him. And for an Inilance of their cool Temper, in hearing Debates and redifying Millakes between Parties difagreeing about Commerce: The before mentioned Interpreter at Macei- ra, was Commander of a Ship from India, and had freighted her to Muskat. The Freighter, who was a Mahometan, delayed paying the Freight, long after it was due by the Tenor of the Charter-party; upon which he being in Paffion with the Freighter for his continued Delays, went to the JVaaly to complain. ' He obferving by the Gentleman's Countenance, that his Mind was difcompo- fed, anfwered him, that being at that Time very bufy about fome of the King's Affairs, he had not Time to fend for his Freighter, but defired that he would come fome other Time, and he would hear him, and order the Payment. ' The Delays flill continuing, the Captain went again in an angry Mood to make his Complaint, but was ftill put offwith gentle Excufes: But at lafl addrefling the JVaalyof the Eaft Indies. yr IVaaly with Coolnefs, he was defired to fit down, and he would fend for the Freighter, which accordingly he did; and, on his Ap pearance, the IVaaly askt him why he did pot comply with his Contract, as was ilipula- ted by Charter-party; and his Excufes being thought inlufficient, he was ordered to make Payment forthwith, or go to Prifon; but the Freighter chofe rather to bring the Money, and end the Difpute. The Captain askt the Waaly why he did not do him Jullice fooner, who received for Anfwer, that it was his own Fault, for coming drunk to make Com plaint. The Captain protefted that he had not been drunk in many Years; but the Waa- ly replied, that he faw him drunk with Paf- lion, which was the moll dangerous Sort of Drunkennefs. The Countries to the Southward of Muf- kat, as far as CuriaMuria, are under the Do minions of Muskat, and the Sheeks or Prin ces are their Tributaries. The Land is moun tainous; but the Plains and V allies very fer- til and well watered, and confequently well peopled. And, to the Northward of Muskat, the fame Chain of rocky Mountains continue as high as Zoar^ above Cape Mufenden, which Cape and Cape Jaques begin the Gulf of c FerJia, on the Arabian Side. About Zoar begins the Defert, that runs as far northerly as Aleppo. The Monntains near the Sea, are fandy, and the Vallies and Plains fleril, and ill inhabited, and as ill watered. A bout tn a new Account A bout the Year i6xo. Terfia was in a flourifliing Condition, and was a Terror to all its Neighbours. Shaw Tamas^ Son to the famous Shaw Ahafs, was then King, andbe-r ing of a martial Difpofition, had a Defign to annex all x \\ q ,Arabian Coatt oppofite to 'Ter- fla^ to his own Dominions, and accordingly tranfported from Cong^ a City of his own that lies on the Sea-fhore, an Army of 35' 01*40000 Men to conquer it. The Army met with no Oppofition in landing, and they foon over ran the Country wherever they went; but they had not been long in Purfuit of their Conqueft, till Provifions began to be fcarce in the Army, which, with the Scarcitv of frefr Water, and the intolerable Heats, both of Sun and Winds, brought a Contagion on the TerfianS) that killed the better Half of diem, and obliged what was left to return back to Terfia by Shipping, as they had come from it. Those barren Coalls are needlefly fecu-. red by fandy Banks, that run 10 or 12, Lea gues off from the Shore, which would make Navigation impracticable, if it fliould meet with Encouragement; but the two Iflands of Bareeny lying in the Latitude of 29 De grees 30 Minutes, almoft in the Bottom of the vjulf, and belonging to the Crown ol'Perfiay have the belt Pearl Fifhing in the World. A bout the Beginning of this Century, the ±Auskat Arabs took Poire/lion of Bareen I- llands; but the honefl Pearl Filhers deferred it whilft the Arabs kept PolFeffion,^ who . - findingof the Eaft Indies: ^ finding that their new Settlement could not defray the Charge of keeping, without the Pearl Fiftiers, they left it; and the Fifhers, who are moftly Arabs, returned to their In- duftry, and continue the Fifliery. The great Turk gives Laws to all the Countries that ly between the River Euphra tes and Ethiopia ; but there arc many Sheeks Who inhabit thofe Deferts, that make but fmall Account of him or his Orders, becaufe the Sterility of their Country makes them fe- cure from great Armies coming amongft them, and a fmall one dares not venture amongft them as Enemies. They being naturally Thieves, rob Friend or Foe, or one another; fo that few People of Subltance have any Commerce with them. There are no Towns of Note between Muskat and Baffora, but Zoar, and but very few inconfiderable Villages; but there are two or three pretty convenient Harbours for Shipping. The fouthermoft is about 6 Leagues to the Southward of Cape Mofen- den, called Courforcaun. It is almoft like 71/#/^ kat Harbour, but fomewhat bigger, and has excellent frelh Water in deep Wells, about a Quarter of a Mile from the Landing-place. The Village contains about twenty little Hour fes; yet there are pretty good Refrelhments to be had there. Cape Mofenden is of itfelf but a good Number of/mail high Iflands ly ing near one another, but they appear like a Promontory on Terra firma. And up to the Weftward of the.Cape there is another Har-74 A new Account hour, whofe Name I have forgot; but there are good frefli Water and animal Provifions to be had there. And now having defcribed Muskat and its Territories as well as I can, I'll make one Obfervation more, and proceed on my Travels. Ever fince the Tortugueze left Muskat to the Arabs, there has been a continual War; but in the main the Arabs have been the Gainers, yet they have been obliged to build and buy Ships of Force to confront the Tortugueze at Sea, and to keep their Coaits free from their Infults. Their Fleets have often met, and had fome Engagements, but few Ships have been taken or funk on either oide; but Merchant Ships of both Sides have been taken. The Tortugueze ufe their Cap tives with great Severity, making them la bour hard, and inure them to the Difci- pline of the Whip ; but the Arabs ufe theirs with very much Humanity, only making them Prifoners at large, without putting them to hard Labour, and allow them as much Diet Money as their own Soldiers receive, and that is duly paid them twice a Month. And if any of the 'Portugueze are Artificers or Mechanicks, they may freely work at their Trade, to earn Money to redeem themfelves. In Anno 171$. the Arabian Fleet conlilled of one Ship of 74 Guns, two of 60, one of 50, and 18 fmall Ships from 31 to ix Guns each, and fome Trankies or rowing VelTels from 4 to 8 Guns each, with which Sea Forces they keep all the Sea-coalts in Aw, from CapeCb- mermof the Eaft Indies. *75 Merin to the Red Sea. They have often made Defcents on theColonies on the Coall of India, dellroying their Milages and Farms, but fpare the Churches, for better Reafons than we can give for plundring them. They kill none in cold Blood, but ufe their Captives courteouily. In Anno 1695'. they quarrelled with the Carnatkk Rajah, a po tent Prince by Land; yet they came with their Fleet, and plundred and burned the Towns of Earfalore and Mangulore, two of the bed and richeft Towns on that Coalt. And now I leap from Muskat to CHAP. vm. Gives an Account of Baflbra City, and that Tart of Arabia deferta; with Remarks on its Government and Commerce, and fome Occurrences, both ancient and modern, that have happened to it; with fome Account of the famous River of Euphrates. T3^ S O RA is the eaftmoft City or Town Jfj m t ^ e Turkijh Dominions, ftanding a- bout two Miles from the famous Euphrates, and has a fmall Rivulet that waflies its Walls on the Weft Side, and difcharges its Waters into the Euphrates. This City Hands about 30 Leagues from the Sea, and it is alledged, was built by the Emperor Trajan, and had the Honour to be the Birth-place of another Roman Emperor, T hi lip firnamed the Ara-76 A new b 'tan: But at firft it was built along the Side of the River, and the Vcfiigia of its ancient Walls are ftill to be feen from the aforefaid Rivulet, a League down the Banks of Eu^ fhrates, which difembogues her Waters, by four or five Mouths, into the Gulfof k P^r/^; but none navigable for Ships of Burden, but that Chanel that leads to Bajfora. At the Ci ty it is a lliort Mile over at high Water, and it keeps about the fame Breadth to the very Mouth of it. T he River abounds in Filli, but none good, except a fmall Shad about the Bignefs of an Herring. And there is great Plenty of wild Fowl, fuch as Swans, Geefe, Duck, Teal, Wigeon and Curlews; and the Fields have Plenty of Partridge of feveral Kinds, Plover, Snipes, Doves, Pigeons and large Larks, whofe Flefli is very favoury, and their wild Notes grateful to the Ear. They have alfo Birds of Prey, as Eagles, many Sorts and Sizes of Hawks, and Kites, Crows black and white, and it is obfervable, that the black keep the Arabian Side of the River, and the white the C Perfian, and if any prefume to interlope into anothers Province, they raife the 'Tojfe, and drive them back to their own Territo ries. T here is great Plenty of fmall Tortois in the River; but none cat them, becaufe they are forbidden in the Levitical Law, to which the Mahometans adhere much in Point of eating. Fhey have alfo many Species of wild Beafts. Wild Swine are very numerous, . - ' andof the Eaft Indies. and their Flefli is very fweet and juicy, but no Fat to be feen about them. And the Pea- fants come often to Town to invire Cbrifti* ans to kill them ; for they make fad Havock of their Corn and Roots. And if a Chrifiian kills any, they'll bring them to their Houfes on Affes or Mules, for a very fmall Reward, notwithftanding there is a pofitive Command in the Alcoran^ that forbids them to touch Swine^ Flefh. They have Plenty of black Cattle, wild and tame, and good Milk; but they make but fcurvy Cheefe of it, and no Butter, be- caufe they make the Fat of their Sheeps Tails ferve in their Kitchens inflead of But ter ; and they keep no Tea-tables for the Confumption of frefli Butter. And Coffee, which is much in Ufe, is the conftant Compa nion of a Pipe of Tobacco, which is taken by the Ladies as well as Gentlemen. In the Defert, which is very near the Town, there are wild Camels, Hqrfes, AlFes, Goats, Lions 4 Leopards, Panthers and Foxes, which they hunt on Horfe-back, with Sword and Lance, and on Foot with Fowling-pieces. They have Plenty of delicious Fruits, as Pomegra nates, Peaches, Apricocks, Quinces, Olives, Apples, Pears, Nedarines and Grapes that are as fweet as the Juice of the Suggar-cane, and their Spirits arefo w 7 eak, that they'll produce neither Wine nor Vinegar: But the moll plenty and ufeful of all their Fruits, are their Dates, which fupport and fuilain many Mil lions of People, who make them their daily Foody78 A new Account Food, and they are wonderfully nourifhed by them. Baffora exports yearly for foreign Countries, above icoooTunsof Dates, which employ Abundance of Seamen for their Expor tation, befides many more Poor in gathering and packing them in Mats made of the Leaves of the Date Tree, and like wife in drying them. I bought about 160 Pound Weight of wet Dates for x Jh. i d. Sterk and fometimes they are cheaper. The Ruines of the famous Babylon ly a- bout 200 Engltjb Miles up the River from BaJJbra\ and at Bagdat, which is ix Miles below it, the Ruines appear to be a Moun tain, and are the Habitation of wild Beails and Serpents. Whether Was built out of its Ruines, or no, I know 'not; but 'tis re ported, and generally believed that it was. It is now a prodigious large City, and the Seat of a Beglerbeg, who governs a very great Province. The Balhaws of Bajfora, Co wer a and Mufol (the ancient Nineveh) are fubordinate to him, and are able to bring 15 -0000 Men into the Field. Qomera ftands on the Banks of Euphrates, about 80 Miles above Baffora, and, by com mon Tradition, is the Place where holy Job dwelt. It abounds in all Things that Bajfbra produces, ^2;. Fruits, Roots, Herbs and Ani mals: Bendes, it is very fruitful in produc ing \&gt; heat, Rice, and Pulie of feveral Speci es. There is a Garilbn of 10000 Janifaries continually kept there, and 8 or 10 River Gallies, well furnifhed, to aw the circumja centof the Eaft Indies. y% cent Countries, who are apt to rebel. And Bajfora has 3000 Janifaries and 5- Gallies for the fame Account. The Balhaws of the Gal lies are not fubordinate to the Bafhaws of the Cities; but he of the Gallies has the Com mand of the circumjacent Countries, laying on of Taxes, and railing Sublidiesat hisPlea- fiire, as he of the Cities has Power to op- prefs the Citizens: And their Avarice and Severity often caufe Mutinies and Blood-fhed. One of thofe Mutinies happened at Bajfora, in Anno 17x1. for the Bafhaw of the City ha ving married a Lady out of the Grand Setg- 7tzor r s Seraglio, and that Monarch having fome Deference for her on Account of Con- fanguinity, her Husband was put into the Ba- ihaw's Ship to get Money tofupport his La dy's Extravagancy 5 and finding that fair honeft Ways would be a long While in raifingfuch Sums as he thought would be fufficient for that End, oppreil both City and Country to fill his Coffers. The poor oppreft Merchants, Mechanicks and Peafants plied him with Com plaints on his Soldiery, who, they thought, robbed them, fmce the Exa^ions were new. They gave in Remonftrances of their Griev ances, and petitioned for Redrefs; but the Perfons fent with thofe AddrefTes, had the Baftinado for their Impertinence. Upon this the diibrelTed City and Country made their Addrefs to the Bafhaw of the Gallies, who knew they had jull Caufe of Complaint. He Wrote to the Beglerbeg, and informed him of their Cafe and Condition^ and obtained a fe- vereSo A new Account vere R &amp;primand ; for he ot the City, inftead of Amendment, added Cruelties to Oppief- lion, and murdred many who would not, or could not pay what they were felled at, which unheard of Barbarities made above 50000 of the City and Country betake thcm- felves to Arms, and march out, with the Mufti or high Prieft at their Head; and he had a green Flag, which is Mahomet s Ban ner, before him, carried by a Prielt; and he and his Army encamped near the Bafhavv of theGallies his Houfe, which (lands about two Miles below the City, by the River Side; and the Balhaw of the Gallies joined them with 1000 Janifaries. The Muftiy accord*- ing to Cuftom, plied his fpiritual Artillery, and excommunicated theBafliaw of the City, and all that adhered to him. This Mutiny con tinued fome Days; but I heard of no Blood- Hied, and only opprobrious Language pad. But the Town began to feel Wantj for the Peafants would bring no Eatables to the Ci*- ty; but the Muftis Hod were plentifully fupplied. All Shops being ihut up, and all the Markets unprovided, made the Balliaw of the City begin to think what the End would be, if the Mutiny continued any long er ; fo he got fome Country Gentlemen, who were of neither Fa6Hon, to go to the Mufti zwdi the Balhaw of the Gallies, as Me diators ; and accordingly they went, and were handfomly received, and, in their O- ration on the prefent Pollure ot Affairs, made the Mufti and his Party incline to Peace, pro-of the Eaft Indies. 8 r providing that about a Do^en of Incendia« ries might be delivered to them, to receive condign Punifliment for their Faults. All the profcribed, but one, by the Interceflion of Friends, were pardoned ; but they would hear of no Peace till the other was made a Sacrifice to their juft Refentment; for this Villain would accolt a Merchant in the Street, and, after common Complimehts were, en ded, he would ask them what became of the Diamonds, or other Jewels, that they had lliewn him fuch a Time. The innocent Mer chant, who perhaps never had any Jewels, being furprifed at his Queflion, wotild deny that ever they had any fuch as he fpake of. Then the impudent Fellow would tell them plainly, that without they would bribe hint with a round Sdm, he would inform the Ba- fhaw, that he had feen fuch Quantities of rough Diamonds^ or other valuable Stones, in their PoiTeffion, and if they could not be found entred in the Cuftom-houfe Books, they muft expedl to fuffer what Puniihment the Bafhaw would pleafe to inflict for defrau ding the King of his Gulloms. Some out of Fear would comply, and give a Sum, others again llood on their Innocence, and would not give him Money; and they were fure to be informed againft, and brought before the Bafhaw, and, upon that Villain's Evidence^ were generally fined about double of what he askt of them ; fo that befides the great Sums that came into the Bafhaw's Coffers by that RafcaFs Ingenuity, he had accumulated t F twen^Si A new Accomi: twenty five Bags to himfelf, each Bag con taining ^oo Crowns, and all this, in the Space of three Years that he had been in Bajjora; for he came from Conjlantinofle one of the Bafhaw's Retinue, hardly worth art Afper t and at his Death fo much ready Cafli was found in his Houfe, which fell into his Ma iler the Balhaw's Hands; For after this Vil lain was culled out to be facrificed to the jufl Refentment of the People, and found that they would not be appeafed without ha ving his Life* he fell at his Mailer's Feet for Protedion. The cunning covetous Bafhaw bid him convey what Money he had to his Houfe, and he would take Care of it for the Ufe of his Wife and Children, and would fend him fecretly out of the Town, and get him fafely conducted to Comer a. He fwal- lowed that Bait, and delivered his ill-gotten Money to his Matter, who proteded him but one fmgle Day, and then told him, that the People's Clamours were fo great, that he could proted him no longer; and accordingly he was delivered to the enraged Mob, who forthwith fir angled him, and threw his Body on a Dung-hill by the Side of an High-way, where I law it two Days after. And the Mufti and Bafhaw made Matters up for the Fafe and Satisfadion of the People* who grew quite tired of their Divifions. ^ Bajfora was many Years in the Hands of llie 'FerJIansy who gave great Encourage ment to Trade, which drew many Merchants 'rom foreign Parti to fettle there, and parti- ' cularlyof the Eaft Indies; 8j; Cula.rly from Stir at in India, But in Anno 1691. a Peftilence raged fo violently, that a- bove 80000 People were carried off by ir^ and thofe that remained fled from it, fo that for three Years following it was a Defert, inhabited only by wild Beafls, who were at laft driven oiit of the Town by the Circum jacent wild y&amp;vz&amp;r, who pofTeft it about ix Months, and were in their Turn driven out by the Turky who keeps it till this Day 5 but its Trade is very iuconfiderable to what it was in the Times that the T.erjlans hacj it, and the Reafon is, that the Turks are very infol^nt to ftrariger Merchants, in Anno. 1721. I had an Inflance of their arbitrary Infolence, for I fold a cpnfiderable Quantity of Pepper, which fome ftranger Merchants bargained.to take at i8 Mamoodies * a Mannd Attarie^ with out Deduftions. The Bafhaw being made acquaint with the Contraft, fent Orders, that, the Pepper muit be delivered to two Mini ons of his at 24 MamoodieSy and allow them t Turk and Burk, which is a Piece of Stone or Brick between a Pound and an half or two Pounds Weight, into the Scale with the Standard Weights, belldes the Tare of the Bags. I at fir ft refufed to comply with the unjufl Order, and flood out three or four Days, but at laft was advifed by fome Surat Merchants (who wer6 there, and had met t Fx with * 28 Mamoodies are 17 Jh 6 ef- A Mturtd Attavle is 28 Uh t Turkztid Bark is a c^ymary Donation, fuch as Tret ic Britain,ww Account with as great OpprefHons) to obey^ left I Hiould run the Rifque of being plundred by the Soldiery. T here are many Jews in Bajfora who live by Brokrage and exchanging Money; but the Turks keep that Set of People yer/ low, for Reafons of State. There are alfo a- bout ioo Chrtftians of the Greek Church, but no Priells of that Communion, wherefore fome ifo^;/Miffionaries officiate there. The Greek Clergy are very indifferent about gain ing Profelytes, and, to nourifli their Flocks, will not run the Rifque of Martyrdom, fo they keep none of their Priefthood at Bajfo ra : But when I was there, three Romijh Priefts of the Carmelite Order had the Super- intendency of that Church. Thefe fandifi- ed Rafcals were a Scandal to Chrijiianity, by making a Tavern of their Church; for hav ing more Indulgence from the Government than Mahometans, in moral Matters, they abufe it to the vileft Ufes, in felling Arrack, which they difHI from Dates, and procuring Birds of Paradife for the Ufe of their Culto- mers. The Mahometans again are forbidden fiddly the Drinking of Wine or diftilled Li quors, both by their eccleliaftick and civil Laws; .for the Heat of the Sun, and the dry fandy Soil create much aduft Choler in their Brains, that when they are heated by drink ing flrong Liquors, they become furious and mifchievous to one another, and, in thofe mad Fits, wound and kill their Fellows. Thofe fcandalous Priells had been often re- priman-^ Eaft Indies. 85 primanded by the Government, for abufing the Indulgence they had, but to little Pur- pofe, for their Trade was very gainful; but, upon a drunken Quarrel between two Sea men of mine, wherein one was dangeroufly wounded with a Knife, and the other, for reai of Puniihment, turned Mahomet be ing before a 'Portugueze Chriflian, the Ba- Ihavv fent an Officer and Soldiers to enter the Church, and all thelrloufes appertaining to it, with Orders to break their Stills and Jars, with the reft of the dialling Utenfils, and to pour out all the Arrack they found, on the Ground, which was accordingly done ; and, in the Search, the Soldiers met with a fine Silver Watch, and about 400 Spamjb Dollars, which they carried off with them. The Priefts petitioned the Bafliaw to have the \V atch and Money reftored ; but were an- fwered, that they preacht much on the Contempt of worldly Riches, and if his Soldi ers had made them pradife what they preacht, they ought to be thankful, and to let the de- fpicable Money continue in Hands that pro- feft their Love of it, and knew much bet ter how to ufe it than Priefts, and fo difmift them, with I, hreats of harder Penalties on their next Tranfereffion: But the Sweets of worldly Gains foon made them forget the Admonition given them by the Bafliaw, as well as their heavenly Promifes and Oaths made at their Admiftion into their holy Order; and, like a Dog to his Vomit, returned back r o their old Trade of debauching Qhriftiansy ^ 3 Jews %8&lt;5 new Account Jews, Mahometans andwith Liquors, and fet up Stills for that Purpofe once more. Notwithstanding that the Turkifh Government is fo well eftablifhed by Severi ty, and even Cruelty when their Laws are tranfgreffed, yet the Arabs, who are the na tural Lords of their own Country, are not to be' rigoroufly dealt with, for they are a People very bold, revengeful and cunning. \VhiIe I was at B a [for a, a Parcel of Janifa- ries were fent to the Ifland of Gabon, which lies between the City and the Mouth of the River JZufhratts.

They firft built a Sconce, and fortified it, both to fecure themfelves from fudden Attacks or Surprize, as well as to hold what they might diftrain from the poor Peafants. Many of thofe poor Wretches having experimented the Turkifh wholefom Chaftifements of plun- dring and baftonading thofe who fcrupled to obey, 6r were not able to pay what they were taxed, making their Complaints to one another, and bewailing the Milery that they underwent by the inexorable Janifaries, took Counfel to ferret them oS their Ifland atof the Eaft Indies. 87 the Hazard of their Lives, rather than con tinue under the unfupportable Yoke they were in; wherefore about three hundred of them prepared for an Attack on the Janifa- nes Jittle Fort, with no other Weapons than Lances and Swords, There were about for ty Janifaries in the Fort, well armed with Ouns; but the Arabs defeated the Defam or Powder and Ball, by making up great J-)und]cs of Straw, that covered them intire- ly from Head to Foot whilfl their Faces were towards their Enemy. They waited a con venient Time when the Wind was pretty high, and marching towards the windward- Uiolt Part of the Fort, fet Fire to their Straw, whole Blaze and Smoke kept the Janilaries clear from molefting them to windward. 1 here were fome Shades within the Fort, puilt of Date Tree Leaves, for lodging the Ganfon, but they took Fire alfo; and five or fix Barrels or Powder blowing up, de- ftroyed molt of the Janifaries, and fome few who leapt down the Outfide of the Wall, were killed with the Sword; fo that, between Fire and Sword, not one efcaped.

They will floop at full Speed, and take up an Hare as ihe runs, with their Hands, or throw a Lance in the Air, and catch it before it comes to the Ground: And indeed the moft of their pxercife, whilft young, is in managing their Horfes. They have many Boats on the River, of feveral Shapes and Dimenfions ; fome are made of Wood, with high broad Boughs, and very Iqng, others are very fliort: TheirRudders are in Breadth a Quarter Part of their Keel's Length, but not intire of one Piece as ours are, and they daub them over Outfide and Infide with Bitumen, without caulking them ; others are B^iskpts made of Reeds, perfedly round, with two Sticks laid athwart crofs-ways their Bottoms to keep them open. They are alfo daub'd on the Outfide and Bottom with Bi tumen. And this Sort they make ufe of to tranfport Goods from Place to Place.

Gives a Defeription of the Sea-eoaf of Per- fia, from Euphrates to Gombroon, with the Places of Commerce on the Perfian Side of the Gulf THEY have a Tradition, that between B a (fora and Comer a was Job's Habita- t ion, if he had any; but that is out of my Sphere, and lo I'll travel down the Enphra-f tes again towards Terfia. T or above 10 Leagues to the eaft ward of the Chanel for Shipping, or from Marfan Point, the Land is very low and marirti, and is overgrown with Reeds and Shrubs, which, in the Month of are very dry by the extreme Heats of June and Ju ly-, and the Winds blowing frefh, put them in fo great Agitation, that by Fridion they take Hre; fo that before we fee any Land, we fee great Smokes by Day, and great Fires by Night, of 4 or 5 Leagues long. But at c Durea y which I take to be the eaftermoft Branch of the River, the Land is pretty high, and fome Date^ Trees to be feen from the ^ ea - And thefirft Mountains that appear in 1 crfia, are thofe of Bander-dillon^ which is a large Town on the Sea-coaft. It has large Plains near it, that produce Plenty of Wheat and Bar- icy, and have good Pafturage forHorfesand Cattle, As alio docs Bander-rick^ another Sea-port Town, and may be feen plainly from the Sea; but the Bay is fliallow fo far off; tha^90 A new Account that a Ship cannot come within three Lea gues of it; however it has pretty good in land Trade, by reafon of its Vicinity to Shy- rdft), the fecond Town in 'Perfia for Magni tude, from whence it is but fix Days Jour ney for Beafts of Carriage. Bowch'ter is alfo a maritim Town, about 12, Leagues to the Southward of Bander- rick. It ftands on an Ifland, and has a pret ty good Trade, both by Sea and Land. The Iflands of Car rack ly, about Weft North-weft, ii Leagues from Bowch'ter. One of them has no Inhabitants but Deer and An telopes. The fouthermoft has between x and 300 poor Fifliers on it, who ferve Shipping with Pilots for Baffora. It affords good Mut ton and Fifh, and Potatoes and Onions, with good Water. The Anchoring-place is at the North End of the inhabited Ifland, in ix Fa thoms Water. Their Language is Arabick x and Religion Mahometan, Aboux 7 Leagues to the Southward of Bowchier, on the Sea-coaft, is - Cur choir^ where are the Ruines of a large Caftle and Pier that jets a pretty Way into the Sea. They were built by the 'Portugueze, who kept a Garifon there, and had Gallies continually cruizing about in the Bottom of the Gulf, to compel all Ships that traded there, or to Baffora^ to pay 10 per Cent, Toll orCuftoms to them. There is nothing elfe to invite Ob- icmtion for Travellers, from Cur choir to Congoun % which is about 30 Leagues, but highof the Eaft Indies. jpf high, dry, barren Mountains, and hideous Precipices. Congoun (lands on the South Side of a large River, and makes a pretty good Figure in Trade; for moft of the Pearl that are caught at Bareen, on the Arabian Side, are brought hither for a Market, and many fine Horfes are fent thence to India, where they gene rally fell well. And four Days Journey with in Land, is the City of Laar, which, accor ding to their fabulous Tradition, is the Bu- rying-place of Lot, and they pretend to fliew his Tomb flill; but they do not know a Word about the poor Woman his Wife. That there are many Mountains of Rock Salt there, is very certain. T he next maritim Town, down the Gulf, is Cong, where the Tortugueze had lately a Factory, but of no great Figure in Trade, tho' the Town has a fmall Trade with Ba~ wans and Moors from India. The many In- fults the Muskat Ariths give it with their fleet, frighten Merchants of confiderable Stocks from frequenting it. After the Tor- tugueze loft Ormus, and a Peace made with Shaw Abafs the King of Terjfia, they were permitted to fettle at Cong. But that King built the City of ' ' Gombroon, or, as the Natives call it, Ban der AbaJJi, or the Sea-port of AbajJL This City ftands on a Bay, about 4 Leagues to the Northward of the Eaft End of the Ifland of Kifmijh, and 3^ Leagues from the famous Orrnuze, which the EngUJh had lb great an v Hand91 A new Account Hand in reducing to the Obedience of Shaw Abafs. What Time the Tortugueze fettled on Ormuze I know not, nor could I ever learn from the Terfians that I converfed with, when they did fettle; but finding it a convenient Place to tyrannize over the Tra ders into the Gulf of Terjia, they built a large Fort on the Eaft End of it, almoll en vironed by the Sea that waflies the Fort IValls. This Gombroon was formerly a Filli- ing Town, and, when Shaw Abafs began to build it, had its Appellation from the Tortu- fueze in Derifion, becaule it was a good ^lace for catching Prawns or Shrimps, w hich they call Cameroyg. The Englijh and Dutch have their Factories here, whtch bring a good Commerce to it; and the French formerly had their Faftory too. It is ill feated, and Wants almolt every Thing that contributes to the Support of human Life, except Fifli and Mutton ; yet, for many Years, it has^ been well peopled by reafon of its Trade, w 7 hich has filled the Pockets of many Mer chants, who, at their fir 11 fettling there, were very empty. They have no drinkable Water within three Miles of the Town, except a few Cifterns, which are dry above one Half of the Year: And the Hills, near it, are bar ren, and the very Rocks tafte of Salt. And, when Rain falls, which is but feldom, the Rivulets ( which are filled by the Waters running down the Hills into low Grounds) bear a Cruft of fine white Salt on their Sides, tjut is bittcrifli, by reafon of too much Nitre andof the Eaft Indies. 9^ and Sulphur in its Compofition. People of Diltindion and Fortune keep a Camel or two daily employed in bringing them frefli whole- fom Water ixova Jljfeen^ about Miles from the City, becaufe the Water of Naban, which is three Miles off, is not accounted falubri- ous. There is an high Mountain that lies North from Gambroon, about 8 Leagues, whofe Refleftion of Heat on the lower Ground, in the Summer Months, almofl fires the Air, which creates much Uneafinefs and Unhealthfulnefs to the Inhabitants of Gom broon; wherefore moft of them .'retire into the Country, to pafs the Heats of June^ Ju~ ly and Auguji, whofe Heats affcdi the Sea, in fo much that in Augujt there comes a Stink from it, that is as detettable as the Smell of dead Animals on the Land ; and vaft Quan tities of fmall Shell Fifli are thrown on the Shore by the Surges of the Sea; from them I judge the intolerable Sfink proceeds. It tarniflies Gold and Silver, as bad as the bilge Water of a tight Ship. A bout 10 Miles from Ajfeen, at the Foot of the aforefaid Mountain/js a Place called Minoa, where are natural cold and hot Baths, which cure Itches, Poxes, Leprofy and rheu- matick Pains, only by bathing, for they are not drinkable ; and fome that try to drink them, and get a few Spoonfuls down, find them powerful Emeticks. There are two or three little Choulteries or Shades built for Patients to reft in; but there are no People that inhabit near it, fo that whoever goes there.94 y4 new A ■ there, muft carry all NecelTaries or Conveni- encies along with them. A t AJfetn there are many Gardens^ where the Inhabitants of Gombroon retire to in the liot Months; but the Englijh Eajl-india Com pany's is the beft, and bed cultivated. It produces Plenty of Seville Oranges, whofe Trees are always verdant, and bear ripe and green Fruit, with Bloflbms, all at once. In rhe hot Seafon it is well watered from its Wells, fo that Roots and Herbage are plen tiful, and good in their Seafdns, which fupply the Faftory at Gombroon: And there is pret ty good Fowling and Hunting in that Plain; but tKe Road to the Town is only paffable for M&amp;ij and Afles or Camels, But not for Hbrfes: Nor are. there any Houfes on the^ Road, but one Facktre\ or Beggar's Lodge. But Naban is a Village pretty well peopled, and has one Tree, or rather a Woodfprung from the Root of a Tree, whofe Branches fpread wide, and from them other Branches defcend to the Ground, and take Root, and the Branches of them fpread as the firft did, that it became near three hundred Yards from one End to another, and could Ihelter ioooo Men from the Heat of the Sun. The Leaves are large and thick, and it bears a red Berry, only ufeful for Crows and Parrots, who alfo build Nefts on the Tree. Gombroon is very unhealthy for Europeans^ OGcafioned by the fcorching Heat of Summer,; and peircing Cold of Winter; for as thofe that ftay there in Summer have Wind- chim-of the Eaft Indies. of chimnies to cool and fan them, fo they are obliged, in Winter^ to wear Cloth Coats, li ned with Fur, to keep them warm. The Europeans often haften Death fooner than he would come of his own Accord, bv In temperance and Debauchery of feveral Kinds; and they have a Burial-place pretty near the Town, well llored with Tombs, but never a Chrijiian Church in this Town, tho' the T ort ugtteze have one at Cong, where generally refide a Prieft or two, who fubfift on Alms and Perquifites. When an Ettglijh or 'Dutch Heretick marry, or bring the Fruits of their Labour to Light unmarried, then the Prieft is fent for to make the Infant a Chrijiian ; but we officiate in Burials ourfelves. The animal Provifions of Cattle, Sheep, Goat, Fowl and Filh, are all in their Kind good, and pretty cheap; but they kill no Cows publickly, becaufe the Battyaus from India, who make a good Figure in the Town, and are pretty numerous, give the Sbanajheen or Governor, a yearly Prefent of Value, to prohibit Cow-killing, for they being all Ty- thagoreans in the Belief of Tranfmigration, worlhip that Beaft in as great a Degree of \ eneration as a Tapift does the Image of a Saint given him for a Proteftor. The De votees of both differ not much in Point of Adoration; for fetting afide fhe Divinity of Cattle, who till the Ground, and nourifh them by their Milk, which, they fay, is more than a dead Image can do, they have greater An tiquity, and as great Authority as Chriftian Idola-A new Account Idolaters can pretend to. Their Books are as numerous, and their Traditions and Le gends as full in relating Prophecies uttered by the Cow, as wdl as Miracles performed by her, as the Others can boaft of done by their Images; lb'they laugh at a Taftji that calls them Idolaters. The Grapes, Melons and Mangoes that fupply the Market of Gombroon^ come from the high Mountain beforementioncd, or from the V allies on the North Side of it.

Shyrajh is a large City on the Road, about 550 Miles from Gombroon^ in a fine, pleafant fertil Country, that produces Fruits of all Sorts, excellent in their Kinds, particularly Apples, Pears, Phimbs,Figs, Wall-nuts, Chef- nuts, Hazel-nuts, Piflacio-nuts, and Grapes which afford good W ines, and Raifins, and is fo well ffored with Rofes, that they can yearly export 1000 Chells of Rofe-water, be- fides ten Times as much fpent in Terfia, A- rahia and Indufian.

TH E Empire of Terjia is of a large Ex tent, being limited by Euphrates and the Terjlan Gulf to Weftward, the Indian Ocean, from Cape Guaddel, to the South ward, on the' Eaft Side by the River Indus, that runs hoc Miles to the Northward from its Mouths/ and on the North, by Us beck. Tart aria, Colchis, Mangrelia, the Cafpian Sea and Georgia. Erivan in Armenia, is a Province in the North-weft of it, as Cabul and Candaha are on the North-eaft Side. To wards Turkey they fometimes lofe and get whole Provinces in a Year. About the Be ginning of the feventeenth Century, Shaw Abafs was King of 'Perfla, a King worthy of Empire, and made himlelf famous by his Va lour and Juilice; but having no Fleet at Sea, the Tortugueze infulted his Sea-coafts, and fettled themfelves on the Ifland of Ormuze, and built a good ftrong Fort, as is already obferved, with a pretty large Town, and magnificent Churches. Some Porches and broken Pillars I have feen, that fpeak their ancient Grandeur ; and the Caftle is ftill good,, and well kept. The Tortugueze, with theirof the Eaft Indies. iojc : their light Frigats and Gallies, infulted the Sea -coails of Terfia, and all the Shipping that had Commerce in the Gulf, for above a whole Century. Shaw Abafs being tired with the Complaints of his Subjerts, and o- thers that^ had been robbed and infulted by the imperious Tortugueze, made him very imeafy, and found no Remedy but by encou raging the Englijh, who then had a fmall Fa- dory on the Sea-fhore, about 7 Leagues from the Mouth of the Gulf, to the Eatt-ward, cal led Jafques, but were continually difturbed in their Commerce by the domineering Tor* tugueze from Ormuze, Sir Thomas Row being then AmbafTador at the Court of Terjia for King James the Firft of England, to cultivate a Correfpon- dence between the two Kingdoms, Shaw A* bafs broke his Mind to Sir Thomas, and pro- ferred any reafonable Indulgence to the En~ glijh that traded into Ter/la, providing they would joyn his Land Forces with theirs at Sea, in India, to drive the troublefom 'Por-' tugueze out of the Terfian Gulf. Sir Thomas agreed, that, if Shaw Abafs would defray the Charges of the Ships that fliould come to his AlMance, give the Englijh a free Trade all over the Terfian Dominions, Cu- ftom free, and grant them, one Moiety of the Cufloms raifed by Merchandize in the Gulf, they would not only help to drive the Tor tugueze out of Ormuze, but keep two Ships in the Gulf, to proteft Trade. All whicl^jOi A new Account which was agreed to by both Parties, and fealed and figned by the King of Terjia. T he Forces confifted of five Ships, about 40 Guns one with another, and were well mann'd. The King of Terfia fent an Army of 40 or 5*0000. with Trankies for Transports, to land them on Ormuze. The En gitjh foon dellroyed the Tortugueze Ar- mado of light Frigats and Gallies, which were hal'd dry on the Land near the Caftle, The Caffle firing briskly on them, funk one of the Englijh Ships, whofe Artillery was carried afliore, and put in Batteries to an noy the Cartle, which the Shipping and Bat- teries did fo effedually, that, inlefs than two Months, the Tortugueze capitulated to leave Ormuze, with all the Fortifications intire, and to carry nothing away but their noble felves. The Plunder, which was very great, was e- qually divided between the Enghjh and Ter- nans-, and Tradition reports, that there was lo much ready Bullion found in the Caftle, that it was meafured by Long-boats-full; and one Boat being pretty deep, and an Officer lUll throwing in more, put the Boatfwain of the ohip, who was in the Boat, into a Pa/fi- on, and made him fwear, that for every Shovel-full that they threw more in, he would throw two out into the Sea; for he could not tell what would fatisfy them, if a Long-boat Load of Money would not. On Redudion of the Ifland and Fort of Or- rnuze, the 'Portugueze withdrew their Men from the l^orts of Juarackay another I- fland1 of the Eaft Indies. 10} iland 4or ^Leagues from Omtuxe, and from K'tfm'tjh Fort, that lies on the Eall End of that Ifland, and retired to Muskat. Sbaiu Ahafs was punftual in obferving the Agree ment with the Englijh ; and it was punctu ally kept by the fucceeding Kings, till about the Year 1680. the Englijh Company failed on their Part of keeping the Gulf clear of In^ fults; and the &lt; PerJians^ finding that the En- glijh Company's Forces were now too fmall for the increafing Power of the Arabs their Neighbours, took away the half Culloms, and allow them 1100 Tomaans, which is a- bout 3300 Pounds Sterling a Year; but lam afraid that that is alfo loll by the late Revo lution in i FerJia. W hen Shaw Abafs demifed, his Son Shaw Tonias fucceeded him, who was a Son wor thy of fuch a Father. He died about the Year 1630. He was a very valiant and for tunate Prince in his Wars with Turk and MogitL, and a great Lover of Jullice; for whoever broke the eilablilhed Laws, were fure to fuffer the Penalty annext to them. One Inftance of that he (hewed on a Baker; for, being once detefted in making his Bread lighter than the Standard, he was feverdy fined; but, on his being deteded and con- vifted a fecond Time, he was condemned to be bak'd in his own Oven, for a Terror to others, who might flatter themfelves with breaking the Laws with Impunity.

A very flagrant In- ilance is to be feen in Mer 'iweys\ Revolution. The whole Reign of the laft Sophi, or King, was managed by fuch Vermin, that the Bat loaches and Mackrans, who inhabit the oea-coafl from Cape Jafques to Indus, ob- leiving the Weaknefs or the Government, threw off the \ oke of Obedience firfl, and, in full Bodies, fell in upon their Neighbours in Carviunta, who were thriftier and richer than the maritim Freebooters, and plundred their fellow Subjefts of what they had got by their painful Indufhy. There was no Want ot Remonilrances and Petitions put into the Comt to put a Stop to thofe Enormities, but no Redrels could be had. Thecame alio on their neighbouring Province of MuF- chety and committed many Depredations ; w Letters came from the Governor ot that Province, to acquaint the King of the Us berks Incurfions, he happened then to be at Flay with a young Cat, that hunted a reather that he kept in Motion with a Thread. &lt;Jne ot the Pages acquainted him, that a Mellenger was come in great Hafte from Mujcbct, with Letters to the Vizier, who Chamber Door, to know what _iis Majefly woujj pi ea f e t0 or( j er j n t j iat juLt-iu-ic He anfwered, that affoon as he hadof the Eaft Indies. '105 had done playing with his Cat, he would fend for the Vizier, and confult of that Mat ter ; but he never thought more of it. This Indolence made many Thefts, Robberies and Murders to be committed throughout the Country: Nay, his own Guards went out in Troops, and way-laid Merchants going or coming to or from Iffahan, robbed them, and often murdered them; and when Com plaints were made, and Proof offered, yet no Redrefs could be had, which made moft People believe, that fome Court Favourites were Encouragers of the publick Calamities. In Anno 1716. 1 carried fome Mer^ chants from Ter/la to Suraty who aflured me, that there was a Defign to depofe the King, and fet up his Son, or invite the Muf* covite into the Province of Casbhiy whofe Shores are on the Cajpian Sea, and where a foreign Army may eafily be brought into their Ports by Sea: And certainly there was luch a Defign; for in Anno 1719. the Plot of depofing the King was found out, and the Attamadoulet or Vizier was deeply concern ed in it. He was Meriweys\, or Meir Ma* houmud Shaw's Father, the Son being then Chawiiy or Prince of Candahaar. The King was folacing himfelf in a Garden near the City of I/pahan, when he was apprifed of the Plot, which was to be executed the fame Night it was difcovered. He immediately fent for the Attamadoukty pretending Bufi* jiefs of Importance about fome Frontier Pro vinces, and the old Gentleman not dreamingjotf A neio Account of the Diicovery made, came to the King, who taxing hirri with the Plot, made no Dif ficulty to confefs that it was of his own Contri vance, to fa ve the Country from Ruin, which was inevitable, if he continued in Supine- nefs, which had affefted him near 40 Years, and there was no Sign of Amendment, not- withftanding his Remonftrances and Admo nitions all that while, and now that he was cJeted:ed, he knew the worll that could be- fal him, was to be facrificed for the Good of his Country, which he took to be rather glorious than diflionourable. The King order ed fome Bars of Iron to be heated, and his Eyes kept open till the Irons were gently moved near die Eyes to dry up the Moillure, which is the royal Punilhment in Ter/ia, for difobedient or rebellious Princes; fo the old Man being made blind, his Treafure wasfei- fed, but his Palace and Gardens allowed him, and an Allowance fuitable to his Dig- nity. He had in Gold and Diamonds, to the V alue of 800000 Tomaans or 2400000 Pounds Sterling ; and fome faid he had more in his Sons Cuftody: Hut how true thefe Reports are, I am no proper Judge, either to believe or rejed ; but fome Bars of his Gold I faw at Gombroon. ^ B efore this Confpiracy of the Attama- aoulet happened, the Muskdt Arabs came with a Fleet, and landed 5 or 6000 Men on Ormuze^ and befieged the Caflle; but could fc&amp;e it in three Months, and being tired with fatigue, they left it. But in Anno 1720. Meri-of the Eaft Indies. ioy Meriweys hearing how the King had ufed his father, made the whole Province of Candahaar rebel, and wrote Letters to the Chawn of Samach 'ie to come into Alliance with him and his Confederates the Ballowches and Dsbecks, who readily embraced his Pro portions in Hope of Plunder.

Me- riweys began his March towards Ifpahan, with an Army ot 45'ooo. and paid honellly for what his Army had Occafion for in his March, declaring, that he did not take Arms for their Hurt or Deftru^Hon, but to free Ter* fia from the Folly and Tyranny of a doting rool^who was incorrigible by fair Means. The ^Osbecks entred the Provinces of Muf* thet and Tefd, with 40000. and afted like Robbers. Another Army of 40000 went out of Samachie, and ravaged Erivan ; and the Ballowches entred the Province of Carmania? and plundred the Country, and at laft took the City. Then they marched towards La- dr, and took the Town, but not the Fort; And there twelve Hollanders^ who werefent from Gombroon to convey down fome Trea- fure belonging to their Company, behaved themfelves to Admiration. They were lod ged in a Caravanjeray, where the Ballow ches came with about 300 to attack them; but they had a brave warm Reception, and left about four Score of their Number dead on the Spot, without the Lofs of oneZter/fr Man: But not thinking themfelves and their Treafure fafe where they were, they defired Admittance into the Fort, which was readf- tyio8 A new ly granted, and there they alfo behaved them- felves fo well, that the Ballowches marched away without the Booty they came lb far for. The 'Dutch {laid there above a Month, and in that Time came a Detachment of 4000 Horfe to plunder Gombroon. We heard of their Defign about ten Days before they came, and fo we and iheUutch fortified our Fadk)- ries as well as poffibly we could, planting little falconets on the Top of our Walls in Swivels, and beating out Ports in our Walls, to ply great Guns, to fcour the Avenues to our Faftories. Mean while the Terfian Go vernor fired Guns every Night, to let the E- nemy know he was a brave Fellow: Howe ver thev had a Mind to fee, and, on the 15 of 'Decembef-y they appeared near the Town, on a fwift March towards it, which feared the Governor fo much, that, tho 7 there was an high Mud Wall between him and them, he got on Horfe-back, and fled to a Fort on the Sea-fliore, leaving a few Guns, loaded as they were, to the Enemy. The B allow ches came firft to the Weft Quarter of the Town, where our Faftory ilands, and foon made Palfages through the Mud W alls. They hewed down all that came in theirWay, particularly old People and Chil dren, and came in a confufed Halle to attack our Factory, down fome Lanes; but we gave them a warm Welcom with our great Guns and fmall Shot. They foon found their Mi- flake, and retired in as great Hafte as they came, Some of their Musketeers got into fomcof the Eaft Indies. 100 fome ruined Houfes, and fired on us; but we being barricadoed, they did us little Damage, and had our Men obferved their Orders better, we had come off with left. Our Firing lafted about three Hours, in which Time we loll three or four, killed by their own Raflmefs in Handing open to the Enemy, when they might have done bet ter Service under Cover of our Barricadoes, We had alfo feven wounded, but none mor tally, but one who was a Faftor, who re ceived a Shot in his right Hand, which threw him into a Fever, of which he died in feven or eight Days. The Agent being gone to I pah an fome Weeks before we had any Ad vice of the BalLowches coming, had carried twenty Soldiers along with him for a Guard, and left but fix in the Factory, befides Cooks, and a few Servants. I faw the Fadory in Danger if they ftiould be attacked, fo I rein forced it with thirty fix of my bell Men, and another fmall EngUjh Ship from Bombay^ af- fifled with eight or nine of his, fo that when the Enemy came, we were about fifty flrong. The Seafon being very cold, made our Du ty hard, for we lay in our Arms every Night, for io or ix Nights that the Enemy lay in the Town. They had a Confultation next Day after their Repulfe, how they might make another Attack; but none would undertake to lead their Men on, and fo the Dav after Confultation, they went to attack the 'Dutch^ who were three Times flronger than we, and they met with the fame kind Reception we gaveHO A new Account gave them; but they had a Ware-houfe with-* in Piflol-ihot of their Fadory, with Goods to the \ alue of 20000 Pounds Steylin^ in itj which the Ballowches broke into, and plun- dred. The Dutch loft twelve Men, and had eight or ten wounded i So finding our Fadones were not to be taken without the Danger of much Blood-fhed, they went a plundring the Town for eight or nine DaySj and carried away, in Money and Goods, a- ^o v e 2,00000 Pounds, befides 14000 Captives, and as many Beafls of Carriage, and fo went oft about five or fix Miles from the Town, which they laid in Afhes before they left it. They continued in our Neighbourhood, with their Plunder, about a Month, I fuppofe till they received new Orders how to difpofe of themfelves. Not with STANDiNcfuch numerous re bellious Armies were a Foot, threatning De- llrudion to the State, the indolent King be^ ing lulled afleep in Security, did not offer to raife any Forces for the Defence of himfelf and Country, but faid to his Cabinet Coun- fellers, that he was fure his Enemies would leave him Ifpahan, and that one City would be enough to maintain him and them his Coun- fellers: But when Meriweys came within three Days Journey of the City, he raifed a- 2? Ut ^n 000 t ^ e Citizens, and fent to the Englijh and 'Dutch Agents, to joyn their little J orces to his, to manage the Artillery, and to lend him fome Money to fupport and pay his new nifed Army. The latter defi- redof the Eaft Indies. lit red to be excufed in both; but the EngUJh complied, and were veryadive in defending the City, when Meriweys came to beficge it: And when he approached within a ]Vl9e or two of the City, the King fent his raw Ar my out to fight Meriweys ; but in their March, Meriweys\ Men having made along Trench a pretty Way from their Front, and hid a large Quantity of Gun-powder in it, and then filled it up again, which Ambufcade the King's Army fell into, and, after a good Number of them had pafl it. Fire was iet to it, and blew up and fcorched many of the King's Men, which fo frightned the reft^ that they turned'Tail, and fled without flriking one Stroke, fo Meriweys made an eafy Con^ quelt of the City, and found the King weep ing, and deferted by his bafe and treache rous Courtiers. But Meriweys foon put an End to his Melancholy, by ordering his Head to be ftruck off, which was forthwith exe cuted, and put on the Point of a Lance, and carried thro' the City three Days fuccellively, as a Spedacle. The Prince royal, or the young Sophi feeing his Father's Affairs in fo wretched a Condition, had left the City, and went to Taurus or Teverize before Meri weys came. Meriweys carried himfelf migh ty civilly to the Citizens, but made the En- glifl) Prifoners, and feized what Money and Goods could be found of theirs, and alfo the 'Dutch Company's Effefts, but not their Ser vants Perfons. It was reported, that the En~ glijh loft about 60000 Pounds, and the Dutch iloqoo,i i z A nm Account iioooo. But the Truth of thefe Reports are bed known to themfelves. W hen the old King had a Mind to honour the Englijh Factory with a Vilit, as I faw in a Letter from Mr. Bruce the Company's A- gent, that he fometimes did, and one parti cularly in his Agency, he magnifies the Ho nour done to his Mailers, above what the Dutch could ever obtain. He relates how he and all the Fadory, great and fmall, were ordered to leave their Houfe, and Chamber Doors and Ware-houfes all open, for his Ma- jefly and his Seraglio Companions to ramble thro', and take luch Things as beft pleafed him and his Minions; and there»was a Table left in the Dining-room, fpread and furnifh- ed with the richeft Sweet-meats and Fruits. I believe the Company was not very am- bicious of having many fuch Honours con ferred on them, fince they were obliged to pay for them* And when the King has a mind for fome new Concubines, he iflues out Orders for all Men and Youths to depart out from their Houfes in the Street, that he is pleafed to vifit, and to leave all the Ladies in PoflefRon till his Majefty furveys them; and the Penalty of Difobedience is Death. He generally makes his Progrefs thro' the Arme- nian Quarters, becaufe the faireft and moil: beautiful are amongft their Children. The Religion, by Law eftabliihed for near eleven Ages, is Mahometan, of the Seft of Al* It ; but the ancient Religion was Tar/i, or .'Worlhippers of the Sun and Fire.

H aving made what Obfervations I could of the Empire of Terfia, I'll travel along the Sea-coafl towards Induflaity or the Great Mo- gul\ Empire. All that Shore, from Jafques to Sindy, is inhabited by uncivilized People, who admit of no Commerce with Strangers, tho' Guaddel and ^Diul, two Sea-ports, did, about a Century ago, afford a good Trade. C H A P. XL Treats of the Moguls 'Dominions on the Ri ver Indus, particularly of the ancient King dom of Sindy its 'Produfl and Commerce, Religion and Cuftoms of the Inhabitants; with a c Defcription of the River Indus. SINTiT is the weftmoft Province of the i MogiiVs, Dominions, on the Sea-coaft, and has Larribundar to its Sea Mart, which ftands about 5* or 6 Leagues from the Sea, on a Branch of the River Indus, capable to receive Ships of 200 Tuns. It is but a Vil lage of about 100 Houfes, built of crooked Sticks and Mud; but it has a large Stone Fort, with four or five great Guns mounted in it, to proteft the Merchandize brought thither, from the Robberies of the Ballow- chesof the Eaft Indies. 115 ches jmd Mackrans that ly near them, tQ the Weft ward, and the Jams to the Eaft ward, who being Borderers, are much given to Thieving, and they rob all whom they are able to mafter. The former are revolted Subje^s of Terfiay and the other are Sub jects of the Mogul \ but being fecured from the Aw of an Army's coming to chaftife their Inlblency, by the marifli Grounds they live in, and the rapid Tides of Indus, they make but little Account of their Sovereign's Pow er or Orders, and fo they commit Depredati ons on theCaftillas that pafs to and fro between Tatta and Larrtbundar, notwithftanding a Guard of 100 or xoo Horfe are fent along with them, by the Nabob or Vice-roy ofcTatta, for Proteddon; but often thofe Protedors fuf- fer theCaffillas to be robbed, pretending the Robbers are too numerous to be reftrained by their fmall Forces, and afterwards come in Sharers with the Robbers. Tatta is the Emporium of the Province, a Very large and rich City. It is about three Miles longj and one and an Half broad, and is about 40 Miles Diftance from Larr 'tbnn- dar, and has a large Citadel on its Weft End,- capable to lodge fooo Men and Horfe^ and has Barracks and Stables convenient for them, with a Palace built in it for the Nabob. All Goods and Merchandize imported or export ed between Tatta and Larribundar, are tranf- ported on Carriage Beafts, fuch as Camels^ Oxen and Horfes. The Country is almoft level, and overgrown with Shrubs and Bu- H i fties,^ji6 A new Account ihes, very fit to cover an Ambufcade^ which the aforefaid Robbers often make ufe of, and fuddenly rufh out on aCaffilla, and whilft the Guards and Carriers are fighting in one Place, either of Front, Flank or Rear, the Robbers drive away the Beafts with their Packs. In Anno 1699. a pretty rich Caffilla was robbed by a Band of four or five thou- fand Villains;'The Guard, confifling of Horfe, were intirely cut off, and above 500 of the Merchants and Carriers, which ftruck a Terror on all that had Commerce aiTatta. It was my Fortune, about four Months after, to come to Larribundar, with a Car go from Mallabar, worth above 10000 L. I could find no Tatta Merchants that would meddle with my Cargo before it was carried to Tatta ; but agreed on the Prices of moll of the Species of my Goods: And finding no other Remedy but travelling by Land, in a Caffilla of 15-00 Beafts, and as many, or more Men and Women, befides xoo Horfe for our Guard, about the Middle of January we fet out; and after we had marched about 16 Miles, our Scouts brought in News of the Ballowches and Mackrans being juft before us, in great Numbers. I had thirteen of my bell Firemen with me in the Front, where my Beaits were. We being all mounted on little Horfes, alighted, and fet our Beads on our Flanks andFront, to ferve us for a Barri- cadoe, to defend us from Sword and Target- men, which were the principal Strength of the Robbers, and we, at the lame Time, had Roomof the Eaft Indies. 117 Room enough to fire over our Barricadoe. We were not long in that Pofture, till the Enemy fent an Herald on Horle-back, with his Sword brandifhing, and when he came within Call of us, he threatned, that if we did not inftantly furrender at Difcretion, we ihould have no Quarters. I had two ot my Seamen that Ihot as well with a Fuzee as a- ny ever I faw, for I have feen them at Sea, for Diverfion, knock down a fmgle Sea~fowl with a fingle Bullet, as they were flying near our Ship. I ordered one to knock down the Herald, which he inftantly did, by a Bul let through his Head'. Another came pre-' fently after, with the fame Threatnings, and met with the fame Treatment, The next that came, I ordered his Horfe to be fliot in the Head, to try if we could take his Ri der, that we might learn lomewhat of the Enemy's Strength. The Horfe was killed aflbon as he appeared, and fome of our Horfe got the Rider, and hewed him down, in- Itead of bringing him to us. Our Guard of Horfe continually kept in the Rear, but fee ing what we had done in the Front, took Courage, and getting in am on git the Bulhes, met with fome that had a Defign to attack our Flank, and foon defeated them, which put the Robbers in fuch Fear, that they be took themfelves to Flight, and our Horfe purfuing, put many to the Sword; fo when they returned from the Purfuit, we went on in our Journey, and travelling four Miles, came to a Mud-wall Fort, called 'T&gt;nn^ H 3 ham *118 d new ham, a proper Englijb Name for fuch a For tification. It is built mid-way between Tat- ta and Larrtbundar, to fecure the Caffilla from being fet upon in the Night, who all lodge within it, Men and Beafts promifcuoully, which makes it fo nafty, that the Englijh Ap pellation is rightly beftowed on it. There are about twenty little Cottages built clofe to it, who breed-Fowls, Goats and Sheep, to fell to PafTengers. And thefe are all the Hou- fes to be feen in the Way between and Larribundar. T he News of a Viftory that I had over three Sanganian Pirates at Sea, on my Voy age from Malabar to Larrtbundar, had reacht Tatta, before the fecond Skirmilli by Land, fo that when I came to Tatta, we were received with Acclamations from the Popu lace, and the better Sort vifited us withPre- fents of Sweet-meats and Fruits, afcribing the fafe A rrival of the Caffilla wholly to our Courage and Conduft. We were lodged in a large convenient Houfe of 15- Rooms, and had good Ware- houfes. The Stairs from the Street, were in- tire Porphyry, of 10 Foot long, of a bright yellow Colour, and as fmooth as Glafs. They were about ten in Number, and led up to a Square of 15' Yards long, and about 10 broad. Next Day we had a Compliment from the Nabob, of an Ox, five Sheep, as many Goats, twenty Fowls and fifty Pigeons, with Sweet meats and Fruit in Abundance. He, at that i ime, lay encampt about fix Miles from the Town,of the Eaft Indies. 119 Town, with an Army of 8 or 10000 Men, with a Defign to punilh the Ballowches and Mackrans for robbing the Caffiila, and killing his Men, as is before mentioned. Hedefir- ed me to let him know when we defignedto drink a Difli of Coffee with him, and he would fend Horfes to bring us to the Camp. I returned Thanks for his Civility, and fent him Word, that I deilgned to kifs his Hand the very next Day; and he accordingly fent twenty fine ^Perfian Horles, well ecpippd, for my Ufe, ten of which I accepted tor my- felf and Guard to mount, and the other ten were mounted with fome of the molt conli-' derable Merchants in Tatta, who went to ac company me out ot Refped ; and, to make our Cavalcade appear with the greater Grace, allbon as we came to the Camp Gate, \ye would have alighted, but an Oiiicer on Hovle-' back told us, that it was the Nabob's Plea- fure, that we fhould be brought to his 1 ent on Horfe-back, and he riding before us, con duced us to the Tent Door, and, aiibou as we got from our Horfes, 1 was conducted into his own Pavilion Chamber, where he was fitting alone. The reft that came with me, were not admitted for an Hour after. It would take a great Deal ot T ime and Room to relate the Compliments and other Difcourfes that pad; but 1 knew the Cuilom, not to appear before great Men with an em pty Hand, I defired Leave to lay a little Prefent at his Feet, which he permitted. It confined of aLooking-glals of about $ Pounds H 4 inIZO A new Account in Value, a Gun and a Pair of Piftols well gilded, a Sabre Blade and Dagger-blade gild^- ed, and a Glafs Pipe for his Tobacco, and an embroider'd Standifh for it to fland in. He then fent for all who had accompanied me into the Room, and fhewed the Prefent I had made him, magnifying every Piece of it; and after fome Encomiums on my Valour and Generofity, told me, that I was a free Deni- fon of Tatta, with the Addition of an Indul gence of being free of all Cuftom and Tax on all Goods that I had brought or fhould export, and that whoever bought any Part of my Cargo, and did not pay according to the Agreement made for Payment, I ihould not be liable to feek Jufticeat the C^Vs Court, but to imprifon my Debtors, and if that would not perfwade them to give Satisfadi- on, he would fell their W ives, Children or ncarell Relations to make good their Debt. This Privilege did me lingular Service when the Term of Payments came, and was oblig ed to try the Experiment of imprifoning. After three Hours Converfation, we took Leave to go, and he difmitf us with much Civility, and told me, that when he return ed from that Expedition, he would repay my Vifit at my Lodgings; but in three Months that I Itaid, he did not return, but often fent ^ 0 rr^ u j» ie a ^ :er my Welfare, and how my Affairs flood. ^ In travelling from ^Dungham towards Tat- ta, about 4 Miles ihort of the City, on fmooth tiling Giound, there are forty two fine large Tombs,of the Eaft Indies. m Tombs, which, from the Plain, appeared to be a fmall Town. They are the 3urying- places of fome of the Kings of Sindy, when that Country was governed by its own Kings. I went into the largeft, which is built in the Form of a Cupola, and in the Middle of it, flood a Coffin-tomb, about three Foot high, and feven Foot long, with fome others of a leifer Size. The Materials of the Cupola were yellow, green and red Porphyry, finely polilhed, and the Stones fet in regular Order, Chequer-ways, which Variegation ftrikes the Eye with wonderful Pleafure, The Tomb is about io Yards high, and 7 in Diameter. I was told, that it was the Burying-place of the laft King ot that Country, who was rob bed of his Sovereignty by Jehan Grand father to the famous Aurenzeby in the Be ginning of the feventeenth Century, who, af ter he had him Prifoner, bid him ask what Fa vours he would defire forhimfelfandChildren, and they Ihould be granted. He nobly replied. That all the Favour hebegg'd, was, that him- felf, his Queen, and their Children, might be buried in that Tomb, which, in Times of Profperity, he had built for that Purpofe, and had coft him two Lack of Rupees, or 25-000 L. Sterl. which Requeft his Conque ror could not well refufe. Tatta City Hands about two Miles from the River Indus, in a fpacious Plain, and they have Canals cut from the River, that bring Water to the City, and fome for the Ufe of their Gardens. The King's Gardens were in prettyIZi A neta pretty good Condition in Anno 1699. and were well stored with excellent Fruits and Flow ers, particularly the mod delicious Pomegra nates that ever I tailed. For three Years before I came there, no Rain had fallen, which caufed a fevere Plague to affed the Town and circumjacent Coun try, to fuch a Degree, that, in the City on ly, above 80000 died of it, that manufadu- red Cotton and Silk, and above one Half of the City was dcferted and left empty. And that was one Reafon why the Nabob had pla ced his Camp in that Place that I went to vifit him at. The Figure of the Camp was a regular Tetragon, and ditched about with a Trench about 3 Yards broad, and x deep. The Ground taken out of the Ditch, was thrown upon the Infide, about 4 Foot high, and regularly built like a Parapet. It had 4 Gates, one in the Middle of each Curtain, and a llraight Street from the oppofite Gates, which made an exaft Crofs in Figure, and the Nabob's Tent was pitched in the Middle of the Crofs. Each Side of the Tetragon was about 6 or 700 Paces in Length, and the Ditches could be filled with Water from the Indus, and let out at Pleafure, into a large Marifli about two Miles off the Camp. The River Indus is navigable for their Veffels, as high as Cafmire, that lies in the Latitude of 31 Degrees ; and one Branch runs up to Cabul to the Weftward, and o- thers to T* enjeb, Lahore, Mult an, Btickor, and other large Provinces and Cities to the Eaft-of the Eaft Indies, 113 Eaftward, and all fhare the Benefits of the inland Navigation. Their VefiTels are called Kifties, of leveral Sizes. The largeft can lade about 200 Tuns. They are flat-bottomed, and, on each Side, Cabbins are built from Stern to Stem, that overhang about x Foot; and, in each Cabbin, is a Kitchen and a Place for Exoneration, which falls diredly in the Water. Thofe Cabbins are hired out to Paf- fengers, and the Hold, being made intofe- parate Apartments, are let out to Freight ers, fo that every one has a Lock on his own Cabbin and Apartment in the Hold, and has his Goods always feady to difpofe on at what Places he finds bis Market. And in deed in all my Travels I never law better Conveniencies of travelling by Water. They have one Maft of a good Length, and a Square-fail to ufe when the Wind is a-ftern, or on the Quarter; but they never hale clofe by the Wind. They are obliged to carry a great Number of Men for trading them up againft the Stream, when the Winds are a- gainfl: them, fo that a Voyage from Tatta to LaJoore^ they reckon fix or feven Weeks long, but from Lahore back, not above eighteen Days, and fometimcs it is performed in twelve. A t Tatta the River is about a Mile broad, and, where I tried with a Lead and Line, it was about fix Fathoms deep, from Side to Side. The Stream is not very .rapid, for its Motion did not exceed two Miles and an half in an Hour. It produces many Species of Freih-water Fifties, and among them, the bedA new Account Carp that ever I faw or tailed. Some of them weigh above 20 Pound Weight, and we have them alive in Tatta Market. They have black Cattle in great Plenty, large and good, and moft excellent Mutton, of 80 or 100 Pound Weight. Their Horfes are fmall, but hardy and fwift. Deer, Antelopes, Hares and Foxes are their wild Game, which they hunt with Dogs, Leopards, and a fmall fierce Creature, called by them a Shoegoofe. It is about the Size of a Fox, with long prickt Ears like an Hare, and a Face like a Cat, a gray Back and Sides, and Belly and Breaft white. I believe th^y are rare, for I never faw more than one. When they are taken out to hunt, an Horfe-man carries it behind him, hood-winkt, and their Deer and Ante lopes being pretty familiar, will not ftart be fore Horfes come very near. He who car^ ries the Shoegoofe, takes off the Hood, and Ihews it the Game, which, w 7 ith large fwift Springs, it foon overtakes, and leaping on their Backs, and getting forward to the Shoul ders, fcratches their Eyes out, and gives the Hunters an eafy Prey. The Leopard runs down his Game, which often gives the Hun-, ters a long Chafe, as well as the Dogs, who will take the Water when the Game betake themfelves to fwimming, which they fre- quently do. They have Store of Peacocks, Pigeons, Doves, Duck, Teal, Widgeon, wild Geefe, Curlews, Partridge and Plover, free for any Body to (hoot. They have a Fruit, that grows in their Fields and Gardens, cal ledof the Eaft Indies. 115 led Salob) about the Size of a Peach, but without a Stone. They dry it hard before they ufe it, and being beaten to Powder, they drefs it as Tea and Coffee are, and take it with powdered Sugar-candy. They are of Opinion, that it is a great Reftorative to decay'd animal Spirits. This Country abounds richly in Wheat, Rice and Legumen, and Provender for Hor- fes and Cattle; and they never know the Mi- fery of Famine, for the Indus overflows all the low Grounds in the Months of Aprils May and June, and when the Floods go off, they leave a fat Slime on the Face of the Ground, which they till eafily before it dries, and being fown and harrow'd, never fails of bringing forth a plentiful Crop. The other Produftions of this and the in land Country, are Saltpeter, Sal-armoniack, Borax, Opoponax, AfTa-foetida, Goat Bezoar, Lapis tut 'ia and Laf is lafuli, and raw Silk, but not fine. They manufadure in wrought Silks, which they call Jemawaars, in Cotton and Silk, cal led Qnttenees, and in Silk mixt with Carma- 7ua W ooll, called pulbuleys, in Calicoes coarfe and fine, iheer and clofc wrought. Their Cloth called Jurr 'tes, is very fine and foft, and lafts beyond any other Cotton Cloth that I have uied. They make Chints very fine and cheap, and Coverlets for Beds very beautiful. They make fine Cabinets, both lack'd and inlaid with Ivory, And the belt Bows and Arrows in the World, are made at116 A new Account at Multan, of Buffalos Horns. They kck wooden Diflies and Tables^ but not fo well as in China. The Lack is clear enough, but always clammy. They export great Quanti ties of Butter, which they gently melt^ and put up in Jars, called c Duj?pas, made of the Hides of Cattle, almoft in the Figure of a Glob, with a Neck and Mouth on one Side. They are made of all Sizes, from thofe that contain 310 lb. to thofe of and that But ter keeps, without Salt, the whole Year round, but, as it grows old, it becomes rank. The Wood Ligna dulc'ts grows only in this Country. It is rather a Weed than a W ood, and nothing of it is ufeful but the Root, called Tutchock, or, Radix dulcis. I never heard it is ufed in Phyfick, but is a good Ingredient in the Compofition of Per fumes. There are great Quantities exported for Surat, and from thence to China^ where it generally bears a good Price; for being all Idolaters, and burning Incenfe before their Images, this Root beaten into fine Pow der, and an Incenfe-pot laid over fmoothly with Afhes, and a Furrow made in the A- ilies, about a Quarter of an Inch broad, and as much in Depth, done very artificially in to a great Length, the Powder is put into that Furrow, and fired, and it will burn a Jong Time like a Match, fending forth a fine Smoke, whofe Smell is very grateful, the Powder having the good Qualities of main taining and delaying the Fire. Theof the Eaft Indies. 12.7 The Religion, by Law eftablilhed, is Ma hometan ; but there are ten Gentows or Ta- gans for one Muffulman. But the City of Tatta is famous for Learning in Theology, Philology and Politicks, and they have above four hundred Colleges for training up Youth in thofe Parts of Learning. I was very inti mate with a Seid who was a Profeflbr in Theology, and was reckoned to be a good Hiftorian. He askt me one Day, if I had heard of Alexander the Great in my Coun try. I told him I had, and I mentioned his Battle with Torus^ and his Vidory. He told me, that their Hiftories mentioned the fame, but with fome Difference in the two Kings Names, and Alexanders PafTage over Indus, He faid, that their Hiftory mentioned Shaw Hafander and ^Prorus, and that Alexander was a great Magician, and fummoning above a Million of wild Geefe, they fwam his Ar my over the River, and that Torus s Ele phants would never turn their Heads towards the Place where Alexander was. The Tortugueze had formerly a Church at the Eaft End of the City. The Houfe is flill intire, and in the Veilry are fome old Pidures of Saints, and fome holy Veftments, which they profered to fell; but I was no Merchant for fuch Bargains. The Gentows have full Toleration for their Religion, and keep their Fails and Feafts as in former Times, when the Sovereignty was in 'Pagan Princes Hands. They burn their dead, but the W ives are reftrained from bur- ningu8 new Account ning with the Corps of their Husbands. There is a very great Confumption of Elephants Teeth, for 'tis the Falhion for Ladies to wear Rings of Ivory from their Arm-pits to their Elbows* and from their Elbows to their W rifts* of both Arms; and when they die, all thofe Ornaments are burnt along with them* T hey had feveral Feafts when T was there* but one they kept on Sight of a New-moon in February, exceeded the reft in ridiculous Aftions and Expence; and this is called the Feaft of Woolyi who was a Knight errant in Time of yore, and was a fierce Fellow in si War with fome Giants, who infefted Studyy and carried away naughty Girls and Boys* and made Butcher Meat of them. ThistVoo- /y, in a Battle one Day* killed fifty of them, each of them as tall as a Tree, and, after he had difpatcht them, he led them down to Hell, and there they continue bound up to their good Behaviour, and are never to ap pear again on Earth, for Fear they lliould fear the King's Liege-fubjeds, or frighten Children.

T he firft Town on the South bide of In dus, is Cutchnapgen. It admits 'of iome Tiade* and produces Cotton, Corn, coaile Cloth and Chonk, a Shell-filh in bhape ot a I cin- winkle, but as large about as a Man's Arm above the Elbow. In Bengal they are faw d into Rings for Ornaments to \V omens Aras? as thofe ^of Sindy wear Ivory Rings. 1 hey are in Faihion in many Countries in India, The Province and Town of Cutchnaggen aic governed by a Queen, who is very foi mid- able to her neighbouring States. The Rea sons they give for choofmg that Sex for their Governclles, are, that they il be bettei advi- fed by their Council than Men, who, by too large a Share of Power and Honour placed on them, become obftinate in their Opinions, and infolent in their Behaviour: But Ladies are eileemed complifant and gentle. T he next Province ioCutchnaggen, is San- gania, which is alfo governed by a Princeis, for the above Reafons.- Their Sea-port is cal led Baet, very commodious and fecure. f hey J - admitof the Eaft Indies. i?[ admit of no Trade, but pradife Piracy. They give ProtedHon to all Criminals, who deferve Punifliment from the Hand of Juftice. All Villains in the Countries about flock thither, and become honell Robbers, fo that they are a Medley of Criminals, who flee their Coun try for Fear of condign Punilliment due to their Crimes. This Province produces Cot ton and Corn, as all the Kingdom of Guze- rat does; but they admit of no Trade in their Country, as I obferved before, for Fear of being civilized by Example. I had feve- i*al Skirmiflies with them. They, being con fident of their Numbers, ftrive to board all Ships they can come at by failing. Before they engage in a Fight, they drink Bang, which is made of a Seed like Hemp-feed, that has an intoxicating Quality, and, whilll it af- feds the Head, they are furious. They wear long Hair, and, when they let that hangloofe, they'll give no Quarter. ? In Anno 1686. a fmali Ship of theirs, that mounted 8 Guns, and mann'd with 500 of thefe furious Fellows, was cruizing on the Coaft of India, between Surat and Bombay}. and the Thenix, an Englijh Man of War of 4x Guns, was bound for Surat. The San- faman made towards her, and engaged her, ut would fain have been gone again when they found their Miflake; but that was im- poilible. The Thenix fent her Boats, well mann'd, to try if they could make them yield; in order to fave their Lives; but they fcorn- ed Quarter, and killed and wounded manv. t I £ 6fA new Account of the Englijhy fo that Captain Tyrrel, who commanded the ^Phenix, was forced to run his lower Teer out, and fink them: And, af ter their Ship was funk, and the Mifcreants fet a fwimming, yet mod of them refufed Quarter, and only about 70 were taken alive. (I believe Sir George Bing can give a better Account of the Story than I, for, if I miftake not, he was a Lieutenant then on board the 'Phenix, and received a dangerous Wound in the Combat, at leaft one of his Name, who bore a Commiflion, did.) In Anno 1717. they attackt a Ship called the Morning Star in her Paflage between Gombroon and Snrat. She was richly laden, which they were appri- fed of, and two Squadrons were fitted out from two different Ports, to way-lay her, and accordingly (he fell in with eight Sail of thofe Pirates. One was a large Ship of near 500 Tuns, and three others were Ships be tween x and 300 Tuns, and the other four were Grabs, or Gallies, and orhalf Gallies. They reckoned in all there were a- bove 2 ,000 Men in their Fleer, and the Mor~ Ti'tng Star but 17 fighting Men, who were re- folvcd to trull Providence, and fight for their Lives, Liberty and Lllate. The firft Attack was by the greateft Ship alone, but was loon obliged to llieer oil again, with the Lofs of fome Men, and the Captain ot the Morning Star was wounded in the Thigh, by a Lance darted at him, that pierced his Thigh through and through. The Pintes were not difcou- raged by this fiiit Repulie, but joyncd their Forcesof the Eaft Indies. Forces and Counfels together, and, after a Day's Refpite and Confultation, they attackt the Morning Star a fecond Time, the two lar- geft Ships boarding, one on her Bow, and an other on her Quarter, and three more board ed them two, and entred their Men over them. The C&gt;ombat was warm for above four Hours, and the Morning Star had feven killed, and as many wounded ; but kind Pro vidence aflilted her. Whilft fhe was on Fire in three Places, and had burnt through her Poop and half Deck, ihe was difengaged of them, and left five of the largeft fo entang led with one another, that they could not purfue her. So Hie purfued her Voyage to Surat, but having no Surgeon on board, fhe called at Bombay, to get her wounded Men drefl and cured. In the Time of the Com bat, while the Pirates were on board of the Morning Star, twenty one Indian Seamen went on board of them, and twenty fix Mer chants had gone to them, to try if they could perfwade them to take a Sum, and not put it on the Hazard of a Battle. All thofe they detained, and carried along with them, and made them pay above 6000 Pounds for 'their Ranfom, who gave an Account afterwards of great Slaughter done on the Pirates. And the Commodoi e loit his Head alloon as he landed, for letting fo rich a Prize go out of his Hands. In Anno one Captain Lavmdcr, in the onip Thomas, bound from Surat to Mo^ cha, encountred four Sail of thofe Freeboot- 1 } ers.1^4 ^ neew d.ccounl; ers, and fought them bravely ; but they burnt the Ship and all her Crew, becaufe he would not yield. They are very cruel to thofe they can mafter, if they make Refiftance ; but to thofe that yield without fighting, they are pretty civil. T he next Sea-port Town to Baety is Ji- gat. It ftands on a Point of low Land, called Cape Jigat. The City makes a good Figure from the Sea, ihewing four or five high Stee ples. It is the Seat of a Fouzdaar or Gover nor, for the Mogul. It is a Place of no Trade, and confequently little known to Strangers. 1 T he next maritim Town is Mangaroul. It admits of Trade, and affords coarfe Calicoes, white and died. Wheat, Pulfe and Butter for Export, and has a Market for Pepper, Su gar and Betlenut. It is inhabited by Banyans; and wild Deer, Antelopes, and Peacocks are lb familiar, that they come into the very Houfes without Fear. The next Place isTorcmain^ a pretty large Town on the Sea-Hiore, and admits of Trade, producing the fame Commodities as Manga- rouly and its Inhabitants are of the lame Re ligion ; but both Towns are obliged to keep Rajfpouts to proted them from the Infults of the Sanganians. Those Raff fonts are Natives of Guzerat, and are all Gentlemen of the Sword, and are well trained in the Art of killing. They, like the Switz, employ their Swords in the Ser- . vice of thofe who give them bed Pay. They feldom give or take Quarter, and when they ^ . goof the Eaft Indies 135 go on an Expedition, they carry their Wives and Children in Carts and Wagons along with them, and if they meet with a Repulfe, their Wives will never fuffer Cohabitation till they can regain their loll Honour by fome noble Exploit. T) 'iu is the next Port, and is the fouther- moit Land on Guzerat. It is a fmall Ifland of three Miles long, and two broad, belong ing to the Crown of Portugal. The City is pretty large, and fortified by an high Stone Wall, with Baitions at convenient Diftances, well furnilhed with Cannon to flank it, and a deep Mote hewn out of an hard Rock, to defend it on the Land Side, which is a- bout one third Part of the City. The other Parts are fortified by Nature, having the O cean thick fet with dangerous Rocks and high Cliffs, who forbid any Approaches on that Side, and a rapid deep River, that affords a good Harbour, on the North-eaft Side. The Harbour is fecured by two Cailles, one large, that can bring above 100 large Cannon to bear on the Mouth of the Harbour, to forbid Shipping Entrance without Leave. 1 The other is but fmall, and is built irregular ly on a Rock in the Middle ot the River, and Chanels for Shipping to pals by it, with in ten Yards of its Wall. It is made ufe ot for a Magazine for Powder and other war like Stores. I x is one of the beft built Cities, and bed fortified by Nature and Art, that ever \ law in India, and its ftately Buildings of free Stone I 4 andl$6 A new Account and Marble, are fufficient WicnefTes of its ancient Grandeur and Opulency ; but at pre^ fent not above one fourth of the City is in habited. It contains five or fix fine Church es, which are great Ornaments to the City, which flands on a riling Ground of an ealy Afcent from the great Caftle; and the Chur ches, being built wide from one another, and flanding gradually higher than one ano ther, make the Vijio from the Sea admirably pleafant, by ihewing all their beautiful Fronts that Way. And within they are well deco rated with Images and Paintings. There is a Tradition, that the Tortu- gtieze circumvented the King of Guzerat, as ^)tdo did the Africans^ when they gave her Leave to build Carthage^ by deliring no more Ground to build their Cities than could be circumfcribed in an Ox's Hide, w 7 hich hav ing obtained, they cut it into a fine Thong of a great Length, and over-reacht their Donors in the Meafure of the Ground. . A fter the City was built and fortified, it drew all the 1 rade from the King's Towns of Commerce thither, which made him hear tily repent his Generofiry ; and he made Pi opofals to the c Portugueze to reimburfe all the Charge and Expence they had been f*'' wou l c l reftore that Illand again, but he could never perfwade them to that Bargain, and fince fair Means would not do, he dengned to try what might be obtained by 1 orcc, wherefore he raifed a great Army, and pefieged it, but was foon forced to draw off a- gainof the Eaft Indies. 137 gain with Lofs, for the Tortugueze large Cannon from their Walls didurbed and di- flreft his Camp fo, that he found but little Safety for himfelf, and much lefs for his Hofi ^ ' .P Hi! This City came to fuch an Height of Trade and Riches in the fixteenth Century, that it drew a very potent Enemy from the Red Sea ; for, about the Year 15-40. theTar&amp;r deligning to have a Footing in India, caft their Eyes on T)iu, as being conveniently li- tuated, and well fortified for their Purpofe, fo they came in a Fleet of Gallies and Tran^ fports 15-000 ftrong, from Aden, and landed on the Weft End of the Ifland, and laid Siege to the City; but the 'Portuguese fent a Re inforcement from Goa, of twenty Sail, fome of which were large Ships or Galleons, who carried heavy Metal, with which they bat tered the Turkijh Fleet, being fmall VelFels, that many Turks.weve funk, and the Balhaw w 7 as forced to make oft with great Lofs and Shame, and leave their battering Artillery to the Tortuqjieze, for which Misfortune and Difgrace, he loft his Head when he returned to Aden. „ B ut about the Year 1670. the Muskat A- rabs had better Fortune, for they came with a Fleet of Trankies, and took an Opportuni ty to land in the Night, on the Weft End of the Illand, without being difcovered, and marcht filently clofe up to the Town, and, at Break of Day, when the Gates were, open ed, they entred without Refiftance. The AlarmI} 8 A nm Alarm was foon fpread over the Town, and happy was he who got firft to the Callle Gates, but thofe who had heavy Heels were facrificed to the Enemies Fury, who fpared none, fo in a Moment that fair rich City and Churches were left to the Mercy of the A- rabsy who, for three Days, loaded their Vef- fels with rich Plunder, and mounted fome Cannon in a great beautiful Church, and fir ed at the Fort, but to little Purpofe.

But the Arabs, like a Parcel of unfandi- fied Rogues, made fad Havock on the Chur ches Trumpery, for, belides robbing them of all the fan^ified Plate and Cafli, they did not leave one Gold or Silver Image behind them, but carried all into difmal Captivity, from whence they never returned that I could hear of. And as for the poor Images of Wood and Stone, they were fo rudely treated by thofe barbarous Infidels, that they came wdl off if they loft but a Limb, and I faw fome who loft their Heads: But by the indefati gable Induftry of the Clergy, their Churches are again as well, or better furnifhed with well carved Images of Wood and Stone than they were before; but I faw none of Gold orof the Eaft Indies. 159 or Silver to fupply the Places of the poor Captives. H o w e v e r , before the Arabs had done plun^ring, they became fecure and negligent, which the Governor having Notice of, pro claimed Freedom to all Slaves who would venture to fally out on the Enemy. Accord ingly about 4000 Soldiers and Slaves made a Sally with Succefs, killing above 1000 Arabs^ and made the reft flee from the Town, the Aftailants lofmg but very few; and by that one Sally the Town was regained. Thofe Slaves are generally Mofanmque and Mom- bafs Negroes, whofe Strength and Bravery I have mentioned before. The City ftill feels the difmal Effeds of the Lofs it then receiv ed; At prefent there are not above xoo^V- itmieze both in the Caftle and City. The reft of its Inhabitants are Banyans of all Sorts. There may be about 40000. but few of them of Fortune or Figure, becaufe the Infolence of the Tortugueze makes it unfafe for mo- rey'd Strangers to dwell among them. The King of Tortugal has about nooo Pounds per Annum, of Poll Money paid into his Trea- fury, and the Cuftoms and Land-tax may come to about 6000 Pounds more: But if that Ifland w^ere in the Hands of fome indu- ftrious European Nation, it would be the beft Mart Town on the Coaft of India, for the River Indus being near Neighbours, both by Smdy and Cambay, thofe Commodities might be imported and exported to Advantage, And that Commerce has raifed Stir at.

They are moftly Horfemen, and bold Fellows, who borrow round bums .from the City, by Way of Compulfion, and the Rafjfouts and Coulies make Inroads into this Province,- and plunder even to the Gates of the City, and fometimes have furprifed, and plundred the City itfelf, for which Ne glect the Governors Heads anfwered. In Anno 1716. they were very bold and pre- fumptuous, fo that there was a Stop put to all the Commerce of Amadahant and Cambay. The Governor of Surat got an Army of aoooo to chailife and reftrain them ; but they laid fo many Ambufcades, thar ? in two Months,144 nerw -Account Months, the Army was reduced to lefs than Half of the Number, and the reft were obli ged to get Home, with forrowful Hearts, to Surat. The next Town of Note for Commerce, is Baroach, a walled Town, ftanding on a ri^- fing Ground, on the Banks of the River dab a. Formerly it was a Place of great Trade, but in Aurengzeb\ Wars with his Brothers, about the Year i66o t this Town held out a great While againii his Army. That Seafon proving a dry one, Folks fuffer- ed much for Want of frefh Water and Provi- lions, but at laft he took it, and put all to the Sword that had born Arms againll hjm, and raz'd Part of the Walls, and pronoun ced a Curfe on them that fhould repair them again. But the Sevajees Incurfions made him order the Rebuilding them himfelf, and he chriftned it Suckabant^ or the dry City ; but that new Name could not efface the old one, which it yet retains. It is now inhabit ed by W eavers, and fuch Mechanicks as manu- fatfure Cotton Cloth. And the Baroach Baftas aie famous throughout all Tndia^ the Country producing the bell Cotton in the World. This Town is alfo fubordinate Mo Surat ; and for merly theEngliJh and 'Dutch had Fa&amp;ories fet tled there, but of late have withdrawn them. Surat is the next Sea-port. It was built a- bout the Year 1660. on the Banks of the Ri ver Tapta or Tappee^ which being difcommo- ded with Banks of Sand at Rannier, the then Mart i own on this River, the Engltjh re movedof the Eaft Indies. 1^5 moved about two Miles farther down the River, on the oppofite Side, near a CaftI which had been built many Years before, to fecure the Trade from the Infults of the Malabar Pirates, who ufed to lord it over all the Sea-coatf between Cape' Comer in and Cam- bay. In a little Time after the Engl'tjh had fettled there, others followed their Example, fo that in a few Years it became a large Town, but without Walls, and fo it conti nued till about the aforefaid Year, that Ra jah Sevajee, who had never fubmitted to the Mogul's Domination, came with an Army^ and plundred it, except the European Fafto- ries, who flood on their Guard. Them he complimented with the Profer of his Friend- ihip, becaufe perhaps he apprehended, that he could not plunder them without Blood- ilied and Lofs of Time. However he carri ed away a very great Booty, which made the Inhabitants petition Aurengzeh to fecure them for the futurej by a Wall round their Town^ which Favour he granted, enclofing about 4 Miles to build their City in; but Trade in- creafing, the Town was too fmall within the Walls to contain the People that came about Commerce, wherefore feveral large Suburbs were added to the City for the Con- veniency of Mechanicks. The Wall was built of Brick, about eight Yards high, with round Baftions, 200 Paces diflant from one another, and each had $ or 6 Cannon moun ted on them. And the rich Men of the Town built many Summer-houfes in the' t K Fields*new Account Fields, and planted Gardens about them to folace themfelves and Families in the Heats, which are pretty violent in April, May and June. T he City flourifhed in Trade till Anno 1686. that the Engltjh Company diilurbed its Tranquillity by an unjull; War they made on Surat, but pretended it was not with the Mogtily who had given them many Indulgen ces, which War I'll remark when I treat of Bombay + but that War was ended in Anno 1689. neither to the Profit nor Honour of that Eajt-india Company. In Anno 1695-. Captain Evory a Pirate dillurbed the Trade and Tranquillity of the Town with four fmall Ships, taking one of the Mopiil\ Ships, with a great Booty in'Silver and Gold, and n Ma hometan Lady,, as I obferved before on the Commerce of the Red Sea and the Ifland of Madaaafcar. And fince that Time this City has felt many Convullions in its Trade. In Anno 1705'. when Anrengzeb began to be crazy with old Age, the circumjacent Ra jahs, with an united Force of fourfcore thou- iand Horfe, came and befieged Surat, and plundred all the Villages in the plain Coun try ; but having no Artillery, they could do but little Harm to the City itfelf, bclides llraitriing it a little for Provifions, but the ^V. laying their River and Sea open, that Difficulty was removed by plentiful Supplies brought them from Guzcrat. These Freebooters go under the general Appellation of Gennimsy but they are com- pofedof the Eaft Indies. pofed of the aforementioned tFarrels, Con- lies. Raff outs, Tatanners and Gracias. Thefe Gracias were formerly the landed Men of this Country, and, upon their Submiilion to Ec-* bar, the then Emperor of Moyil, articled to have the Ground Rents paid to them and their Pollerity ; but the Nabobs often defraud them, and they, to put the Governors of Towns and Villages in mind of the Contrail, come in great Numbers, and plunder, or lay them under Contribution. Bur whiHl this rabble Army lay before the Town, the Citizens built Sconces in con venient Places, about half a Mile without the Wall, to proteft the Suburbs, and all thofe Sconces had Cannon mounted on them, which kept the Genmms at a Diftance; and, after the Sconces were finifhed, they built a good high Wall between each Sconce, that encompalled the whole Suburbs, which Wall is about five Miles in Length from the Bank of the River above the Town, to that Part that terminates below the Town; and all the Inclofure is well inhabited. The Inha bitants are computed at 200000 Souls, and amongft them are many very rich, both Ma hometans and Gentiles, AbdulGafour, ^Ma hometan that I was acquainted with, drove a Trade equal to the Englijh Kafl-india Com pany, for I have known him fit out in a Year, above twenty Sail of Ships, between 300 and '00 Tuns, and none of them had lefs of his own Stock than 10000 Pounds, and fome of them had 25000; and, after that foreign Stock ^ K x was148 A new Account was fent away, he behoved to have as much more of an inland Stock for the following Year's Market. When he died, he left his Eftate to two Grandfons, his own Son, who was his only Child, dying before him. But the Court had a Fling at them, and got a- bove a Million SterL of their Ellate. T he Trade of Surat was, and ftill is ve ry confiderable, for, from Anno 1690. to lyof. the Revenues ariling from the Cultom-houfe, Land Rents and Poll Money, commnnibus aunts, came to 1 300000 Rupees, which is Sterl, 1615 -00 L. And the Revenue of Amadabtmt is generally reckoned ten Times as much as Surat. The Cuftoms in the King's Books, are but 2 per Cent, for Mahometans^ and 5* per Cent, for Gentiles. The Land pays three Quarters of its Produft in Corn, and the Poll about a Crown an Head ; but the Rich generally affift the Poor, fome paying fctf 10. fome for 100. and fome for 1000. This Ac count I had from an Officer, called the Vac- can av tec e, who is obliged yearly to take in the Accounts of the Collections, and fend them to Court. Befides the current News that monthly occur in his Diftriel, he fends to the Vizier by PofL The Poft in the Mogiil\ Dominions goes very fwift, for at every Caravanferay, which are built on the High-roads, about ten Miles dillant from one another.

And thofe Curriers are called Dog Chouckies. In the City of Surat there are as ma ny different Religions as in Amfterdam. That by Law eltabli/hed, is Mahometan, of Halts Seft ? and they are called Moors, Then there are Terjians and Tnrks^ and fome called Mujey, who obferve Mofes\ Law as well as the Alcoran, and another Sed: called Mo Lacks, who obferve fome ancient heathnijh Cuftoms and Fealts; but all the others reck on them Hereticks. They have a yearly Feafl, but the Time ofits Celebration is only known to themfelves, wherein, after much Mirth And Jollity, each Sex withdraw to a Room. The Women take each an Handkerchief, ( or fome luch Sign that may be again known) and go in the Dark promifcuoully among the Men, and, without fpeaking, 'ly down together on Mats or Carpets fpread for that Purpofe, and enjoy one another's Company fome Hours, then withdraw to their own Room, leaving their Signals with their Bed fellows, who know whom they have been careffed by; but very often they find ince- fluous Embraces, which at that Feaft are on ly lawful. Aurengzeb made it Death to be found at thofe Meetings, yet that execrable K 3 Rite150 A new Account Rite is ftill continued and praffifed. And Abdul Gafour, the rich Merchant aforemen tioned, was a Difciple of that Se6h The Banyans are moft numerous in this City, and are either Merchants, Bankers, Brokers or Pen-men, as Accountants, Colle- £k)rs and Surveyors, but few or none Handy- crafts, except Taylors and Barbers. They have 8&gt; different Sefts among them, that do not eat with one another. The grcateil Part of the eaftern Religion is in Forms of Wor- fhip, and abftaining from certain Meats; and their Priefls differ as much in thofe Points, and fome others of Dodrine, as Tapifls and 'JProteftants do, for the Brahamans or Bra- mantes are the Priefts of the major Part of thofe Seds, who 1 to leave Legacies to their Church, as fome pi ous Chrijlians do among us, and when they obtain a Legacy, they gratefully acknow ledge the Receit of it, by putting a Scroll of Paper into the dead Perfon's Hand, con taining an Account of the Legacy, with a Bill at the Bottom, to receive ten Times the Va lue in the other World, from fome eminent Saint that deals in fuch Bills of Exchange in Paradife. They have Patriarchs and Bi- fhops to fuperintend the inferior Clergy, who, by Virtue of a divine Right, live fpku- didly and luxuriouily on the Oblations of the People. The other Sefts are taught by the Tola* Joins^ who declaim againft thatpaftftlcalVQ^ are dangeroufly Iity■——— i of the Eaft Indies. 151 lity, and preach up Morality to be the befl Guide to human Life, and affirm, that a good Life in this World, can only recom mend us in the next, to have our Souls tranf- migrated into the Body of fome innocent Beaft, or to reft in Paradife. Their Priefts indeed flievv much Self-de nial, for they live on Alms, and their Tonti- ficalia is a white Sheet that covers their Bo dies, from the Shoulders downwards, a black Staff about 5- Foot long in their Hand, and a fmall earthen Pot, with fome powdered Saf fron and Oyl, to mark thofe on the Fore head that have received their Benediftion that Day. When they go abroad, the old carries a Novice in his Company, to teach him Divinity and Morality by Example. They feldom fpeak in the Streets, but look grave T ]y and demurly, and they extend their Cha rity even to Beafts and Birds. They fuffer their Hair to grow as low as their Shoulders, and have no other Covering on their Heads, and keep their Beards lhaved. A nother Sort of them are Dolors of Phyfick, who pretend to do great Cures by • Amulets, Philtres and Prayers. They have fome Skill in Simples and Minerals, which make them in great Efteem ; but when their Skill in Phyfick produces not the promifed Effeds, then they perfwadc the Patient, that they ly under the Difpleafure of fome angry Deity, who muft be appeafed by Oblations and Penances, which they turn to good Ac count, by ordering the- 'Offerings and Pe- K 4 nancQ15Z A new Account nance to be light; and when that Trick fails, they leave their Patients to work out their own Salvation the beft Way they can. T here is another Sort called Jou^iesy who praftife great Aufterities and Mortifica tions. They contemn worldly Riches, and go naked, except a Bit of Cloth about their Loyns, and fome deny themfelves even that, delighting in Naftinefs and an holy Obfceni- ty, with a great Shew of Sandity. They ne ver cut nor comb their Hair, and befmear their Bodies and Faces with Allies, which makes them look more like Devils than Men 1 have feen a fandified Rafcal of 7 Foot high and his Limbs well proportioned, with a laige Turband of his own Hair wreathed a- bout his Head, and his Body bedawb'd with Ames and Water, fitting quite naked under the Shade of a Tree, with a Tudenda like an Als, and an Hole bored through his Pre- pucc, with a large Gold Ring fixed in the Hole. This Fellow was much revered by Numbers of young married Women, who proitratmg themfelves before the living Tri- and taking him devoutly in their Hands kilt him, whilfthis bawdy Owner ftrokt their lilly Heads, muttering fome filthy Prayers for their Prolification. nT ^ Aufterities of the Jougtes are beyond Belief to thofe who have not been Eye-wit- neflcs of them. Some fland on one Foot lome Years, with their Arms tied to fome Beam of an Houfe, or Branch of a Tree o- vcr t ^ cir Heads, and continue in that Po- ftureof the Eaft Indies. 155 ^ure, except when Nature calls for Exone ration, for others feed them whilft they fland. Their Arms in Time fettle in that Pofture, that ever after they become ufelefs, and are not to be brought again into their natural Pofi- tion. Some lit in the Sun-fliine, with their Fa ces looking upwards, till they are incapable of altering the Pofture of their Necks, their Gul^ let fwelling almoit as thick as their Heads; and they alfo take no Suftenance with their own Hands. Others clinch their Fills, and ty them in thatPofture, till their Finger Nails come through the Back of their Hands. And their Failings are as incredible. I faw a Wo man of about 30 Years of Age, who made a Vow of faffing three Months, to avert fome impending Calamity threatned by Hea ven, that Ihe pretended to forefee. The Go vernor of Sural being a zealous Mahometan^ ( who generally difcourage Gentil'tfm^ and Itrive to deteft their ^ Miracles ) ordered the faid Woman to be put into a Prifon without Windows, without any other Suftenance than fair Water, and to be well guarded by Mahometans, to avoid Impofture. About 80 Days after fhe was imprifoned, I and feveral other Europeans paid her a Vi- fit, and got the Door opened to obferve her Afpert. We found her in Health, but very weak, arid her Pulfe beat very low. Her Keepers declared, that Ihe had taken no Su ftenance, but a very fmall Quantity of Wa ter, all the While they had the Overfeeing of her, nor did ilie ever defire any Food! She154 neew Account She told ns, that three or four Years before, flie had failed fixty Days on the fame Ac count. Y et in Anno 1721. the Governor dete61:- cd a great Piece of Impofture of the Jou~ gies^ who paid pretty dear for their Impu dence. One of thofe fliiy Zealots, who pre tended to more SandHty than his Neighbours, gave out, that he would be buried ( in a Grave 10 Foot deep) alive, and that he would appear at Amadahant^ which is diftant from Surat about 200 Miles, within the Space of 15- Days. The Grave was dug, and he went in, and had fome Reeds placed about a Foot or two Over his Head, to keep the Mould off that was to be thrown over him. There was a large Jar of Water ftanding un der the Shade of a great Tree, about ten or tu elve \ ards from the Grave, where a good ISumber of Jougtes had for fome Time taken l7 P their Quarters, they were Accomplices in the Impofture, and, by their pretended San ctity and great Intercft with Heaven, had gull d many poor People into a Belief of their Story, and many brought Prcfents to them. But the Governor of Surat ordered a Party of Soldiers to fee the Jougie interred, and to jee that no Impoilure fhould be ufed about his pretended Refurredion, and to fearch _• ell, that there Ihould be no fubterraneous Communication between the Gra\ v e and any 1 :acc that might be fufpefted above Ground, accordingly iearching narrowly, theyfu- ;' ctcd lome Place about the Root of the • n Tree,of the Eaft Indies. 155 Tree might afford a PaiTage, ordered the Jougies to remove a little out of their Way, which they did willingly, and, finding no Vifto that might be fufpeded, they ordered the J on pies to remove their great Water Jar, which was near full of Water; but the joimes clamoured loud againlt that Breach of their Privilege, in touching their Water: Lut their Noife made the Mahometuns Sufpi- cion grow flronger, and the Jar was either removed or broken; and behold, where the Jar flood, they difcovered a Mine that reacht within 2, Foot of the Grave, which Cheat being thus detefed, the angry Soldiers fell to Work with their broad Swords, to try if their Sanftity was Proof againlt fharp Steel, but found, by an Experiment of laying a Do zen or more dead on the Ground, and twice as many maim'd with Wounds, that they were as eafily killed or wounded as other honeft 1 oiks. The poor Miracle-monger loll his Head in the Fray. That fpoiled his Journey to and, which was worfe, brought great Scandal on the whole Order. 1 was one Day walking by the Side of a great Tank or Pond near Surat, in Company with an Englijh Lady, and feeing a young Jougy fitting by the Tomb of a celebrated Cutteree, who are a Seel; that bury their dead, the Youth feemed to be very devout in Prayer; but, by the Lady's Order, I in terrupted him, and, asking him why he pray ed there, and to whom did he direft his Prayer, he anfwered that he prayed to God toI $6 A new Account to make him as good a Man as he was who lay interred there. I askt him where God was, at which he feemed to fmile, and askt me, where is he not ? and fo continued a little Space in Prayer, and, when he had done, he took fome Flowers and Grain, with a little Water, and befprinkled the Tomb, and, ma king fome decent Cringings towards the 1 omb, took a formal Leave to go his Way. CHAP. XIV. Is a Continuation of my Ohfervations of the Religions and Cuftoms tifed in Surat and the adjacent Country, TH E great God, whom all adore, they call §hiedaa ; but they have many in- feiioi Deities, and of them Mahadow^ or, as they exprefs it, Maadow, is the fecond in Place and Dignity. Ramm is the third, and Br alma the fourth. And Tarvette is aGod- defs much venerated, and is fuppofed to be the Wife of Maadow. The inferior Deities or Saints are very numerous; but the Ima ges of Gunies, f agar en at ^ Ruftum, Gopalfa- mt are moll worfliipped in their Temples, as i eckoned to have moll Interefl with the fu- perior Deities. 1 he Marriages of the Gentiles in Indian are celebrated with much Pomp. They be gin in the forenoon to fend a long Train of People with covered Dilhes or Baskets on theirof the Eaft Indies. 157 their Heads, with Prefents from the Bride groom to the Bride, and, before the Pre- lent march Hautboys, Drums and Trum pets. After the Prefents march fome female Slaves for the Bride and Bridegroom's Ufe. After the Slaves comes an empty Tallankeen to tranfport the Bride from her Houfe to her Husband's. At Night the Bride and Bride groom are carried in State thro' the Town, with Torch-light and Mufick before them, and Fireworks played offas they pafs in the Streets^ and theParents of the marriedCouple fend Pre fents to their Friends. They have no Choice in their Marriages, for that is left to the Parents or neareft Relations; and they are married before they can be capable either to choofe or refufe, being often married at fix or feven Years of Age; but they do not cohabit be fore the Bride be about ix. and the Bride^ groom 16. As to their Burials, fome burn and fome inter; but Children under 4 Years of Age are all buried. And the Wives are not permitted to burn with their Husbands; but, when once fhe is a Widow, fhe never can marry again, but lives to bewail her Wi dowhood, and perhaps her Virginity, all her Days. They marry but one Wife, except in Ca fes ofBarrennefs or Adultery, tho' there are 110 Laws againil Polygamy. They abhor Buggery and Sodomy, and the Mahometans for that Account, becaufe they ufe them. They eat twice a Day, but the Husband and Wife eat feparate; and they walh before and after158 A new Account after Meat. And the Europeans there fol-' low that cleanly Cullom. 1 The Tar fees are numerous about Surat and the adjacent Countries. They are a J 1 Remnant of the ancient 'Perfians, who ra- I ther choofe to be banilht their Country than ( change their Religion ; for in the feventh * Century of the Chriftian JEra, when Maho- metifm over-ran Terfia, the Spirit of Perfe- J cution came there, and fome 4 or 500 Fami lies were put on board of Shipping, and fent to Sea, without Compafs or Pilot; and they, 1 fleering their Courle Eaftward (in the South- c well Monfoons) from J a fanes, in about 20 | ^ Days, fell in with the Coait of India in the [ Night, and the firft Thing they faw was a Fire afhore, which the Exiles fleered to wards, and accidentally fleered into the Ri- r ver of Nun faree, about feven Leagues to the . Southward of Surat, and were welcomed to \ Land by the Crowing of a Cock. Zoroafter i- was their Founder, and taught them to adore ^ the Sun and Fire, that produced and main- ' ( tained all fublunary Beings. Their feeing the ? Fire on their Approaching the Land, con fir- n mod their Belief, in the Opinion that Ado- } i ration was due to it, for which Reafon they never extinguiih Fire by its oppoflte Ele ment Water; and even if their Houfes are a A burmng, they'll ufe no Water to quench the .r| i lames, but throw Earth or Dull to put it f iof the Eaft Indies. 150 Sea, and were fecure in a River, they will neither kill, nor eat the Flefli of a Cock. W hen they came afliore, the charitable Indians flockt about them, and there being fome among them that could fpeak fome In- diau Languages, related what hard Ufage they had met with in their own Country, and that Providence having directed them to the Indian Country, they begged Leave to fettle among them, and by their Behaviour they would fliew their Gratitude for reliev ing diftrell Strangers, who were then be come their Supplicants, The generous In dians granted their Requelt, and allowed them Land to manure, and Seed to fow the Ground, upon the fame Conditions and Te nure they enjoyed their own Farms: And there they fettled firft, and remain in and a- bout that Country to this Day. They ne ver marry into foreign Families, which makes them retain their native fair Complexion, little inferior to us Europeans^ only their of ten Wafhing and Anointing, which is a Part of the Exercifes of Religion, takes away the beautiful frefli Ruddinefs that adorns ours. Their Rites of Marriage are performed like the other Gentiles, in Oftentation and Ex- pence ; but their Burials are quite different, for they enclofe a fmall Piece of Ground, with a Wall about 4 Yards high, and place feveral Benches for the Corps to fit on, that the four Elements may each have a Share of the Matter their Bodies are compofed. of. The Sun or Fire exhales the \&gt;\xivi &lt;lEJfluvias. TheI do A new Account The Water or Rain carries the putrified Flefli and the Bones to the Earth, that gives Burial to them, and the voracious Fowls car ry what they can pick into the Air in their Maws. They watch the Corps all Day, till one of the Eyes is pickt out. If the Bird be gins with the right Eye, they rejoyce and feaft, but if with the left Eye, they mourn and lament for the ill Fortune of the De- fund's Soul, for they attribute future Happi- nefs to the right Eye, and Mifery to the left. They build thefe Charnel Places far from any Town or Village, left the Stink iliould annoy them. They are very induftrious and diligent in their Vocation, and are bred to Trades and manuring Ground. They are good Carpen ters or Ship-builders, exquifite in the Weav er's Trade and Embroidery^ which may be feen in the rich Atlalfes, Bottadaars and Je* mewaars made by them, as well as fine Ba- roach and Nunfaree Baft as that come from their Manufaftories. They work well in Ivo ry and Agate, and are excellent Cabinet-ma kers. They diftil ftrong Waters^ but that they do clandeftinely, becaufe that Trade is prohibited by the Government they live un der ; yet fome of them get a good Lively- hood by it. The Fields about Surat are all plain, and the Ground very fertil towards the Country, but, towards the Sea, it is fandy and fteril. They have excellent Beef, Mutton and Fowl daily expofed to Sale in the City, reafonably cheap,of the Eaft Indies. 161 theap. Beef is about three Farthings a Pounds when the Bones are kept with the Flefh, and about a Peny with the Bones out. Mutton is about three half Pence, and good large FowJs at feven Pence half Peny apiece. They have fome good Filh, not dear, and Pigeons at a Peny apiece, and live Hares at four Pence apiece. They have Plenty of Wheat, as good as any in Europe, and fome Peafe, and French Beans; but neither Oats nor Barley. They have feveral Species of Legumen; but thofd of T)oll are moll in ufe, for fome Doll and Rice being mingled together and boyled* make Kitcheree^ the common Food of the Country. They eat it with Butter and At- char or Salt-fifth 'Tis a pleafant nourifliing Food, and that which the famous Auren^ zeb moft delighted to eat. They have alio Store of wild Fowl i but who have a Mind to eat of them^ muft fhoot them. Flamin goes are large, and good Meat. The Paddy- bird is alfo good in their Seafon, and the Corn-bird is excellent in theirs. They have good Partridge, but bad Pheafants. Their wild Geefe, Duck and Teal are plenty and good ; and feveral Sorts of Turtledoves, both beautiful and well tailed. They have few Deer, but great Plenty of Antelopes in their Forefts. There are no fine Buildings in the City, but many large Houfes^ and fome Caravanferays and Mufcheits, and fome fine Tants, or large Cifterns to keep Rail* Water, near the Town, particularly one ^ t iitttel6l A new Account little without Bramfore Gate. The French have a little Church near the old Englijh Fa- ftory, which maintains a few Capuchins, who pradife Surgery gratis to the poor Natives, of what Perfwalion foever. They make fome Converts; but they are generally of the loof- eit Morals of any Set in the Town; There are above an hundred different Seds in this City; but they never have any hot Difputes about their Doftrine or W ay ofWorfhip. Er very one is free to ferve and vvorlliip God their own Way. And Perfecutions for Reli. gion's fake are not known among them. The Mahometans have the Law in their Hands, and diftribute Juftice belt to thofe that pay belt for it. The Judge's Fees are 25' per Cent. on all Sums that he pronounces due to the Party whofe Plea is belt fupported with Bribes or Intereft, for the Jultice of a Caufe feldom prevails. Many Examples I have feert between honelt Men of low Fortunes and Villains clothed w 7 ith publick Characters and good Fortunes ; yet in fome Cafes I have fcen Juftice take Place. The Englijh and ^Dutch Directors or Agents there make good Figures, becaule the Officers of State and Ju-' Itice get yearly Prefents or Penfions from them. The Governor of the Caitle is not fuborditiate to him of the Town, and he dares not come out of his Nelt but once in a Year, that he is permitted to go to Church, and then he mult return before Sun-fet. None are fuffered to pafs the River whilit the Sun is down below the Horizon, nor dares any oneof the Eaft Indies. i6% one that comes in Boats put their Foot a- Ihore without a fpecial PermiiTion; and all Boats or VefTels muft land at the Cuftom- houfe, and the Boat and Men are narrowly fearcht. The Cxxftoms on Mahometans Goo&amp;s are two in the hundred, on Chriftians thrfee and three Quarters; but the Qhriftiani are exempt from paying Poll-money, but the Ma* hornet an s are not) nor Gentows, who pay f per Cent. Cuftoms on their Goods. The Ba* nyans are Brokers even to Mahometans^ whd cannot well make Bargains without their Brokers. The MahometanWomzn go alwaysVail'd when they appear abroad. Their Garments differ but little from the Man's. Their Coats^ which alfo ferve both Sexes for Shirts^ are: clofe bodied. The Mens are gathered iii Plats below the Navel, to make them feeiii long waifted, and the Womens are gathered a pretty Way above, to make their Waift feem ihort. 'They both wear Breeches td the Ancle. The Men wear only Silver Rings on their Fingers, and generally but one fof a Signet. The Women wear Gold Rings oft their Fingers, and {pmetimes one on their Thumbs, with a fmall Looking-glafs fetin it^ and often they wear Gold Rings in their No- fes and Ears. The Gentiles again permit their Women to appear bare-faced, and their Legs bare to the Knee. They wear Gold or Silver Rings, according to their Ability^ one in their Nofe, and feveral fmall ones in Holes bored round the Rim of the Ear, I L a ^l6\ A new Account .with one large and heavy in each Lappet. They wear alfo Rings on their Toes, and Shekels on their Legs, of the aforefaid Me- taki made hollow, and fome Glafs Beads loofe in them, that when they move the Leg they make a Noife like a rattle Snake. The Men wear Gold, Rings in their Ears, and often three or four in a Clufter, hanging at the Lappet. Some have a Pearl fet in them. The Mahometan Men are known by their Garb, tho' the Gentows and theirs are of one Make, fave only as they are all overlapt on the Breaft. The Mahometans are tied on the left Side, which, among them, is the Side of Honour, and the Gentiles tie theirs on the right Side. The Mahometan Tur- bands are likewife of another Drefs or Make than the Heathens ; and the different Seds of the Heathens are known by the Figure of their Turbands. ? W hen the Englijh firft fettled a Com merce in this Country, which was about the Beginning of the lixteenth Century, they were held in great Elteem; but the Porta- gueze pretending a Right to that Trade fole- ly, diiturbed the En^L'tjh in theirs, murder ing their People, and making Prize of all Ships and Veilels they could overcome. One Seafon the Englijh had eight good large Ships riding at Swally, which is about ten Miles from Ranier, where the Prefident and his Council then refided; and Swally was the Place where all Goods w 7 ere unladed from the Shipping, and all Goods for Exportation w 7 ereof the Eaft Indies. 16$ were there fhipp d off- The c Portu^ueze ^ thinking it a fit Time to give a deadly Blpwi to the Commerce, came with a Fleet - of 6 large Ships, 10 fmall, and 10 or ix half Gallies, and anchored to the Northward of the Englijh, in a narrow Chanel, not Muf- ket-lliot wide, and a Tide generally of 6 or 7 Miles an Hour. The Tortugue&amp;e landed near 3000 Men, and feized fome Carts laden with the Company's Goods, The Engl'tjh could not bear the Infults they daily receiv ed, held a Council, wherein it was refolved to land 800 Men out of the Ships, and at tack the Tortugueze, while they were lulled in Security of their own Strength and Num bers, and if they were overpowered, that thofe left on board the Englijh fliould try if they could cut a Tortngueze Ship's Cables that lay near them, and lier driving on board, of another, might, with the Force of the Tide, put them all a-ground on the Shore, or a Sand Bank that they lay very near to. Accordingly, by Break of Day, the Englifly were all landed, and every Ship's Crew led by their own Commander. As they had conjedured, fo it fell out, the Englijh were among the Tortuqueze before they could get in a Votlure of Defence, and put them in Confufion. Thofe on board had done as they were ordered, one being cut loofe, foon made all the refl run a-ground, and molt of them loft, efpecially the great Ships. The little Englijh Army purfued the Tortugueze, and killed many in their Flight; but at « L 3 Pointl6d A hew Account Point of Land, about three Miles from the Ships, the Tortugueze made a Stand, and ral lied ; but the little vidorious Army foon made them, take a fecond Time to their Heels, and fo the Englijh got an intire Victory, with fmall Lofs, for there were not twenty killed on the Englijh Side, but above i^oo of the Tortuguexe, In Anno 1690. 1 was on the Field of Battle, and faw many human Sculls aind Bones lying above Ground.

Cha Jehan was one of the mod polite Kings that ever ruled over that great Empire of Mogulfian, He was a great Patron to all skil ful Perfons in Arts and'Sciences, and gave gr^at Encouragement to Foreigners to come tq his Court, treating them kindly and fami liarly, and allowed them handfom Penfions |o live on, and often fent for the mofl po-tf the Eaffc Indies. 167 lite of them, and difcourfed them about the Cuftoms, Laws, Commerce and Strength ot the European Nations, and what he found valuable amongil them, he would fain have brought into his own Dominions r forry to fee the moll beautiful Pait of thd Creation caged up in Setc&amp;lt&amp;Sy bied up in Ignorance, and kept from ufeful and Converfation, by the heavy tetters of blind and unreafonable Cuflom. He turned his Thoughts to break thofe lordid Chains, and introduce the Ladies to a free Air, and leck- oned his Court, which he then kept at Agra a great City, to be the mofl proper Part tor the Stage to aft it firft upon. T he firit Step he took, was to order ali the Ladies at Court to provide precious Stones to bring to a Marketplace that he had ele cted, and there to Ihew their Wares publiek- ly to all the Noblemen at Court, who were ordered to buy them at whatever Pricesthe Ladies put upon them; and the King him- felf was to be a Buyer, to put the g 16 ^ 01 Honour on the new erected Market. 1 he Ladies obeyed, and took their Booths as tKy thought fit. On the Market Day the King and Noblemen came to Market, and bought the Jewels and other Trifles the Ladic^ nad to difpofe of. T he King coming to the Bootn of a very pretty Lady, askt what Ihe had to icll. told him, ihe had one large fine rough Dia mond flill to difpofe on. He defired to fee it, and he found it to be a Piece of fine tran L 4 fparentI &lt;58 A new Account fparent Sugar-candy, of a tolerable good Di- amond Figure. He demanded to know uhat Price fhe fet on it, and fhe told him with a pleafant Air, that it was worth a Lack o Rupees, or 11500 L, Sterl. He ordered the Money to be paid, and, falling in Dif. courfe with her, found her Wit was as ex- qumre as her Beauty, and ordered her tofup ^ v j lat: ^ 1 * s Palace.

I d9 jefly did not think fit he Ihould live, A Friend of his, who was an Officer of the Guards, ordered the Meflengers of Death to flop aWhile, till he had acquainted the King with the Requeft, which was accordingly done, and he was ordered to be carried in to the Court of the Palace, that the King might hear what he had to fay, and, being carried thither, his Majefty demanded what he would have. He anfwered, that what he had faid to his Wife, was the greateft Ho nour that he was capable to do his King, who, after he had honoured his Wife with his Embraces, thought himfelf unworthy ever after to cohabit with her. The King, pau- fing a little, ordered him to be unbound, and brought to his own Room, where, aflbon as he came, the King embraced him, and orde red a Serpaw or a royal Suit to be put upon him, and gave him the Command of ^ooo Horfe more, but took his Wife into his own Harran or Seraglio, and, about nine Months after, the famous Aurengzeb came into the World. How long the Charter held for continuing thofe Markets, I know not, but it feems Cha J eh an grew fonder of this Lady than of any he had before, tho' he had three Sons by them, the eldell of vvhofe Names I have forgot. Aurengzeb was brought up and educated by his Mother, till he was about i - l Years of Age, and then he had Priefts and Philofophers to inftrufl' him. Cha Jehan finding his Empire too large, defigned to divide it an^ongit his Sons, and fqlyo A new A fo placed his eldefl Son in the nothern Pro vinces of Candabaar and Uzbeck, to fuper- intend there, and make him acquainted with ihofe People and their Gufloms, that he de- figned flioald be his Sabjefts. The fecond Son Morad Bucks he fent to 'Decan, to go vern there. The third Sultan Sujah he fent to Bengal) to govern that Country; and An- rengzeb he defigned for Guzerat, being a fmall Province in Comparifon of the others: But when Aurengzeb came to be about eigh teen Years of Age, and had done with the School, he'difTembled his ambitious Thoughts, and declared that he defired to live a private Life in the Province allotted him, and fo took up the Fakire Habit and Way of Life, contemning the Honours and Riches of the World, and zealoufly kept' the canonical Hours of Prayer, which, by the Alcoran, is five Times a Day. In this Thar 'tfatcal W ay he fpent eight or ten Years, till his Father began to be old and weak; and News being fpread abroad that he was fick, the eldell Son began to raife an Army in his Province, to march towards Agra, in order to feize the Crown on his Father's Demife. Morad Bucks knowing the cruel Cuflom of his Country, which is either to die, or be fent to an Hill near Agra, called Gouiour, and there drink the Toujly ( which is an Infufion of Poppy Seeds in Water, that provokes Sleep) and fpend his Days in a Lethargy; but, to avoid both, he alfo raifed a good Army in his Pro vince, and marched alio towards Agra, andof the Eaft Indies. lyt Sultan Sujah raifed one in Bengal, but kept within his own Province, Aurengzeb conti nued in his Retirement and holy Exercifes, and neither difturbed his Father's Repofe, as the reft had done, nor was Tufpefted by his Brothers to have any Defign to rule. Au rengzeb had a Sifter, called Neur Mahaal, that was continually about her Father Cha Jehan, and he had a great Efteem for her, as fhe had for Aurengzeb ; and as fhe was a Woman of a great Genius and Vivacity, fhe fiflit out all the Defigns of her Father and Brothers, and acquainted Aurengzeb with them by Let ters, and promifed her Afliftance to fet him on the Throne. - Cha Jehan fent Letters to his Sons, who were in Arms, to disband their Forces, up on their Allegiance, but not one obeyed, al- ledging, that they kept in Arms for their own Security in cafe of his Death. The two eldeft made daily Approaches towards Agra:, and Aurengzeb raifea a fmall but good Army, pretending it was to keep the Peace of his own Province. However, as Morad Bucks was on his March towards Agra, he was obliged to pafs through fome ^art of Aurengzeb's Territories, and they had an In terview, and agreed, that if the eldefl Son would not be advifed to retire back with his Army to his own Province, but continue difobedient to their Father's Commands, then Aurengzeb would joyn Morad Bucks, and compel him by Force ; but flill Aurengzeb preacht up Peace and Contempt of world- H1*71 new Account ly Grandeur. They wrote prellingly to their elder Brother, to honour their Father's Com mands, but to no Purpofe ; fo Aurengzeh marched his Army always near Morad Bucks $ i to meet their eldefl Brother, and found him encampt on the Banks of the River Gemna^ and, on the oppofite Banks Morad Bucks encampt his Men. Aurengzeb went to wait on his elder Brother as a Mediator, but in reality to difcover what Condition his Ar- 1 my was in. His Brother received him with all the Marks of Elleem, and, after a long Conference, he invited Aurengzeb to joyn Forces with him, and that allbon as he came to the Crown, he would make him and his Heirs free Sovereigns of Guzerat. Aureng- z&gt;eb anfwered, that as for his own Part, he had rather live a Subjeft than a Sovereign, whofe Care about Government difturbed the Mind, and rendred it unfit for fweet Con templation, and he only brought his Army there to joyn him who inclined moll to Peace, which he found his Brother Morad Bucks averfe to, but that he would joyn nei ther till the lait Extremity ; and, on his Re turn, he went to Morad, and told him, that his eldell Brother's Army was much inferior to theirs, and advifed him to put all to the {•ortune of a Battle, that he would (land at a little Di&amp;mce neuter, till the Battle began, and then would fall on the Enemy's Flank and Rear with his Army, which accordingly he did, when his eldeft Brother had no Su- Ipicion of fuch Ufage. The Battle was fhort, butof the Eaft Indies. 175 but bloody, and the eldeft Brother was kib led, which the Remnant of his Army feeing, begged for Quarter, and had it, and lilled into the Conquerors Armies. The Vidory was wholly imputed to Aurengzeb s Conduit, by all the three Armies, which was a great Mortification to Morad Bucks^ who expell ed that Honour. But Aurengzeb had ano ther Game to play whilft the Armies were fo much at his Devotion, for his Brother Morad Bucks was violently inclined to the Love of Wine, tho' forbidden by their Laws. jduvengxeh got fome of his own Creatuies ot the bell Rank, to procure Wine and carouze with him, which they did, and he got beatf- ly drunk, and vomited on the fine Caipcts he lay on. While he was in that Pickle, j4.u ~ rengzeb came to his Tent with his Gruard^ and demanded prefent Admittance, for there were News brought of the greateft Impor tance, which he mufi:, without Delay, com municate to his Brother, and ftepping haftily into the Tent, his Guards following him, he found his Brother in the Condition he wiflit for, and calling him feveral Times by his Name, he was not able to anfwer, wherefore Aurengzeby out of an holy TLeal to Religion, vented many angry Words againlt the Bead his Brother, and then, in a fandified Choler, ordered one of his Guards to ftrike ofl his Head, which was forthwith executed. The News of the Fratricide flew like wild Hre through the Armies, but Aurengzeb\ being in Arms foon calm'd thofe that had a Mind to174 A new Account to raife Troubles, and, in the Morning, made an Oration that pleafed the Armies lb well, that they fwore Obedience to his Commands. The Clergy run his Praifes as high as their Prophet's Paradife, commending his godly Piety and Zeal for poor diftrelled Religion, and, no Doubt, would have done the fame for the Drunkard, had he been as politick as Aurengzeb, who is now faluted c PautJhaWy or Emperor, by the Army, notwithftanding his Father was then alive. Cba Jehan having loft two of his Sons, ex- pefted that all his Troubles were now en ded, fent to Aurengzeb to come to him, and ■coniult about fettling the Peace of his Coun try, which had been fo long difturbed by civil Wars, but Aurengzeb would not truft himfelf within the Walls of aCity^ where he had not the Command in his own Handsj but wrote very fubmiftive Letters to his Fa ther, and advifed him to lay down the heavy Charge of Government on his Shoulders who was young, and much better able to manage it than a Man whofe Age required Reft, and gave Orders to build an high Wall round the Palace, and placed his own Crea-» tures to guard the Palace, which fo vext the old King, that he ordered all the Jewels of the Crown to be broken, and particularly his Throne, which he himfelf had caufed to be made worth above a Million Sterlings but none durft obey him. And Near ATa- haal, who had given her Brother Aureng zeb private Informations of her Father's De- %n$of the Eaft Indies. - 175 figns all the Time of the Rupture, adverts fed him of the old Man's Defign in that Af fair, and cautioned him to take Care of what Meat and Drink he took, and to fend an Army into Bengal, to reduce Sultan Sujah % who was invited by the old King, to come with his Army to Jlgra. Aurengzeb durft not leave that Country where his Father was well beloved^ for Fear of a Revolution in his Aliairs, but fent an Army under the Com mand of a trufty General, called Emirjemal who, in three Years Time, chafed J///- tan Sujah out of the Dominions of Bengal, and ChtL Jehm then dying, brought a ferene Peace throughout the whole Empire. rengzeb remembring his Sifter's Services, made her Governefs of the Palace, and re tained her always near his Perfon, and would eat nothing but what came from her Hand. • Being now fettled in Peace, he invited his holy Brethren the Fakires, who are ve ry numerous in India, to come to Agra, and receive a new Suit of Clothes, as a Teltimo- ny of his Kindnefs for them. Great Num bers came on the Invitation, and he pitched Tents in many Places round the City to en tertain them, and he proclaimed, that on a certain Day the Dillribution fliould be made^ and appointed Officers in every Tent to de*' liver the new Clothes, but to retain the old Rags in their Rooms, which Stratagem brought many Millions into hisTreafury, for thofe pretended Saints having good Store of Diamonds and Gold fewed up in their Rags, werevj6 . A new Account were forced to leave all behind them. Hd then bent his Thoughts on enlarging his Do minions, and quarrelled with the King of O- rixa near Bengal^ and with the King of Vi~ f&amp;pore near 'Decan, and, in ten Years, he an- next their Dominions to his own large Em pire. And fo I leave him to take his Pieafure till the Year 1707. that he died in his Tent near Agra^ and lies buried in a fmall Tomb of feven Foot long and three high, on the Side of an High-way that leads to that City. He was a Prince every Way qualified for governing. None ever underftood Politicks better than he. The Balance of diftributive Jultice he held in an zy&amp;di ^Equilibrium. He was brave and cunning in War, and merci ful and magnanimous in Peace, temperate in his Diet and Recreations, and modeit and grave in his Apparel, courteous in his Beha viour to his Subjeds, and affable in his Dif- courfe. He encouraged Virtue, and dif- countenanced Vice, and he fludied the Laws of Humanity, and obferved them as well as thofe of Religion, for in that Part he incli ned to Superllition. He had five Sons, but three only made any Figure. The eldeft was ^Dara^ or vulgarly Hazan Tarahy the fecond Shaw Allorri) the third Furuckfier-, the fourth Eckbar, and the fifth Shaw Hazunder. The three firft contended for the Crown after their Father's Death, but Sbww Allom carri ed it. From Snrat to ^Damaan, a Town belong ing to the Crown of Tortugaly and at zx Lea- guesof the Eaft Indies. gucs Difknce, are feveral Rivers and Mila ges, under the Superintendency of Surat. ^Dumbafs is the firll, hut of fmall Confequence, either in Trade or Manufaftory. Nun far ee is the fecond, that has a good Manufadory of Cotton Cloth, both coarfe and fine. Gun- davee is next, where good Quantities of Teak Timber are cut, and exported, being of excellent Ufe in building of Houfes or Ships. Seragoung is a River of no other Con fequence but limiting the Mogul's Domini ons on the Sea Side, as well as the Tortu- gueze Territories. It is dilbnt from Q Damaan about 4 Miles. CHAP. XVI. Treats of the Cities and Towns on the Sea- coafi, belonging to the Crown ^/'Portugal, from Damaan to Bombay. Da m a a n was, in former Times, a Place of good Trade, but at prefent reduced to Poverty. It ftands at the Mouth of a River on the Sea-fhore, and is naturally very ftrong, by a deep Maiili that almolt furrounds it. The Town is about half a Mile long, and near as broad, walled with a good Stone Wall, as the reft of the Build ings of the City are built of; and it has a large Cathedral to adorn it, that is confpicuous a long Way at Sea. There are two or three other Churches, and a Convent, a Monaflery, t M axyS A new Account a Nunnery, and an Hofpital, and there is a Caft]e ftands on the oppollte Side of the Ri ver, chriftned by the Name of St. Salva* dore, and it is well fecured by the Morafs, as well as the Town. It has been for a long I ime a great Eye-fore to the Governors of Suraty who have often pickt Quarrels with the Tortugneze^ and laid Siege to ^Damaafty but without Sueeefs. From 'Damaan to Baffatm is about 18 Leagues along the Sea-lliore. There are fe- veral Rivers and Villages by the Way, viz. *J}ana~Ju, Tarrapore^ Mahim, KelLem, and the Ifland Vaccas, but they are all of fmall Ac count in the Table of Trade. Baffaim is a fortified City belonging to the Crown of Tortugal. It {lands on a little I- iland, feparted from the Continent byafmall Rivulet. Its Walls are pretty high, and a- bout two Miles in Circumference around the City, which has a little Citadel in the Middle of it. It contains three or four Churches, and fome Convents and Monafteries, with a Col lege and Hofpital, It is a Place of fmall Trade, becaufe moft of its Riches ly dead and buried in their Churches, or in the Hands of indolent lazy Country Gentlemen, who loiter away their Days in Eafe, Luxury and Pride, without having the leall Senfe of the Poverty and Ca lamity of their Country. The Town is a- bout half a League diflant from the Illand of which Inlet ferves 5 it for an Harbour for fmall Shippings but there is not Water enoughof the Eaft Indies. enough to accommodate great Ships. The Go vernor is ftiled, by the 'Tortuguezey General t)f the North, having 'Z)///, Tiamaan and Chaul y with all their Territories, fubordinate to him, but the Church fuperintends, which makes his Government both uneafy and precarious. Salfet is an Ifland about 15- Miles longj and, in fome Places, 10 Miles broad. It is fruitful in Roots and Fruits, but not in Corn. It is ftockt with Villages and Churches, but has no City on it, but an old one, called Canra^ hewn out of the Side of a Rock, but by whom I never could learn. It is near a Mile in Length, and many antique Figures and Columns curiouily carved in the Rock, and has feveralgood Springs of Water to ac commodate it. Atprefent it is inhabited only with wild Beafts, and Birds of Prey. The Illand is almoft cut in two by a narrow Ri ver that bifeds it at a Town called Verfua^ which lies on the Sea-lhore, and has a little narrow Harbour, deep enough to receive Ships of the greatefl Burden, and is fecured by a fmall Fort (landing on the North Side^ but the Town is on the South Side of the River. It drives a fmall Trade in dry Fifh* made here, and tranfported to the inland Countries and Villages, that want the Bene fit of Fifhing. The Fifhers here catch their Fifli in long Nets, faftned to Stakes placed in the Sea, the outwardmoft of which are driven in the Bottom on nine Fathoms Water ; and they appear to Strangers like a Wood in the Sea. There are feveral Villages ftanding be- | M 2- tweenj8o A new tween Verfua and Bombayi on the Sca-fliore, but Bandar a is the moil confpicuous, which fronts Mah'tm on Bombay, about a Mile di- flant. The Tortugueze have fome great Guns planted at Bandara, but they have no Trade, becaufe the River belongs to the Englijh ; and all Cuftoms of Goods, either imported or exported, are paid to the Cu- fiom-houfe of Mahim. The Mouth of the River is peiler'd with Rocks, that forbid En trance to any VefTels of Burden. In Anno 1694. the Muskat Arabs made a Defcent on Saljet, and committed great De predations in plundring and burning Villa ges and Churches, killing the Psieils, and carried about 1400 Captives into irredeem able Slavery. And about the Year 1710. the Priefts of Salfet diihirbed the Engl'tjh at Ma- him, animating the People to Arms; but a Bomb or two thrown into the Church at Bandar a, had no Refpeft to the Priefthood, but facrilegioufly killed one or two, befides fome Lay Brothers, which made them -know that War was not their Trade, They were alfo troublefom to the En git J!) in Anno 1712, but the Englijh furprifed a Parcel that were about repairing an old Fort, contrary to Ar- .tides of Agreement, and killed a Score or two,'which made the reft take to their Heels, and be quiet.

Gives a Defcription of Bombay, with fame hi ft or teal Remarks on its JVars, Govern- went and Trade^ till Anno 1687. r &amp;hen the Foundation of a War was laid, which pro ved the Ruin o f the then Englilli Eaft-india Company, \^OMBAT comes next in Courfe, an Illand belonging to the Crown of England. It was a Part of Katharine of 'P or- tugal\ Portion, when flie was married to Charles 11. of Great Britain, in Anno j 66 i . Its Ground is fteril, and not to be improved. It has but little good Water on it, and the Air isfomewhat unhealthful, which is chiefly imputed to their dunging their Cocoa-nut Trees with Buckjhoe^ a Sort of fmall Hfh- es which their Sea abounds in. They being laid to the Roots of the Trees, putrify, and caufe a moll unfavoury Smell ; and in the Mornings there is generally feen a thick Fog among thofe Trees, that affefts both the Brains and Lungs of Europeans^ and breccl Confumptions, Severs, and Fluxes. After the Marriage, King Charles fent my Lord Malberry, with four or five Ships of War, to take PolielTion of it, and- the King of ^Portugal fent a Vice-roy to de liver it, and all its Royalties, to the faid Lord, and Sir Abraham Shipman was ordered to be Governor for King Charles. They arrived at Bombay in September^ 1663. but the Church M 3 with-j St A new Account withflood the Crown, and difobeyed the Or der : Nor would they acknowledge the Vice roy, unlefs he would come into their Mea- fures, which, rather than lofe his new Digni ty, he did. And the Englijh Fleet was for ced to go to Swally to land their Men, and get Refrefhments; but the Governor of Su- rat) in whofe Diftrift Swally is, grew jea lous of the Numbers and Bravery of the En- glijh) and threatned the Fadory eltabliflied in Stir at i if they did not fpeedily re-imbark, which, to avoid Sufpicion, they did, and the Governor allowed them the free Ufe of the Markets, fo that they had no Want of Pro- vifions and Merchandize whilft they flayed there. In January 1664. my Lord went back to Enpjand^ carrying two Ships with him, and left Sir Abraham with the reft, to pafs the wefterly Monfoons, in fome Port on the Coaft, but being unacquainted, chofe a defo- late Ifland, called Aujadiva, to winter at. Ft is fo far from an Harbour, that it is even but a bad Road for Shipping in thofe boiftrous South-weft Winds and turbulent Sea ; how ever he landed all the Land-forces, and built Huts to defend them from the Weather. The Ifland is barren, but has fome Springs of good Water. It is about a Mile long, and 300 Paces broad. Here they ftayed from A- jpril to October^ in which Time they buried ^bove 2co of their Men. W hen the Monfoons were over, the Squa dron put to Sea, and put in to Bombay, to try if the Church had confidered on the O- bedienceof the Eaft Indies. 185 bedience due to the King of 'P orfugal s Or ders, or if they had a Mind to draw the Arms of England^ as well as their Sovereign s, upon them. Some of them had not forgot what Damages Spain and 'Portugal lu- ftained by the Engltjh Heet in Cromdbel's Time, advifed the Church to obey the King, fetting forth the Miferies they fliould be brought into in cafe of Noncompliance. At length their holy Zeal abated, and they were content to admit of a Treaty, but, before the Treaty was concluded, Sir Abraham dazd., and one Mr. Humphrey Cook, who was next in Commiflion, continued the Treaty, and articled, that* the Inhabifants fhould enjoy their Lands and Religion under the King ot England^ but forgot to infert the Royalties appending on Bombay, which reacht as flu* as Verfua on Salfet, which Omiffion has been a Bone of Contention for both Parties ever lince. M r. Cook, according to the Treaty, took PoflTeflion of the Illand, in the King's Name, and forthwith began to fortify regularly, and, to fave Charges of building an Houfe for the Governor, built a Fort round an old fquare Houfe, which ferved the Tortugueze for a Place of Retreat, when they were di- llurbed by their Enemies, till Forces could be fent from other Places to relieve them. After the Fort was lined out, and^ the Foundations laid, Sir Gervas Lucas arrived from England with two Ships, but Affairs be ing fettled before he came, did not ftav at M 4 Bom*155 4 A new Bombay longer than January 1666. and left the Government of the Ifland in the Hands of Mr, Cook and his Council, the Prefidency for the then Company, refiding at Surat, Their Trade flouriflied, and increafed won derfully ; but, after the Fort was finifhed, the King finding, that the Charge of keep ing Bombay in his own Hands would not turn to account, the Revenues being fo ve ry inconfiderable, he made it over to the Eaft-indta Company in Fee Tail, which con tinues fo till this Time. In building the Fort where it is, Mr. Cook fhewed his Want of Skill in Architedure, where a proper and convenient Situation ought to be well confidered, for it is built on a Point of Rocks that jets into the Sea, where there are no Springs of frelh Water, and it ftands within 800 Paces of an Hill, cal led Tiungercey that overlooks it, and an Enc- my might much incommode it from that Hill, as we found by Experience in Anno 1689. when the Mopid fent an Army on Bom* hay. As for the Magnitude, Figure and Ma terials of the Fort, there is no Fault to be i? n ? m them, for it is a regular Tetragon, whole outward Polygon is about ^00 Paces, and it is built of a good hard Stone, and it can mount above 100 Piece of Cannon; and that is all that is commendable in it: But had been built about 500 Paces more to the oouthwnrd, on a more acute Point of Rocks, called ^ Jcndbam's, Point, it had been much petter pn feveral Accounts. Firft, it had been muchof the Eaft Indies. 185 much nearer the Road for proteding the Shipping there, it had been farther oti c Dun~ geree Hill, it would have had a Spring of pretty good Water, which ferved the Ho- fpital that was afterwards built there, and the Shipping had been better fecured that lay in the little Bay between the Point where the Fort now Hands, and Mcndhams Point. They went about building feveral other little Forts and Sconces in convenient Places, to hinder an Invafion, if any of their Neigh bours Ihould have attempted one. At Ma- zagun there was one, at Souree one, at Sian one, at Mahim one, and JVorlee had one, and fome great Guns mounted on each of them. Notwithftanding the Company was at fo much Charge in building of Forts, they had no Thoughts of building a Church, for many Years after Sir George Oxendon began to build one, and charitable Colledions were gathered for that Ufe; but when Sir George died. Piety grew fick, and the Building of Churches was grown unfafhionable. Indeed it was a long While before the Illand had People enough to fill a Chapel that was in the Fort, for as fall as Recruits came from Britain, they died in Bombay, which got the Illand a bad Name. T here w 7 ere reckoned above ^ooo L. had been gathered towards building the Church, but Sir John Child, when he came to reign in Bombay, converted the Money to his own Ufe, and never more was heard of it. The Walls were built by his Predecef-18^ A new Account fors to five Yards high, and fo it continued till the Year 1715'. that Mr. Boone came to the Chair, who fet about building it, and, in five Years Time, finiflied it by his own Be nevolence, and other Gentlemen, who, by his Perfwafions, were brought in to contri bute. The Company alfo contributed fome- thing towards that pious End. A bout the Y ear 1674. Pi'efident Aungier r a Gentleman well qualified for Governing, came to the Chair, and, leaving Surat to the Management of Deputies, came to Bombay, and rectified many Things that. were amifs, and brought the Face of Juftice to be unvai- led, which before lay hid in a fingle Perfon's Breait, who diftributed her Favours accord ing to the Governor's Direftion. He erect ed a formal Court, where Pleas were brought in and debated; but that Method lafted but a few Y ears, when Sir J o/m Child came to the Chair the Court was done, Mr. Aungier ad- vifed the Company to enclofe the Town from nngeree to Mendhams Point, for fe- curing the trading People from the Infults of their troublefom beggarly Neighbours on the Continent; but his Propofals were rejefted, and that neceiTary Piece of Work was refer- ycd for Mr. Boone alfo. And happy it was for the Inhabitants that the Town was fecu- rcd by a* Wall, otherwife Connajee Augarte would have harafTed them with continual In fults fmce his War with the Engltjh began. i he Name of Mr. Aungier is much re vered by the ancient People of Surat and Bombayof the Eaft Indies. 187 Bombay to this Day. His Juftice and Dexte rity in managing Affairs, got him fuch Efteem, that the Natives of thole Places made him the common Arbitrator of their Differences in Point ofTraffick : Nor was it ever known that any Party receded ever from his Award. There are no Dangers in going into Bombay Road, but one funk Rock that lies about half a League from the Caftle. It is dry at low Water, and has a Chanel within it deep enough for the greateft Ships to pafs. I never heard of any Damage done by that Rock, but to a fmall Ship called the Baden, which, by Carelefnefs, run on it at Noonday, and was loft. I n the Year 1673. the 'Dutch Eaji-india Company having an Eye on Bombay, fent a Squadron of Ships, with a little Army, to try if they could take it in amongft their o- tlier Conquefts of India, but, on their land ing, met with fo warm a Reception, that they were glad to get off with the Lofs of ^ or 300 of their Men, and fo left the Euqltfh to the quiet PoffefTion of it. The Governors proved tolerable good till 1682,. that Sir John Child {poik it. The India Company knowing how to make ufe of King Charles 's Neceftities, made himfome Prefents of Money, and he, in grateful Ac knowledgments, granted them Power to rob their fellow Subjects in India ; but they ufed that Power to their own Deftrudion, for Mr. Child's Pride and Opprcflions grew fo intolerable, that even the Gentlemen in the Conn188 A new Account Company's Service had not the free Exercife of T rade, and much lefs private Merchants. And he, trampling on the ellablifhed Laws of England, by Advice of his Namefake who governed the Company in Europe, by impri- foning and murdering their fellow Subjects, grew hateful to all. In Anno 1684. he made his Brother in Law Mr. JVard his Deputy of Bombay, who deiig- ned to fifli in troubled Waters. Mr. Child being honoured with the Title of Baronet, by the powerful Motive of the Company's Money to the King, he, at the fame Time, ot the Commiifion of General, which pufc im up fo, that he contemned all Laws hu man and divine. The military Gentlemen, who had made Contracts in England for their Salaries, tho' paid at 20 per Cent. Lofs, yet to ihew himfell: a good Oeconomilt for his Mailer s Interefts, lent his Deputy Orders to reduce their Pay to 30 per Cent, lefs than it was before, tho* it was fo fmall, that they could hardly bring both Ends to bear at the Month's End. That hard Pill the Sons of Mars could not fwallow, and fo bent their Minds on a devolution 1 And having come to fome Knowledge of Mr. Ward's tampering with the Sevajee to land on the liland, they deteded fome Letters of his to that Purpofe, which gave them a Ground for a Revolt. 1 he Sevajee indeed fent a Fleet of 80 Sail or final 1 Velfels to land on the back Bay which laces the Ocean; but, on their trying tp land fome Forces, they were warmly re^ pulfed,of the Eaft Indies. f T89 pulfed, and loft many of their Men, which made them draw off again in Confufion, and Mn tFard, being confronted with his own Letters, and having little to fay in his own De fence, was made a Prifoner ; and General Child's Faction was fent to Surat to him.

General Child toon difpatcht Letters to England, and gave an Account of the Rebel lion, and King Charles difpatched a Frigat, called the 'Phenix, for India, to demand the Rellltution of the Ifland, and put it^ again into the Company's Hands. They arrived at Bombay, in September 1685'. and fhewed the King's Orders, with a full Pardon to all who yielded Obedience, which unanimoufly the lllanders did ; but, for their own Security, drew up fome Articles to be figned by Ge neral Child and Captain Tyrrel, who com manded the 'Phenix, one of which Articles was. That any Perfon that had a Mind to go jor\Lx\^w\&amp;, fliould nave free Liberty, and a Tajfage on board the Company s Shipping, which being agreed to and llgned. Captain Kegwine took his Paflage on board the firft Ship; but Thorburn being a married Man, and having a fmall Eftate, ns well as a Family on the Ifland, could not fo eafily remove, but trufted to the Aft of Grace, and the Treaty they had made. After190 A new Account A fter General Child had gotten the Reins of Government again into his Hands, he became more infupportable than ever. He ereded a Court of Inquifition, and made an old Greek, one Captain Garey^ Judge, who had condemned a Man to be hanged on a Teufday^ and the Man fuffered accor ding to Sentence; but, on Friday after, the oor dead Fellow was ordered to be called efore the Court, but he would not comply with the Orders. C aptain Thorbum was the firft that felt the Weight of Mr. Child's Difpleafure. He got fome Fellows to fwear him out of his little Eftate, who brought in forged Bonds for Sums borrowed from one King, whom he never had any Dealings with, and found Wit- neffes to attell them. All that Thorburn hadj was too little to pay the Sums, for which his Eftate was taken from him, and himfelf put in Prifon, without the Permiffion of one Slave to attend or ferve him in Prifon. His own Wife was not permitted to vifit him, which hard Ufage brought him into a violent Fever, that foon put # an End to his Life. About two Days before he died the Goaler acquainted his Lady of his Danger, and Ihe, with two fmall Children, went to the Gene ral, and, on their Knees, begged that a Do- dor might be permitted to vifit her Husband, but he was inexorable, and would allow no luch t avour, only granted her Leave to be in Priion with him till he died, and Ihe Hay ed but one Day and a Part of a Night till he expired.of the Eaft Indies. x 91 expired. When the Tragedy was over, Hie was going Home to her diftrefl Family, but found her Slaves and Children removed into a little Out-houfe of hers, and the Doors of her Dwelling-houfe Ihut againft her. The Lady had two Sifters married on the Ifland, and ilie, hoping to find Relief from them, went to vifit the eld eft, but ihe met her at the Door and told her ilie could have no Admittance, her Husband being liable to Profcription, if he admitted her into, his Houfe; and ilie believed the other Sifter s Husband durft not entertain her in his Houfe* The poor Lady, full of Sorrow and Grief, being abandoned of £tll her Friends and Re lations, went back to her diftrefled Family^ and, having no vifible Way of Support, had once fome Thoughts of putting an End to her Miferies; but her Sifters, unknown to their Husbands, fent her fome Relief by a trufty female Slave in the Night, and a Let ter, (that they defired her to burn aftbon as Ihe had read') wherein they promifed to be aftifting in the Maintenance of her and her Children, till the Almighty fliould think pro per to deliver her out of the Perfecution. The poor Lady had both Beauty and Dif- cretion enough to recommend her to the virtuous Part of Mankind ; but none of the Gentlemen that wijht her well, durft make Addreftes to her, only one, who had the Command of a Ship in the Indian Merchants Service, as he had no Dependence on the General, nor his Mafters in England, thought19Z new Account he could not well come within the Reach of their Perfecution, fo he courted her, and inarried her, but that was thought a capital Crime, and the General acquainted his Indl* an Owners, that without they difcharged him their Service, they Ihould alfo find the Weight of his Difpleafure; and accordingly, to avoid Contefts with his Excellency, he was dif- charged : But Grief put an End to his Trou bles, for he died within a Year after hisMar- riage, and left the poor Lady another Child to take Care of, but left her above 1006 L. Sterl. of Stock for her and her Family's Sup port. As the Thenix was in her Way to India, fhe called at the Ifland ot Johanna, and there found an Englijh Ship, called the Br'tftol, flopping fome Lakes in her Bottom. Cap tain Tyrrel, by a difpenfing Power from the King of England, feized her, and defigned to have carried her to Bombay, in Company of a frtfall Velfel that he had feized on the Coali of Madagafiar. The Brifiol funk the third Day after they put to Sea, but the o- ther came fafe. i he Brijtol's IVIen were looked on as Pirates, and one Mr. Mews a Supercargo was arraigned before the Gene ral's Tribunal, where he himfelf fat Lord chief Juftice, and, after his ufual Manner of beftowing opprobrious Names, he condemn ed Mr. Mews to lofe all that he had in the W orld, and 1000 Pounds befide, and to ly in Prifon, at his own Charges, till the Fine was paid ; but Mr. Vaux, who was Judge ofo/V/tf Eaft Indies^ 195 the Ifland in petty Affairs, (hewed him the Weaknefs of his Sentence, and perlwaded him to fet the poor Man at Liberty, and or der him a Paflage for England.' W hen Mr. CbiLd firft got hisCommiflion to plunder, there were two of his own Coun cil at Surat that were great Eye-fores to him, viz. Mffieurs Teiit and Boucher^ They were Gentlemen of good Intereil in England, and had great Remittances of Mo^ nies on the Company's Shipping coming year ly to them, to buy up Diamonds, and fend Home. General Child let them know, that he expeded Half of their Commiflions as a Perquifite to his Port, but they could not be brought to think fo: However they conde- fcended, that if he would joyn his Commit fions to theirs* which were much greater than his, they would be content to make an equal Dividend in the Commiflions ; but that Propofition he rejected, and was refold ved to carry his Point by Fraud, and wrote to the Company in England, of thofe two Gentlemens ill Services relating to the Com pany's Affairs, tho' none knew of any, but Mr. C/j/7^himfelf. Thofe Gentlemens Friends in the Committee of the Company in England) acquainted them, by Letters over Land, of the Danger they were in, and gave them Warning to be on their Guard ; and they ac cordingly took an Houfe contiguous to. the Faftory, and, by Degrees, conveyed what they thought fit into their new Lodgings, but | N re-194 netw Account retained their old ones in theFaftory. When the Shipping arrived, and the Company's Packet was opened, and read at the Council Table, Mr. 'Petit fat in his Place as fecond, and Mr. Boucher in his as fourth. When fome few Paragraphs were read, one was to difmifs thofe Gentlemen from the Company's Service, and were forthwith ordered to with draw, which accordingly they did, and went to their new Lodgings without the Fadory. Aflbon as the Council broke up, Mr. Child fent Orders to confine them in their Faftory Rooms ; but Word being brought that they were not in the Faftory, but their Doors were lockt, he gave Orders to break them open, and fecure all that was found in them for him, efpecially their Papers and Books; but they found nothing but a Bed furniflied, and fome empty Trunks. When Mr. Child underftood that their Effeds and Papers were removed, he raved like a mad Man, but to no Purpofe, fo he perpetrated their Deflru- cHon by Fraud; but the profcrib'd being well beloved by the Brokers, who were always of Mr. Child's Cabinet Council, were timely ad- vertifed of his Plots, and prepared to coun terplot him. He was the firft that bribed the Mogul's Governors to joyn in Villany with a Prefident ; but 'tis now a very common Piece of Policy at Surat, and has been often made ufe of againlt the Englijh Company, fince Mr. Chilas Time: However, for a Sum of about 4000 L '. Sterl. he got the Gover nor of the Town to ftretch his Commiffion, in&lt;i.i ij J.J, JQtJiMi - of the Eaft Indies. 195 in pretending to diftribute Juftice^ which.is only the Cadjees Place to do. He got the Governor to command the two Vidims to meet at a Garden near the Town, and to deliver them up to the Genera^ who was there with a Dozen of Grenadeers to receive them, and carry them on board of a Ship that Jay ready to tranfport them to Bombay^ and there to feed on the Bread of Affliction as long as they lived. He had fuborn'd 1 Gentleman to draw up an Account, wherein the Delinquents were brought in Debtors to the Company 114000-Rupees, or^ i^-i^o Z&gt;. Sterl. and that Gentleman fwdre to the Ac count. The two Defendants being forewar ned of the Plot, had given Bonds to their Mahometan and Heathen Friends, for above Double the Sum that the honeft General de manded ; and it is againft their Law to force any Perfon out of the Mogul's Dominions^ who is indebted to his Subjeds; but when Mr. Harris had fworn to the Account^ ( for that was the Gentleman's Name ) the Gover nor ordered the two Gentlemen Defendants to be put in Irons, and to be delivered to Mr, Child ; but their Friends protefted againlfe their going, till they had fatisfied their Cre ditors, and declared the Governor liable to make good all the Sums contained in their Bonds, if by Violence they were fent away. That Protell flartled the General and Go vernor bothj fo the Gentlemen were delive red to their Friends, and the Governor was no Lofer by the General's Honeffy: How- J N ^ fcvefiy6 A new Account ever they could not live in Quiet, fo Mr. | Tetit bought a Ship to go a Trading, whilft Mr. Boucher went to the Mogul's Court, or I rather his Camp, to try if he could procure [ a Thirmaund or Charter to be under the Mo- | gul\ Protedion ; but the Company's Money had crept into the Secretary of State's Purfe that retarded Mr. Bouchers Affair fome time: But the General, being afraid of his Succefs, s fent a Banyan from Bombay to poifon Mr. Boucher. This Banyan being often about his Tent, got acquainted with his Cook, thinking him to be the propereft Perfon to make ufe of in that Affair; and, after fome Difcourfes about General Child and Mr. Bou chers Quarrel, he told the Cook, that he had a Commiffion from the General to fettle a Salary on him during Life, and the Sum of 5 *00 Rupees in hand, if he would poifon his Mafter. The Cook feemed to like the Pro pofals, and bid the Banyan bring him the Poifon and the ^00 Rupees, and accordingly the next Day he did, and, on the Delivery 1 of the Money, he gave him a Paper with fome Powder of white Arfenick to mix with his Mailer's Rice, which is a common Difh there. The Cook gave him large Promifes of performing what he would, and fo left him, and went to his Mafter with the Bag of Money and the Paper of Arfenick, and told him, that he had made a Bargain with Gene ral Child's Vakeel^ or Attorney, to poifon him, and told him the Terms he had agreed on, and lliewed the Money and Poifon. Mr. Boucherof the Eaft Indies. 197 Boucher commended the Cook's Fidelity &gt; and told him, that he would give him 600 Rupees to be honed, and a Maintenance du ring Life. And Mr. Boucher being bred a Druggift in his Youth, prefently knew the Poifon, and carried it to the Cautwal or She riff, and fliewed it. The Cautwal ufed his utmoil Endeavours to catch the Banyan^ but he could never be found there. M r . Boucher had been fourteen Months Soliciting to procure his 'Phirr&amp;aundi but his repeted Petitions to the Secretary had no Ef- fed: But he had an Engl'ijh^hx\^ ox^Swan^ for his Interpreter, who often took a large Dofe of Arrack. Aurengzeb one Day had ordered his Camp to remove to another Place, and had got on Horfe-back. Swan took hold of that Opportuity, and got pret ty near the King, holding his Petition or Roc- ca above his Head, and cried with a loud Voice in the Language, that his Ma iler wanted Juitice done him. The Mogul feeing him in an European Garb, ordered him to be brought to him, and askt the Caufe of his Complaint. He anfwered, that his Ma- Iter had been fo long at Court about procu ring a ¥hirmaund to become a Subjeft of his Majefty's, to be freed from the OpprelHons of the Englijh Company, who were grown intolerable by the Connivance of his Majelly's Governors of Suraty and therefore conjured his Majefty, as he fliould anfwer before Cod at the great Day, to do his Mailer Jullice, mid grant him a Thirmaund, The King was N 3 HartledA new Account ftartled at the bold Expreflions, ordered his Secretary to get one ready for the Seal a-: I gainft the next Day, which was accordingly done, aud Mr. Boucher had it delivered to him affoon as it was figned, and then took his Leave of the Court. W hilp Mr. Boucher was at Court, Mr. fPetit made fome Voyages into the Gulf of Terjuiy and going thither once, met with fome Sanganian Pirates, who attackt him. He 1 defended c Jiimfelf bravely, and beat them off; but his Gunner firing a Blunderbufli out of one of the Gun-room Ports, blew the Ship , up, and the Sanganians took up thofe that were faved by fwimming, among whom was Mr. T^etit himfelf. T he Sanganians carried their Prifoners to Baet on Guzerat^ and laid a Ranfom on them, which Mr. 'Petit agreed on, and fent Let ters to his Friends at Surat to pay the Mo ney: But General C^/7^ hearing of Mr. 'Pe- tit's Misfortune, and where he was, difpatcht a Banyan to Baet, to perfwade the Pirates not to part with their Prifoner under 15000 L.Sterl. and fo they, hearkning to the Ba nyan, would not ftand to the ftipulated Ran fom of 5000 L. Mr. Tetit flayed about fix Months their Prifoner, and then died through Grief, and the ill Treatment he had receiv ed by Mr. Child's Perfwafion; but the Pi rates getting no Ranfom, curft the General for his Counfel. In Anno 1683. the 'Dutch difpoffeft the £nglifh Company of their Faftory of Ba?j~of the Eaft Indies. 199 tahh on the Weft End of Java ; and the Englijh having a Mind to regain it by Force of Arms, built feveral Ships between 60 and 70 Guns, fo that in Anno 1685. they had a Fleet ready viftualled, and mannd with 7 or 8000 Men, to the Number of 13 Sail of Line of Battle Ships, which Expence, and the con tinual Craving of the Court, brought their Stock very low; yet fince the Maw of the Court was not enough crammed, the King laid Embargoes on the Fleet from Time to Time, for nine Months, and then the®«^Ambaf- fador had Orders to prefent his Majefty with 100000 Pounds, if he would command the Company not to ufe Violence. He fnapt at the Bait, and defeated the Defign to all In tents and Purpofes. CHAP. XVIII, Continues the Obfervations on the Affairs of Bombay, with the Articles exhibited by Mr. Child, in order to embroil the Compa ny s Affairs with the Mogul and his Sub- jetts, ' I H E Company having fuch a Number X of great Ships on their Hands, were obliged to fend them abroad; but having no Stock to employ them, ordered the General and Chiefs of their Faftories in India to bor row what Sums they could on the Compaq ny's Credit, from the Indian Merchants, to N 4 lade &lt;5.oo A new Account lade their Ships Home, which accordingly they did, and what they could not lade Home, they were to employ by Freights in India. And I favv a Letter from the Govern nor of the Company in England, intimating, that when they nad got as much Credit of the Mogul's Subjects as they could, then tlicy would pick Quarrels with the Creditors, and put a general Stop to their Trade, which was accordingly done; for, in 1686 and 87. the Surnt Merchants, traded briskly by Sea to. Mocha, 'Perfia and Bajfora, to the W ed- vvard, and to Bengal, Atcheen, Malacca and StamyXo the Eaftward. The General grant ing Palles to all who required them, then, about the latter End of the Year 1687. he laid down a Complaint and Grievance before the Governor of Surat, and demanded Re- drefs and Satisfa^ion. The Articles of his Grievances I faw in a printed Copy, and were as follows, in 35- Articles. I. c 'Last Year a Ship of Molah Abdel 6 ' Gafoars coming from Juddah, in her Re- Lrc turn met with two c bamjh Pirates, who tC made a Prize of her. The News coming ^ to Surat, the faid Molah Abdel Gafoar, by ^ Perfwalions of Meir Nazam, and other cc Merchants, made their Complaints to Sa- u labat Caun (then Governor ) and other Of- * c peers of Surat, faying, the Englijh belong- ■ c i n g to Surat, had taken his Ship, at the fame Time fending his Attorney to Court, 10 complain to the King, who ordered the J? Governor, Officers of Surat, to en- ' quireof the Eaft Indies. lot £ ' quire into it, and do jullice accordingly. &lt;c In this Affair, by Bribry, and difgracing me tc to the King and his Subjefts, as alfo the '' 'Dutch, French^ and other Nations, making Ct them believe it to be true, for which Dif- ' grace I am not able to trade in thefe Parts; tc but I hope the Difgrace will light on him, Cfc that hereafter no fuch Scandal may be put ' c on me, or any other, we having traded &lt;c here thefe 80 or 90 Years, but never be- * fore accufed as Robbers, but daily enrich- tC ed the Port of Surat. II. cC T h e Complaints of Mulah Ahdel Ga- tC foar have been much to my Prejudice, by tC reafon I could not clear my Money out of ' the Cuftom-houfe, nor fhip my Goods for tC Europe, which were feized and hindred, tc which hath made me leave the Port and &lt;c Trading, and retire to Bombay. I have by cc me 30 or 40 Lack of Rupees in Money C4 and Goods in a Readinefs; if you pleafe Ct to fend any Body, you may be certified of c ' the Truth.

III. tC Mulah Abdel Gafoars difgracing me, ^ makes People afraid to truft me, my Cre- dit being lofl by his falfe Reports, having a ix Ships laden with Goods, which I de- cC ligned to have fent to Surat, there to have cc provided Goods, and relade for Europe; but his difgracing me is the Occafion of y the great Charges I am at, my Ships win- ? tering2.0Z ji new Account ' tering in thefe Parts, and my Goods Jying cc on my Hands, we Merchants trading for cc Profit, which Hindrance hath not only ' been a great Lofs to the King in his Cu- iC ftoms, but to me, which I mult anfwer to ' my Maflers. IV. ' Mr . 'Petit and Mr. Boucher being Cc indebted to the Company feveral Sums or ' Money, I would have called them to ac- Ci count for the fame; but they, like Trai- tors, went to the Governor Cortalab Cautp ' for Protedion. As for Mr. Tetit he is ? dead, and gone to the Devil. Mr. Boucher cc ftill remains at Surat. I demand him, his &lt;c Wife, Child, or Children, Family, and all &lt;c Engl'tjh Men belonging to him, with their cc Lffeds, that they be delivered to me, and ' that he may not make his Efcape from ' Surat, V. ' Fo rmerly fuch Goods as we ' brought from the Malabar Coaft, Mocha x iC and other Parts, which were for Europe^ cc and not to fell here, we had Liberty to ct bring them afliore at Swally^ to clean them, and fhip again, without paying Cuftom 5 ' but the Governor Cortalab Cautiy in his tC Time, forced us to pay Cuflom for thofe ^ Goods. My Demand is, that what he took &lt;l more than the former Cufloms, may be t 1 reftored, and he do not the like again. VI. ^ O f late Years we bring more Mo- ct ney than formerly, which hath much en- richt the Port, of which the Governor did i c acquaint the King, who was pleafedtotake I' nQof the Eaft Indies. zoj no more than x fer Cent, we paying no Ct more for many Years. Of late the Gover- nor of Surat did write to the King, to make us pay three and one half &lt;c per Cent, for Money as well as Goods, ^ which has been a great Prejudice to our 44 Trade. My Defire is, that we may pay ct no more than formerly, and that the for- tt mer Overplus may oe repaid. Which * c ExadrHngs made Sdab at Caun over-rate our tc Goods in the Cuftpm-houfe, to our great ' Damage. VII. ^ Fo rmerly we never paid Cu- &lt;6 ftom for Apparel or Provifions, but of late ^ Salabat Caun forced us to pay Cuftom for &lt;c them. My Defire is that may be repaid, and, tc for the future, no more Trouble on that Account. VIII. W hen our Goods came out of &lt;c the Country, if robbed by Thieves or o- tC therwife on the Road, it is the King's Or- der, that the Governors and Officers make 44 good all Damages, or elfe the King to fa- &lt;c tisfy us himfelf. Few Years fince our 44 Goods coming from Amadabant and Cl r 'tmgum^ were robbed in the Way to Su~ 44 rat. We have petitioned the Governor of ♦ c Surat for Satisfadion, but never obtained 44 any. My Defire is, that the King order ' Satisfaction to be made for the Lofs we * c fullained, being great and confiderable. IX. cc S everal of the Natives are in- a debted to us, of whom we can get no Sa- M tisfadion, having feveral Times made Com- S plaints2.04 necW -Account ' plaints to the Governors, where they re- cc fide, for their Afliftance, but, as yet, could ' have no Redrefs from them. Our Defire 4C is, that all Governors and their Officers ' may be affiltant to us in recovering our ' Debts. X. 'W e bring more Treafure into the ' Country than any other Nation, which is ' carried to the Cuftom-houfe, when clear- &lt;c ed from thence, we fend it to the Mint to be coined; but the Officers, for their &lt;c own Intereft, delay the Coining, to the Hindrance of the Difpatching our Bufinefs, for, if our Cafh was coined in Time, we &lt;c could have our Invedments out of the cc Country, and lade our Ships according to ' the Monfoons or Seafon of the Year. Our ' Requeft is, that, for the future, the Coin- ers may not delay the Coining, and that cc our Treafure may be coined apart, for tC its more fpeedy Performance. XL C4 A t the Arival of our Ships, when ' unladen, we carry our Goods to the Cu- flom-houfe, where they are thrown up &lt;c and down very carelefly, where they are cC broken, damaged and ftolen. Our Requeft &lt;c is, that we may have a Ware-houfe apart ' by that of the 'Dutch, to put our Goods cc in, that we may be no further Sufferers, ' that, when we dilpoie of our Goods, or tC fend them to our Fafioyy, that the Cuftomer ' take Account of the King's Cuftoms, clear- Si ing them without farther Moleftation. XII. 'F orof the Eaft Indies. 205 XII. 'Formerly when we cleared our ' Treafure, &amp;c.

Of late Years the cc Officers of the Cuftom-houfe daily and ' monthly fend to our Broker, demanding cc the Cuilom, for which Reafon we are for- &lt;c ced to fee the Officers not to affront our &lt;c Broker, which has been much to our Pre- &lt;c judice. Our Requeft is, that they demand &lt;c not the Cuftoms till the End of the Year, &lt;c as formerly accuftomary. XIII. ' When Gajfadean Caun was Go- tC vernor of Surat, by Order of the King, Ct the City was walled, at which Time we cC had a Garden near Bramfore Gate, about cc which we built 34 Shops, Stables for Hor- cc fes, a Summer-houfe, and feveral other cc convenient Places, all firm Buildings, which coft to the Amount of i ^ooo Rupees, 'when the Wall came near our Garden, ' our Buildings were broke down, and our Ct Garden fpoiled. We petitioned the Go- cc vernor for Satisfadion, he promifed to al- &lt;f low us the Charges out of the King 's Trea- tC fury; but we have not received any Satif- 'fadion. We demand Satisfadion for the f c faid Charges. XIV. 'F ormerly when our Goods ' came from other Parts to Surat, we paid ' no more than due Cuitom, and Ihipped ^ them for Europe, or other Places, with- ' out any farther Trouble. Of late Years the ^ Offi.Z0(5 A new Account u Officers of thofe Places, from whence our ' Goods come, put us to much Trouble in &lt;c demanding the Governor's and Officers tc of Surafs Receits of us, and many Time^ c ' detain our Goods on that Account, by which their Proceedings our Ships fometimes re- &lt;c turn empty, and fometimes are forced to remain in the Country^ which is a great Lofs ' to the King in his Cuftoms, as well as to us. &lt;c Our Requeft is, that, for the future, fuch Ct Receits may not be demanded of us, but that ' we may have the fame Liberty as formerly. XV. 'W hen our Goods are in a Rea~ * dinefs, we fend them to the accuftomed tC Place to be Ihopt, with a true Invoice of tc the Contents of the Bales.

Our &lt;4 Requell is, that whatever Englijh Man, em- C£ ployed in your Service, without our Leave Ct and Difcharge, that they, with their Ef- 44 feds and Ellates, be delivered to us, that &lt;c they may not be proteded, but that we ' may proceed againli; them, as we think con- ' venient. XXIV. cc I t is near 90 Years that w£ have rc traded h^re. At our firft Coming, the King granted us a Piece of Ground for a ' Bunder to repair our Ships and VelTels. Of &lt;c late Years hath forced itfroni 4C us, and made it a Garden. We are defti- &lt;c tute of a Place for rep^riring Our Veffels, ' and other Conveniencies. Our Requeft is, that we may have the fame Ground as for- merly, or fome other riear the WaterSide, fitting our Occafions. XXV. ^ Fo r merl y we ufed to pay for cc each Bale of Indigo, two and an half Ru^ ^ pe^s per Bale^ without opening it 4 Of late Years the Officers open it, valuing it at t 0 ' theijtz I o A new Account &lt;c their Plcafure, damaging the Goods, which &lt;r is a great Lofs and Charge to us in repack- ' ing it. Our Defire is, that, for the future, &lt;c it may not be opened, paying the Cullom 5 C as formerly. XXVI. ' The Governor, Officers buy &lt;c of us, for the King's Account, Iron, Guns, &lt;c Lead, giving us fome Money in Hand. &lt;c When they are turned out, and others &lt;£ come, when we demand the Remainder, ' they delay the Payment of the Money, &lt;c faying the King did not want our Goods, tC that ^e may take them again, fometimes Cc after they have kept them one or two ' Years. Our Requeft is, that whatever they &lt;c buy of us for the King's Account, we may &lt;c be paid before they take them from us, &lt;c and whatever Goods we have that the King^ ' has no Occafion for, we may difpofe of them at our Pleafure. XXVII. 'As to the Ifland of Bombay, it 44 produceth no Corn. The M^/Z's Fleet of- &lt;c ten winters there, which makes Provifions tc fcarce and dear. We are in W^antofSup- ' plies from Stir at, and other the Mogul's ct Ports. When we fend to thefe Places, the &lt;6 faid Governor and Officers will not let us &lt;c have any without giving them one and one ' Fourth per Cent. Our Requeft is, to be free ' of this Tax, that we may have Liberty of &lt;c fending what is heceffary for Supply of the &lt;c King's People and faid Ifland. XXVIII. ' A Ship, with her Cargo, to the &lt;c Amount of 154000 Rupees, came out of ' Eng-of the Eaft Indies. 111 ^ England without our King's Licence, which &lt;c came to Surat. Our King's Orders came ^ to us to feize Ship and Cargo, which ac- tc cordingly we did; but Salabat Caun then cc being Governor, forced her from uSj and Cc delivered her to Mr. Boucher. Our Defird &lt;c is, the faid Ship may be re-delivered us^ that Mr. Boucher and his Broker give us a cc jult and true Account of the Remainder ' of the Cargo, and that the Governor cc take Care it be not fquandred aw^iy by Ct them. XXIX ' T i s the King's Grant, that Mer- &lt;c chants pay butoneCuftom for their Goods, ' without farther Moleftation, and, when &lt;c they pay it, to take a Difcharge. Of late ' Years, the Officers have forced us to pay cc double Cuftom, befides their Perquifites ' which they have demanded, which has been ' c a great Hindrance to the timely Arrival of ' our Goods. We defire we may not be ' forced to pay more than accuftomary. XXX. &lt;c W e formerly rented a Piece of 4C Ground for Stables, on which we were at confiderable Charges in building and Re- parations. Meer Najfam, by buying it, de- ' prived us of it. We defire he may fatisfy ' us the faid Charges. XXXL^S ome Years fince we loft an ' Anchor at the River's Mouth, which Mir- tc z&gt;a Mojfum's People took up* We haveof- tc ten demanded it, offering to defray the Charges he was at, but cannot get it. Our ^ Requeil is, that his Son Mirza Mahomui • J' Ox ' Araffi I i A new Account &lt;c Arajf deliver the fame, we paying th(5 tC Charges they were at. XXXII. ' At the Arrival of our Ships, &lt;c they fend the Boat up with News. At thd I tC Cullom-houfe they itop her a whole Day ' before they will let our People come a- cc fhore with Letters, which is a great Impe- &lt;c diment to our Affairs. Our Requeil is, ' that they may not be hindred for the fu- c ' ture, but futfered to land aflbon as they ' come to the Cuftom-houfe. X^tXIII. 'As concerning my we , f c hear feveral Ships have been taken and i burntj in which Affair we are not concer- | 41 ned, neither do we know whether Peace &lt;4 be concluded there or not. Our Requeft is, that the Kin^ ilfue out his Orders* that no Perfon quettion us, or make Demands 5 C on us on that Account. XXXIV. 'Some Years ago the Sedee, &lt;c with the King's Fleet, wintered at Bombay^ &lt;c in which Time fome of his People murde- &lt;c red two of our Englijh Men, which made &lt;c our Men refolutely refolve to revenge theii* iC Death, but, with great Perfwafions were ' pacified, being promifed Satisfaction. We acquainted the Governor of it, who orde- 1 ' red the Murderers to be imprifoned ; bur, ' three Days after, they were cleared by &lt;c the Sedee. Our Requeit is, they may be de- cc livered, that we may profecute them, and iC that Juflice may be done. XXXV. 'W hen we are minded to take c&lt; our Pleafure out of the City, altho' we re^ turaof the Eaft Indies. zij turn before the ufual Time of fliutting the Cc Gates, the Porters fliut them ngainlt us, ' demanding Money before they will let us &lt;c enter the City. Our Requelt is, that Or- tC der be given by the Governor, that we be no more affronted by thofe People. These Grievances were the Foundation on which General Child built a War with the Mogul, without ever fending them to Court to know the King's Pleafure, but, without decla ring War, feized his Subjefts Ships wherever they were found, altho' they had the Sanftion of his own PalTes. If the fourth Article be C^ri- ftlan the Mahometans and Heathens abhor it. The feventeenth and twenty third are unjufl, as well as the twenty eighth; and the thirty and thirty firfl were but weak Arguments to help to fupport his Complaints and raife a War, that coft his Matters above 400000 Pounds before they could lay it, befides the Lofs of their Credit with the Mogul and his Subjeds, which, to this Time, is not quite recovered. Or by what Rule in Policy could Sir JoJlah or Sir ^john Child think to rob, murder and deftroy the MoguPs Subjefts in one Part of his Dominions, and the Company to enjoy a free Trade in the other Parts? or how they could expeft that he would (land neuter, let Politicians anfwer them, and I'll proceed. The General having fuch a Number of great Ships on his Hands, and little Employ ment for them, fent them to Mocha, Terfia and Bengal, where the Suraters had fent theirs under the Protection of his Pafles. O 3 Cap-ZI4' neew Account Captain Andrews in the Charles II. went to Mocha^ and fet up the King of England\ Flag on his Fadory, and there he feized two Engltjh Ships, one from England, called the Streights Merchant, commanded by Captain Bear, and another belonging to Mr. Samuel White at Si am. She was commanded by one Captain IVren, whom they killed in his Cab- bin, becaufe he would not deliver his Ship up voluntarily. There was but little of their Cargoes on board of the Ships, fo they might as well have let them alone: However fuch Doings diipleafed the Governor and Mer- ehants of Mocha, and they had a Defign to force Captain Andrews to reflore the Ships, but hefufpefting as much, fled on board, and kft his Colours flying on his Fadory. He foon after left MocJya, and carried his two Prizes with him, and Mr. Clive, Super cargo of the Str eights Merchant, got Bills for his Stock, payable at Grand Cairo, except about 60 Bales of Coffee that he carried with him to England, where it Ibid very well, and the Company were obliged by the Law to make good all the Ship's Cargo fro rata, as thofe 60 Bales fold for, which amounted to 31000 Pounds. The Brijiol's Cargo was alfo made good to her Owners, with the Ship that was taken at Johanna by the Thenix, which came to 60000 Pounds. And the Little Betty, that was alfo taken by the Thenix in her W ay to India, cod them 12000 Pounds, tho 1 Ihe and her Cargo were fold at Bombay for lefs than 600 Pounds. The Owner of that Vef- ^ : '• ' fdi la of the Eaft Indies. 115 fel was one Mr. Hafiewell a Quaker, and a fubftantial Merchant in London, who arretted Captain Tyrrel going off the Exchange. The Captain proferred King James for Bait, but the Quaker would not accept of him, but was content to accept of Sir Jofeph Hey^ne, who became Bail. The Charles, Cefar, and Royal James and Mary way-laid the Surat Shipping, and brought in fourteen Sail to Bombay, where I faw them lying in Anno 1688. and yet no War with the Mogul, only with the Inhabi tants of Surat, whom he threatned to humble. I n Ottober 1688. he went to Surat Road, in the Royal James and Mary, with three or four other Ships of Countenance, to try if he could bully the Governor, and frighten the Merchants into a Compliance of lofing their Eftates, but was difappointed in both. He llaid there till the Beginning of January 1689. an&lt; ^ then left Surat in an Huli, and brought all the Engltjh Ships along with him, except the Ship Adventure, whom the C Phe rn x had forced over the Bar, when flie was lying at the River's Mouth, taking in a Car go for England, under the Proteftion of Mr. Boucher's 'Bhtrrnaund, which was the Griev ance complained of in the 18 Article: How ever, her Supercargo dying, the Ship's Bot tom was eaten up with Worms in the River, and Part of the Cargo remained many Years in Mr. Boucher's Poireffion. O n the General's Paflage to Bombay, he met with a Fleet of Veffels that were carry- O 4 in ? rV sM116 A nemo Account jng Corn to an Army of the Mogul's that lay ^Dunder-rajah-pore^ about 14 Leagues to the Southward of Bombay. That Fleet he alfo feized, and carried to Bombay, tho' a- fainft the Opinion of mod pf his Council, iefpre this Seizure he askt the Opinion of fome Sea-officers, and one Captain HiLder, being the eldeft, advifed him not to meddle with the Corn Fleet, becaufe it would ilrait- en the Army, and force them to look abroad for Provifions, where it might befl be procu red, and perhaps might affeft Bombay&gt; which was in a great Meafure beholden to their Neighbour^ for Sullenance and Fire-wood. The General tqok him up with fcurrilous Language, calling him Coward and Fool, and tragg'd, that if Sedee Tacoup ( which was the Mogul\ General's Name ) ftould dare to come with his Forces on fiombay, he vyould blow }iim off again with the Wind of his Bum. C owards a^e generally flout when Dan gers are at a Diftance,' and fo was our Gene ral, who had never feen a Sword drawn in Anger, and confequently very ill acquainted with War; and when it came to his Door, none w^s ever fo confounded and dejeded as he was, as appeared by his Condud in that War that he fo foolilhly brought on himfelf and his Country. Chap,of the Eaft Indies, 117 CHAP. XIX. Gives an Account of the IVar of Bombay, be tween the Mogul and the Englilli Eaft-in- dia Comfany, with AurengzebV Letters of Advice to the Governor of Bombay, on granting them a Teace and new Indulgen ces in Trade. WHEN the News came to Sedee Ta- coup, that his Fleet, with his Provifi- ons of Corn and Cloth, were feized and car ried to Bombayi he fent a civil Letter to our General tp difcharge his Fleet, protefling, that as he had not meddled in the Affairs between him and the Suraters, he would con tinue neuter, unlefs he was forced to do o- therwife: But our General gave him an in- folent Anfwer, and the Fleet was unladed at Bombay. Sedee Tacouf fent again to defire the Deli very of his Fleet in fair Terms, otherwife hp Would be obliged to come with his Army, and quarter on Bombay^ where his Provifions were detained, and that if his Fleet was not fet at Liberty before the n of Februaryy which was near at hand, he would certainly be on Bombay the 14. but ftill receiving unci vil Anfwers, he performed hi$ Promife to a Tittle, for that very Night he landed at a Place called Souree (about four Miles diftant from the main Fort) with 20000 Men at his Back. Our General's Security had made him ne glect providing for receiving fuch Guefts, tru- ' flingZ18 A new Account fling to the Reputation of his Forces, who were greater then than ever they had been be fore, or ever were fince that Time, and he had fmall Ships enow, had they been placed in proper Places, that might certainly have hind- red his Landing, and forced him Home again; but all thofe necelfary Preparations were ne- ; glefted, and the Sedee landed at Mid-night, and the Redoubt where he landed, fired a great Gun to give the Alarm, and fo defert- ' ed their Poft, and the Sedee took Polleflion of it. At One in the Morning the Caftle fir ed three Guns to give the general Alarm, which brought fuch Fear on thofe that lived fecurely in their Houfes without the Caftle, that the poor Ladies, both white and black, run half-naked to the Fort, and only carried their Children with them; but they were all obliged to wait without the Wall, till Day light relieved them. Next Morning the marched to Ma- zagun^ a fmall Fort of 14 Guns, and about a random Shot diftant from the Caftle. On the Enemy's Approach, that Fort, tho' fitua- ted on a Point of Rocks, where the Sea de fended three Quarters of it, was alfo defer- ted in fuch Precipitancy, that eight or ten Cheils ofTreafure, which generally contain toco Pounds each, and four Chefts of new Arms, were left behind, tho' the Seamen that were fent in Boats to bring them ofti proferred to carry them along with them ; but the commanding Officer thought them not fit to be trufted with Money and Arms &gt;of the Eaft Indies. lip and fo they were left for a Prefent to Sedee Tacoup, with fourteen Cannon, two Mortars, with fome Powder, Shot and Shells: But why that Treafure, and thofe Arms and Am munition were depolited in Mazagun, few could account for, and the Reafons why they were left to the Enemy were as wonderful ; but it was plain, that the old Way of Fifhing in troubled Waters was known at Bombay y and the Officer was never called to account for his Overfight. Sedee Tacoup finding no Oppofition, fent a Party of Men towards Mahim, to plunder the poor Peafants, and to take that Fort, which, he thought, might be deferted as the reft had been, and was not in the leaft out in his Conjedure, for the Garifon had em- bark'd in Boats, and came by Sea to Bombay, before they faw an Enemy. The Sedee ta king PofTeffion of Mazapun, hoifled his Flag there, and made it his head Quarters. The following Day fome of the Enemy appeared on Mazagun Hills, which grieved our GeneraFs righteous Soul to fee Infidels come fo near him in an hoftile Manner. He called a Minion of his own, one Captain Te- aity who was no better Soldier than himfelf, and ordered him to take two Companies, each containing about feventy Men, and march to thofe Hills, and drive the Enemy out of his Sight. He ordered one Monro&gt; who had been a Soldier at Tangier, to be his Lieutenant. In Tangier he had received a Wound in his Heel, that fpoiled his Running,Zio A new Account and accordingly they marched in good Or-? der within Shot of the Enemy, who (hewed their Heads above the Surface of the Hill, hut did not offer to advance or expofe their Bodies. Several Gentlemen Volunteers took their Arms, and accompanied the little Army, The Lieutenant advifed the Captain to inarch up the Hill in Platoons, to feparate the Enemy's Forces. The Captain took it as an Affront to be advifed, told his Lieute-r nant, that, when he had the Command in his own Hands, he might ufe it as he thought fit, but, as it was intruded to him, hp would ufe it according to his own Mind, and fo ordered his Men to fpread as much as they could, and when they faw the Enemy open jn the Plain, to difcharge all at once amongfl: them, which, he faid, would terrify them, Monro oppofed his Scheme, and told him of the Danger he would bring himfelf and them into, if the Enemy fliould attack them whilft their Arms were reloading ; but nothing could diffwade him from his Projed:, and fo com^ manded his Men to fire as he had direded, The Sedees being ten to one in Numbers, and better Runners than our Men, and bet ter acquainted with clofs Fighting with Sword and Target, took hold of the Opportunity, and advanced with all their Speed, which the Captain perceiving, betook himfelf to his Heels, and was the foremoft Man to the Tor- tngueze Church, where he took Courage to Ipok behind him, to fee what was become of fiis Men. Poor Monro thinking to flop the Enemy 'sof the Eaft Indies. lit Enemy's Carreer by a Part of the W ing that he commanded, found himfelf deferted by all, but 13 or 14 llout Fellows, who were foon furrounded by the Knemy, and cut to Pieces. Tean had not Itopt at the Tortuguezc Church, had he not found a Party of 100 Men that lay there ready to fupport or re ceive him, as his Cafe Ihould require. He was a Fellow as well made for running as a- ny I ever faw, and was fo much in the Gene ral's Favour, that he had not lo much as a Reprimand for his Cowardice and Misbeha viour. This Relation I had from a Gentle man Volunteer, who kept always near the Captain while he could keep Pace with him. W hen the General left Surat^ there were feveral Gentlemen in it, fome in the Compa-* ny's Service, and fome private Perfons, who were all imprifoned, and put in Irons, except Mr. Boucher and his Dependents, who were protefted by his 'Phtrntaund. Thofe impri foned were fcurvily ufed, being obliged to pafs thro' the Streets with Irons about their Necks^ for Speftacles to pleafe the Mob. Captain Johnfon and Captain Teaman^ tho' particular Merchants, were obliged to aft their Parts in the Tragi-comedv, and conti nue Prifoners, where Captain Johnfon died, but Captain Teaman got his Liberty at the End of the War, which was about the Be ginning of June 1690. I will now return back to the Year i685, when Sir John IVeyburn was fent from Eng~ landy with a Commiflion of Judge Admiral from H ' •ziz A new from the King, and he had likewife another Commiilion from the Governor of the Com pany (which they made him believe was alfo from the King) to condemn and hang 13 of the Inhabitants of St. Helena, where, in a Tu mult caufed by the OpprelTions of the Go vernor of that Ifland, one Johnfon the Se cond was killed. Sir John JVeyburn took his PafTage to India on board the Ship don, and, in his Way, called at St. Helena, and hanged up the 13 profcribed Perfons, without Form of Procefs, for which the Com pany paid dear afterwards, and fo had Sir John, had he lived; but he finding the ille gal Proceedings of Mr. Child to be infuppor- table, and meeting with many Affronts ( from that Man without Manners) died at Bombay about two Months before the Sedee came on it. He was much lamented by all honefl Men that knew him. He was Captain of the Happy Return who accompanied the Gloce* fter when /he was bringing the Duke ofTork to Scotland, and loll by the Way. It was Captain IVeyhurn that fent his Barge to wait on the Duke, and brought him fafe on board of the Hapfy Return, who carried him forward to Scotland, for which good Ser vice he was knighted. He was ever after a great Favourite of King James, who feeing he could not be brought into his Meafures, put that Employ on him, to difmifs him with Honour. . And now the Sedee being Mafter of the whole Ifland, except the Caftle and about halfof the Eaft Indies. nj half a Mile to the Southward of the Caftle» he raifed Batteries on &lt; Dungeree Hill, which overlookt the Fort Wall, and difturbed the Garifon very much; then he put four great Guns in the Cuftom-houfe, commonly called the India-houfe, and raifed a Battery at the Moody's Hoiife, within 200 Paces of the Fort, and another in the Lady's Houfe that he had been fo unkind to, fo that it was dangerous to go out or in at the CaftleGate, till we got up an Jialf Moon before it. All Men were then preit into the Company's Service, and I amongft the reft. We paft the Months from April to September very ill, for Provifions grew fcarce by the Addition of 3000 Seva- jees that were employed as Auxiliaries in the military Service of the Company. When the Winter Months were over, at September we went to Sea with our fmall Ships, to cruize on the Mogul's Subjects, and had pretty good Succefs. I was employed in that Service, and had the Command of a fmall Privateer of 7 or 8 T uns, with twenty fighting Men, and fixteen Rowers. In three or four Months I brought nine Prizes into Bombay^ laden mod with Provifions and Clothes for the Enemy's Army, which was now increafed to 40000. but we were not allowed any Plunder, but were rather plundred our felves, for when we brought our Prizes in, our Chefts were feverely fearcht, and if we had faved any of our Pay, it was feized for the Company's Ufe, as Money we had found in the Prizes, which made us carelefs in purfuing the Ene- myA new Account my at Sea. Except when Hunger pincht we never lookt out for Prizes, by which Indif ference of ours many of the Enemy efcaped that we could have taken. T h e ill Succefs we had afliore with the Enemy, made our General Tick, and, in ^e- cember, he difpatcht two Favors to the gul\ Court, with a Stir At Merchant, called Meer Mezamie: He was our Friend, and had fome Intereft at Court. They went un der the Name of the Englijh Ambafladors. Mr. George JVeldon was firft in Commifliorl, and Abraham Navaaf a Jew was fecond. In fifteen Days they arrived at Court, being then at Jehanabant. They were received but coldly; but, about the Middle of Afrily by the fpecial AfMance of Prefents to the Of ficers at Court, they were admitted to Audi ence, but were brought to Aurengzeb\ Pre- fence after a new Mode for AmbalFadors, their Hands being tied by a Safti before them, and were obliged to proftrate. The King gave them a fevere Reprimand, and then askt their Demands. They firlt made a Con- fefllon of their Faults, and defired Pardon, then that their Thirmaund which was for feited, lliould be renewed, and that the^SW^ and his Army (liould be ordered off Bombay. Their Submimon he accepted df, and pardo ned their Faults, on Condition that Mr. fhould leave India in nine Months, and ne ver come back again^ the 'Ph'trmamd to be renewed, on Condition that Satisfaction Ihould be given his Subjeds on account of Debtsof the Eaft Indies. 22.5 Debts contracted, Robberies committed, ami Lolles and Damages made good, and, on Security given for the due Performances of thefe PremifTcs, the Sedee and his Army fhould be ordered off the Ifland. In Janua ry General Child died, which much facilita ted their Affairs, but it was kept fecret at Court, till they knew how the King would order the Affair about him. In March Meer Mezamie died alfo, and, it was fuppofed, was poilbned by fome Enemies, contrafted by his good Services to the Englijh* When he was given over by Phyficians, our Am- baffadors fent to know what he had done with foooo Rupees, he had received for fe cret Services. He anfwered, that he was forry that ever he had meddled in their Af fairs, for he had ferved them even with his Life, and yet they were not contented, for what Ufe that Sum w T as put to, he durlt not divulge. When our Affairs were in fo bad Circum- flances at the Mogul's Court, the Dutch Company had one Mr. Baroon their Ambaf- fador there, who defigned to impofe on Au- rengzeb, who, he thought, was ignorant of European Affairs. The News of the Revo lution in Britain being arrived in Indian when he had an Audience of Aurengzeb^ he began to magnify the Power and Grandeur of his Country, and vilify the Englijh. The Mo~ gul feemed to be pleafed with his Difcourfe, to encourage him to go on. He told, that the Englijh were but contemptible in Com- | P parifon2.1(5 A w® Account parifon of his Sovereigns, for they were for ced to fend the Enelijh a King to rule over them, and that if his VLijcily would exclude the End'tjh from the Trade of his Domini ons, the Hollanders would carry it to a much greater Height, and enrich his Tieaiuiy, and the Envl'tjh would not know where to get Bread. The Mogul gravely anfwered. That if his Matters were fo much fuperior to the EnMh in Power and Riches, they might eafily drive them out of Indid -y and engrofs all the Trade of his Countries to themfelves, and commanded him to tell his Mailers, that he cxpefted it from them. Then the Am- baffador excufed himfelf, and^ told, that he could aft nothing in that Affair till he ic- ceived Orders from Hollund. jhiycugzeb then reprimanded him, and lliewed him wherein he had lied, tor, fays he, about fc- venteen Years ago, the King of Finance con- quered mod of your Country in a few Days, and that it was the and not thePovv- er of Holland, that repelled him, and that it Eneland did not hold the Balance of Power, either the Emperor or the King ot France could conquer it in one Campain. The Ambaflador knew not how to an- fwer tothofeTruths: But, being lent to lo- licite fome Indulgence in their Trade, he could obtain none, and io left the Couit diftatisfied. . A fter our AmbafTadors had obtaiiicd Pardon, they began to be refpefted, and had Liberty to take their Diverfion abroad, till aof the Eaft Indies hy a new Thirmaund was drawing up, which^ according to the Method of the eaftern Courts,'took up fome Time: However Or ders were fent to the Sedee to forbear Hofti- lities, and the Englijh had the fame Orders^ fothat frequent Vifits pall between the Se dee s People and ours. And, during the War, about 60 Europeans of feveral Nations, had deferted from us, and took Pay of the Se dee. The Reafon they gave for their De- fertion, was ill Ufage they had received from fome Irijh Officers; yet mofl of them re turned after the War, on Promife of Pardom The being ready, and there- 2uired Security given, Sedee Tacouf left Bom- ay the 8 of yuney 1690* but he alio left a Peflilence behind him, which, in four Months Time, deftroyed more Men than the Wat 1 had done, and, for Joy, made a malicious Bonfire of his head Quarters Mazagun Fort.

General Child being dead, Mr. John Vaux fucceedcd him in the Government of Bombay ; but Mr. Bartholomew Harris, who had been Prifoner at Surat ( all the Time of the Rupture) had the Seigniority in the Com pany's Service; but it being not the Cuftom, for one that had been the Mogul's Prifoner (for any Crimes judged to be capital) to re ceive publick Marks of Elteem from the State, without a fingular Amnelty from the King, Mr. Vaux was obliged to go to Surat and receive the 'Phirmaund and the King's Serf aw or Prefent, which, on fuch Occafi- ons, is generally a fine Horfe, and a Suit of Clothes from Head to Foot, made of rich Atlalfes or Zeerbajias. Thofe are Sattins or Taftataes full of Gold or Silver Flowers wrought in them. The Horfe mull: never after be fold, on no Account whatfoever. They have alfo a fine Turband, embroidered Shoes, and a Dagger of Value, ftuckinto a fineC//^- merband or Salh; and, being cquipt in thatA new A Habit, the &lt; Ph'trmaund is prefented ( by the Goosberdaar or Hoshalhouckain, or, in Eng- lijh, the King's MeiFenger,) and the Gover nor of the Province or City makes a fliort Speech adapted to the Occafion, fetting forth j the great Honour conferred upon him by the greatefl King in the World, with an Ad-; monition to make future Adions deferve the Merit of fuch Favours. After the aforefaid Manner Mr. Vaux received the ^htrmaund in a gilded Box, and, according to Cuflom, put it on hisTur- band for a little While, and, by an Interpre ter, returned the Governor's Compliment, acknowledging the King's Favours, and the Governor's Civilities; and then the Gover nor conduced him from the Garden (where the Ceremony was performed) into the Ci ty, through a great Concourfe of People, who welcomed him with Shouts of Joy as he paft thro' the Streets to the Englijh Faftory. After Mr. Vaux had llaid in the City a- bout a Week, he fent to acquaint the Go vernor of the Neceffity he lay under to re turn back to his Government of Bombay \ but the Governor fent him Word, that none but he could be trufted by the King to fee the Performance of the Contraft accompli- ihed, and begged, that he would not think pf leaving the City, left the King fliould take it amifs, and repent him of the Favours he j had flievved to the Eaft-india Company ; and fo Mr. Vaux was detained an Holtage for }ils Mailers future good Behaviour.of the Eaft Indies. 23 r M r. Harris, according to that Company s ordinary Cuftom, demanded the Prefidency from Mr. Vaux, who, to fave Contention, gave it to him, tho' his Mind was fo debili- Tated, that he was but few Degrees wifer than an Ideot, and, in two Years Time, Mr. Vaux was fufpended the Company's Service, and to remain their HolVageathis own Char ges, and fo he continued till the \ear 1697. that he, by Accident, was drowned in Surat River, by a Pinnace's overfetting, in which he and his Lady had been taking a Pleafure on the Water. This Mr. Vaux had been Book-keeper to Sir JoJiah Child in England, and, tot his good Services and Behaviour, was preferred by his Mailer to a Supercargo's Poft in a Ship to China, which Trade, in thofe Times, was the mod profitable of any. within the Limits of the Company's Charter. In Anno 1684. he was fent thither on board a Ship called the Carolina, commanded by one Captain Harding ; but, Mr. Vaux and Harding difa- greeing in their Paffage to China, Mr. V aux laded the Ship, and fent her back to Eng land, while he himfelf went Paflenger on board a Surat Ship for Bombay, where he was entertained in the Company's Service as a Fador, and wrote to Sir Jofiah Child the Reafons he had for leaving the Carolina, and. his Refolution of (laying in India. Sir Jofi ah continued his Eileem for Mr. V r aux, and procured him feveral profitable Polls at one and the fame Time in the Company's Ser- P 4 vice,2^1 A new vice, and, amongll the reft, conftituted him Judge in civil Affairs, which brought him both a good Salary and Perquifites. After he was inftalled in that Office, Sir Jofiah wrote him a Letter of Admonition and Reminif- ccnce, wherein^ after many Poftulates, put him in Mind of the many Favours he had done him, and that now, having the Power of condemning the Company's Enemies, or fuch as fhould be deemed fo, particularly thofe who fliould dare to queftion the Com pany's Power over all the Britijh Subjedh in Indta, and that he expefted his Orders, from Time to Time, fhould be obferved and obeyed as ftatute Laws. M r. Vaux gratefully acknowledged Sir Jo- fiatis Favours in his Anfwer to that Letter, and promifed, that, as he had put him into that Poll of Honour and Profit, he would drive to acquit himfelf with all the Integrity and Juftice he was capable of, and that the Laws of his Country fliould be the Rule he deligned to walk by. I n Anfwer to that Letter, Sir Jofiah feem- ed to be angry, and wrote roundly to Mr. Vaux, that he expefted his Orders were to be his Rules, and not the Laws of England, which were an Heap of Nonfenfe, compiled by a few ignorant Country Gentlemen, who hardly knew how to make Laws for the good Government of their own private Families, much lefs for the Regulating of Companies and foreign Commerce, Jof the Eaft Indies. 233 I am the more particular in this Account, becaufe I faw and copied both thoie Let ters in Anno 1696. while Mr. V mix and I were Prifonersat Suvdt^o^ Account of Oap- tain Evorys robbing the Mogul's great Ship, called the Gun/way. Having given an Account ot iome Part of Sir John Child's Reign, I muftalfo remark a few Slips in the Government of fome of his Succeilbrs, and of the \V ays that they took to get into the Chair of Bombay, I remark'd before, that Mr. Harris was a very weak and indolent Perfon, very unfit to govern a Colony and the Fadories fubordinate to Bombay, and, by that Means, a cunning defigning Fellow, one Mr. Samuel ylnnejlcy had 'the Reins of the Government wholly in his Management, who fliewed, that he had malicious Wit and Avarice enough to em broil both his Matters and the private Mer chants Affairs in Surat in Harris s Fime, and, on Harris's Death, got into the Preli- dency, or rather Tyranny. The Moguls Subjefts have a good many fine large Ships that trade all over India. The Owners of thofe Ships had a very great Regard for the Courage, Conduct, and Art of Navigation of the Englijh^ above any o- ther European Nation in India ; and, for thofe Qualifications, the Indian Owners pro cured Englijh Officers to go in their Ships, and allowed them very handfom Salaries and Indulgences. The Captains had from 10 to Month. Mates from 6 to 9 L, andA nemo Account the Gunners and Boatfwains had alfo good Salaries, befides the Privilege of carrying fome Goods and Merchandizes, Freight free. Mr. Annejley thought thofe Salaries and Indulgences were too great for Seamen, fo he went about to reduce them to about one Half, and the other Moiety he lookt on as his own due by virtue of his Poit. Some through Fear or Neceffity compli ed, others again, who defpifed both his Pow er and Tyranny, would, by no Means, come into his Meafures, and thofe he lookt on as Rebels, and perfecuted them to the utmolt of his Power, bribing the Mogul's Governor to plague us; fo fome were ruined bv his Vil- Jany, whilft others bade him open Defiance: And we were not wanting on our Side to expofe him and his Matters to the Mogul's Subjeds, which, in the End, was the Lofs of both their Eiteem and Credit among the trading People of that Country.! The poor er Sort, whofe Maintenance depended on their Labour and Induttry, lofmg their Em ploys in the Moorijh Merchants Service, were obliged to fall on new Schemes to fup- port themfelves, not very well fuited to the Company's Intereft, for fome went and joyn- ed ihemfelves with the Pirates. The Company in England receiving Ac counts from every one that came from India, of Harris and Annejley s Maladminiitrations, fent out Sir John Gayer to take Care of their Affairs, He arrived in Anno 1694. with the lofty Title of General of all India. He conti-of the Ecift Indies. ^ 3 5* continued Jnnejley ijUhcCompany'sScrvice till the Year 1700. bu t/ivefed him ot all Power of doing more Mifchief; hut, m the End he difrnift him the Company s Service. S1 r John Gayer was a Man not vitious m his Temper, yet he had fome Slips m his Government that proved prejudicial to Charader, tho', in Matters of common Com merce, headed pretty regularly, till avoung ] .f, 0 f ,000 L. Portion made him dilpente with the common Methods of Matrimony. This young Gentlewoman was a Da u g'; lci of Mr. Ward's before mentioned, '-he had no Relations alive, and unadvifedly married one Mr. Solomon Loyd a Fador, and the Mar riage was clandelline, which was pofitive y a- eainft the ftatute Law of where no Marriage is binding but when the Gover nor's Confent is tackt to it. This Law bit lohn had got by Heart, and unmarried the poor Fatter after Confummation, and mar ried her to his own Son; but the iecond Marriage was attended with ill Coniequen- ces, for, whilft her Husband was at Unua, one Coleman was ordered to teach her to write good Englijh, but, neglefting thofe Orders, he taught her fomething elle, and was difcovered in the Praaifing, by a watch ful Mother in Law. The poor School-malter was fent, in Irons, on board of a Ship tor 'Ew-Lmd. And the poor Husband sHead a- ked as long as he lived. ^ „ Another Piece of ill LjOtidud was in forcing the Mocha Frigat's Men on board, a- ? ■ ■ • gainltA new Account gainrt their Wills, to proceed on a Voyage to China, notwithftanciing their ju£l Com plaints againft Edgecomb their Captain, whom the Mutineers Ihot in his Cabbin, and then turned Pirates, and infefted the Streights of Malacca, robbing and plundring all Ships that they could overcome. Captain in the T)orrel, met her there in her PalTage to China, and had a fharp Engagement with her, but got clear with the Lois of irt Men killed, and fome wounded, which difablcd the Dvi vet lo, that flic proceeded no farther than Malacca. And another Fault of Sir John\ was in fuffering himfelf and his Lady to be taken Prifoners at Swally, by the Governor of Su- rat\ Order, when he might either have avoi ded that Difgrace by Force or Flight; but it was generally believed, that that was only a Piece of Policy to get to Surat^ in order to employ his IVIoney, which he could do much better there than at Bombay. Sir Nicholas IVaite fupplanted Sir John in the Government of Bombay, and in the Piefidency. He was a IVlan of very loofe Morals ; and his bare-fae'd Injuflices and Prevarications irritated the Inhabitants and ooldiery of Bombay, that they feized him, and fent him Prifoner for Iijit^land. Fho' his vvas hioit, it was very pernicious to his Malters, as well as to particular Merchants un-' der his Junfdidion. But, to return from this Digreflion, Bom*of the Eaft Indies. Iff Bombay was governed by a Deputy, fince the Prefident was obliged to ilay zx Surat. And of feven or eight hundred Englijh that inhabited before the War, there were not a- bove fixty left by the Sword and Plague, and Bombay, that was one of the pleafantell Pla ces in India, was brought to be one of the molt difmal Deferts; but the Spirit of Inju- ftice Hill refided in it, for thofe who had ventured thro' the W ar and Plague in De fence of the Ifland, had not the Liberty of returning Home to their own Country, nor to raife their Fortune by private Trade, but all were continued preft Men in the Right Honourable Company's Service, without the Hope of Preferment, which made fomeDif- contents. And , even in the Time of War, when Strangers Ihould have been encouraged to bring Provifions on the liland, the Compa ny'sTaxes of 5 fer Cent, were exafted with great Severity, for 1 have feen the Tortu- gneze Subjeds bring twenty or thirty Poultry to the Market, and have had five of the befl taken for the Cuftom of the reft. Chap*A new Account CHAP. XX. * Gives an Account of what is remarkable on fome IJIandsy and of the Sea-coaft^ as far as Goa. nn W O Leagues from the Caftle is a fmall X Ifland belonging to the Company, cal led Butcher\ Ifland, but of no Ufe, befides hauling Ships afhore to clean, and graze a few Cattle. And, a League from thence, is another larger, called Elephanto^ belonging to the Tortugueze, and ferves only to feed fome Cattle. I believe it took its Name from an Elephant carved out of a great black Stone, about feven Foot in Height. It is fo like a living Elephant, that, at two hundred Yards Diftance, a fliarp Eye might be de ceived by its Similitude. A little Way from that (lands an Horfe, cut out of a Stone, but not fo proportionable and well-fhaped as the Elephant. There is a pretty high Mountain flands in the Middle of the Ifland, (hapt like a blunt Pyramid, and, about the Half of the Way to the Top, is a large Cave, that has two large Inlets, which ferve both for Paflage into it and Lights. The Mountain above it refts on large Pillars, hewn out of a folid Rock, and the Pillars curioufly carved. Some have the Figures of Men, about eight Foot high, in feveral Poflures, but exceedingly Well proportioned and cut. There is one that has a Giant with four Heads joyned.cf the Eaft Indies. ^59 and their Faces looking from each other He is in a fitting Pofture, with his Legs and I'eet under his Body. His right Hand is above twenty Inches long. Fhere are feveral dark Rooms hewn out of the Rock, and a hne Spring of fweet Water comes out of one Room, and runs thro' the Cave out at one of the Inlets. I fired a Fuzee into one o, the Rooms, but I never heard Cannon nor l nun- der make fuch a dreadful Noife, which con tinued about half a Minute ; and the Moun tain feemed to ftiake. Afloon as the Noife was over, a large Serpent appeared, which made us take to our Heeis, and goi out or the Cave at one Door, and he, in gi eat ri^lte, went out at the other. I judged hiin ajout 15- Foot long, and x Foot about. And thele were all that I faw worth Obfervation on that Ifland. I askt the Inhabitants of the liland, who were all Gentowt^ or Gentiles^ about twenty in Number, if they had any Account, by Hiilory or Tradition, who made the Cave, or the Quadrupeds carved in Stone ; but they coulcl give no Account. About a ^fa- oue from Elephant^ is an Ifland called oal- vaveo. It affords nothing but Fire -wood, wi'th which it fupplies Bombay. ■ And, about half a League from it, is the Ifland of Car- ronjaa, belonging .to the Tortugueze. It af fords no Trade, but Eatables for Bombay, from whence it lies Eaft about two Leagues. Between it and the main Land, is the Mouth of Ten River. And four Leagues South of Bombay, are two fmall Iflands, 'Undra and2.^.0 A new Account Cundra. The firft has a Fortrefs belonging to the Sedee, and the other is fortified by the Sevajee, and is now in the Hands of Connajee Angarie, The Englijh have made feveral Attempts to take it, but never could, tho' in Anno 1719. it had certainly been ta ken, had not a c Portugueze Traitor, who lay on one Quarter of it with fome Veflels of War to hinder Relief coming to it, betrayed his Trull, and let fome Boats pafs by in the Night with Provilions and Ammunition, which the Ifland was in great Want of. The Engliji? landed, and were obliged to retire by fome Lofs they received. About four Miles to the South-eaft of Cundra, is Culabee, a Fort built on a Rock a little Way from the main Land ; and, at high Water, it is an Ifland, belonging to the Sevajee. And, x Leagues to the South of Culabee, is Chatily a Town belonging to the 'P ortuguez,e y whofe River affords an Har bour for fmall VelTels. The Town is forti fied, and fo is an Ifland on the South Side of the Harbour, called Chaul Moar, which may be known 5* or 6 Leagues off at Sea, by a white Church built on it. Chaul, in former Times, was jw noted Place for Trade, parti cularly for fine embroidered Quiks; but now it is miferably poor. T/ande Raj afore lies feven Leagues to the Southward of Chaul, a Town belonging to the Sedee, who generally lies there with a Meet of the Mogul\ V efTels and Ships of War, and an Army of 30 or 40000 Men. This Place affordsof the Eaft Indies i\x affords a good Harbour for his Fleet, and the Country about feeds good Numbers of black Cattle, from whence Bombay is moftly fupplied, when they keep in good Terms with the Sedee, otherwife he makes them feed on Fifli, which that Ifland is plentifully ftored with; but now worfe than before the Se~ dees War. There is a Rock fortified by the Sevajee, that lies within a League of the Mouth of 'Dande Rajapore River, to the Northward, and another as far to the South ward, called the IVhale, that Ihews his Back at low Water* Coasting to the Southward from de Rajaporey are feveral fmall Rivers and thing Towns. Zeferdon is the bell, and two little Illands called Homey Coat, fortified and kept by the Sevajee. It lies $ Leagues to the Northward of &lt;r Dcibul) which flands at the Mouth of a large River, and, of old, was a Place of Trade, and where the Englifl) once had aFadory. T here is an excellent Harbour for Ship ping 8 Leagues to the Southward of c Dahuli called Sangufeer j but the Country about be ing inhabited by Raparees, it is not frequen ted : Nor is Rajapore, about 7 Leagues to the Southward of Sangufeer, tho' it has the Conveniency of one of the bed Harbours in the World, and had formerly both an Eng~ hjh and French Factory fettled there; and the Place where General Child had his Edu cation, from ten Years old to eighteen, un der his Uncle Mr. Coodjhaw, who was Chief t Q there?A new Account there, and having betrayed fome of his Uncle's Secrets, in making ufe of the Com pany's Calh in his own private Trade, his Uncle was cafliier'd, and, before the Ne phew was come to four and twenty, he had the Honour to fill his Chair. About the Year 1685'. when Aurengzeb\ , Army was in T^ecan, in order to bring Seva- jee- Rajah to Submillion, but could never do if, a Son of Auren^zeb^ called Sheek Eckbar^ had contracted a I Viendfliip with the Rajah. His Father having Notice of it, dillembled his Refentment, till he had, by fair Promi- fes, entic'd the Sevajee to come to his Camp on the publick Faith, but had a Delign to have him cut off in his Return from the Camp. Sheek Eckbar forewarned him of his Danger, while he was in the Camp, which made the Rajah depart in the Night, with out taking a formal Leave, which Aureng* zeb imputed to his Son's Advice to the Ra jah, and, to requite his Son, he had a Mind to make his Life atone for the RajaVs, but deligned it to be taken from him by Strata gem ; wherefore, pretending more Kindnefs than ordinary to his Son, he fent him a fine Horfe, richly furnifhed, and a Veil, which was very rich and beautiful, but was poifo- ned by a perfumed Powder. His Son, with great Acknowledgments, received the Pre- fenf, but, being too well acquainted with his Father's Subtilty, put not the Veft on, but deferred it to another Time, that he might put it on with more Solemnity; however he orde-of the Eaft Indies. 145 ordered it to be put on a Slave, who died in a Day or two after he put it on. On which Sheek Eckbar tied to Raj ahp of and took Shipping, with a few Attendants, for Muf- kat) where he was kindly received by two EngUJh Gentlemen, Melfieurs Ben da I and Stephens^ and they provided a Veffel to car ry him to Terfia, where he had a royal Wel come, and was foon after married to that King's Sifter, whom Mer'tweys dethroned^ and beheaded at Ifpahan. When the Englijh had a Faftory at Ra* jahpore, that Country produced the fineft Beteellas and Muflins in India ; but now all Arts and Sciences are difcouraged, and the Port not frequented. There are fine artifi cial Cillerns for Water there, and a natural hot Bath, within three Yards of a very cold one; and both are reckoned very medicinal. Ghirta is another Harbour, about x Lea gues to the Southward of Rajahfore. That is the common Place of Relidence lor Co;/- najee Angarie, which is well fortified by a ilrong large Caftle, wafht by the Sea. W he- ther Ghtria isalfo z ^tWtzendruck^ or whe ther it lies about feven Leagues more fouther- ly, I am not certain ; but that Place, to the Southward, determines the Limits of his Go vernment that Way. About Leagues to the Southward of Ghiria, is an Illand about 2 Miles in Circum ference, and fortified with a Stone Wall round it, called JMalwan. It lies about a Mile from the main Land, and is governed by an J Q x inde-244 ww Account independent Rajah, who is alfo a Freeboot er, and keeps three or four Grabs at Sea to rob all whom they can mailer. And that is all I know of him. Vtngurla lies about 4Leagues to theSouth- Malwan, and was formerly a Place or Trade; and the 'Dutch Company had a raaoi y there for Cloth, both fine and coarfe. .but, in Anno 1696. a Rajah, called Kemp a- fin, overrun that Country, and fubdued if, ^under Pretence of vifiting the 'Dutch dyci Faftor, took an Opportunity of the Dutch being in Security, leized their Fafto- ry, and plundred it, but killed no Body. 1 he trading People in the Country, in and a- bout the Town, having no Security for their ci Ions and Eflates, fled to the (r Portn&lt;^iieze Dominions of Go a, that lies within 6 Leagues of VingurLa. r l 'he Rajah fai&amp;ing the Country delerted by the Natives, wrote to the Vice- loy of Goa. to fend them back, but, on his -Noncompliance, entred xhc^Portit^nezeTev- ntoi ics, and plundred and burnt all he could jay Hands on, not fparing the Churches and Images, for which Sacrilege the Tortnqiieze gave him the Name of Kema Sanflo, or. Saint burner ; and they raifed a Force fufficient to drive him and his Freebooters out of their . ^nnons, but, for many \ ears, continued in nis Robberies, when Opportunity prefen- tcd, which kept the poor Country Peafants continually alarmed ; and, for all the 'Portu guese x laughtinefs and Pride, they were at laflof the Eaft Indies. 145 kft forced to buy a Peace, and allow him a yearly Penfion to keep him quiet. He is a Soldier of-Fortune, and willferve thofe Rajahs who hire him beft, fo that if he alMs one at one Time, if another gives him better Hire, he tacks about, and ferves on the other Side. His Army conflils of 7 or 8000 Men, and he had % Grabs a Pirating at Sea, but, in a Difpute about a Prize which Connajee Angar 'ie laid Claim to, they went to War, and Connajee being much fuperior to him in Power, firft took his Grabs and burnt them, and then landed at Vingurla, and burnt and deftroyed the Villages near the Town. And I know not if ever they made Peace fince. Two Leagues to the Northward of Vin~ gnrla River there is a Parcel oi Rocks that llretches about 2 Leagues into the Sea. The outermoft lies in 17 Fathoms of Depth. They feem to have been Vulcanoes. The Religion of all the Countries, from Dande RajaporCy to the Dominions of Goay is Tagamfm ; but they are not tied up to divine or moral Rules. And fo T leave them, and take a View of Goa. Chap.246 A mm Account CHAP. XXI. Gives an Account of Goa its Situation^ Trade r Religion and Churches, with the Fortifications about it, the Limits of the Fortugueze 'Dominions there, as far South as Cabo de Rama. GO J, the Metropolis of India, under the Dominion of the Crown of Tortu- gal, ilands on an Ifland about iz Miles long, and 6 broad. The City is built on the North Side of it, on a Champain Ground, and has the Conveniency of a fine fait Water River, capable to receive Ships of the largeft Size, where they ly within a Mile of the Town. The Banks of the River are beautified with noble Structures of Churches, Caftles and Gentlemens Houfes; but, in the City, the Air is reckoned unwholfom, which is one Caufe why at prefent it is not well inhabited. The Vice-roy's Palace is a noble Edifice, flanding within Piftol Shot of the River, o- ver one of the Gates of the City, which leads to a fpacious noble Street, about half a Mile long, and terminates at a beautiful Church, called Mifericordia, The City contains ma ny noble Churches, Convents' and Cloifters, with a {lately large Hofpital, all well endow'd, and well kept. The Market-place flands near the Mifericordia Church, and takes up about an Acre fquare, where mod Things of the Produft of that Country are to be fold ; and., in the Shops about it, may be hadof the Eaft Indies. Z47 what Europe, China, Bengal, and othci Coun tries of Ms Note furnifli them with. Lvery Church has a Set of Bells, that one or other of them are continually ringing, and, being all chriftned, and dedicated to fome ^aint, thev have a fpecifick Power to drive away all Manner of evil Spirits, except Poverty in the Laity, and Pride in the Clergy; but, to thofe that are not ufed-to noaurnal Noiles, thev are very troublefom in the Nights. T e Vice-roy generally refides at the Powder- houfe, about two Miles below the City, on the River Side, the Springs of \\ ater there being reckoned the bell on the Ifland, is a Liquor very much efteemed by the Tor- tumeze, except when they can get \\ me or Spirits Coft free, and then they 11 drink to li(Xccfs. . i The Religion, eftablifted by Law, is tne ■Romifb, and here are the moft zealous Bigots of it; and the Laws of the Church (but not of their Country) are rigoroufly ol^ei- ved, and there is a fevere Inquilition Court to punifh any whom the Inquihtovs have tl -.c lead Sufpicion of, which aws both Clergy and Laitv to fuch a Complacency, tnat 1 qucltion if there is fuch a Pack of notorious Hypo crites in the World; and yet their Indian Converts, who go by the general Name ot Caw nartans, retain fo much of the r ancient nifl} Superllition, that they abftam from eat ing Cows Flefli, becaufe of the \ eneration paid to that Beaft, above others, by the tows, whofe Offspring they are. r Q 4 T here24^ new T here are many Gen tows dwell in the City, who cannot be brought to change their idolatrous Superftition for the Religion of owe, bur they are tolerated, becaufe they w e generally more indullrious than theC/^r/- Jiians, efpecially in mechanical Employments and Agriculture; but the mercantil Part of them are very fubjea to the Infults of the KpnOidS) or European Fidalgoes, who will ortcn buy their Goods, and never pay for rhem, which Cudom has alio crept into fome Countries better policed than the Tortu- gucze, only with fome Reflridions, that they dare not ufe l orce in taking what they have Uccafion for, as the Tortugueze dp, nor in^ corporal Puniihments on their Creditors, ivhen they ask for their Money, fo that it is dangerous for the poor induflrious Merchant* either to refufe their Goods, or ask for their Money when it is due, for Fear of a Bafli- riado in either Cafe, and fometimes worfe Confequences, which Abufes make the Cir culation of Trade very faint and weak. T he Clergy at Goa are very numerous and illitei ate, and are a very great Burden on the State. Their Churches are richly fur- mmed with fine Decorations and .Images, and, as I faid before, richly endow'd to mamtain the Luxury of a great Number of idle Drones. Their Houfes are large,and their Outfides magnificent; but within (like their Owners 1 leads; they are but poorly furnilht, and their lablcs very m^an. Green Fruits and Roots, inof the Eaft Indies. 24.9 in their Seafons, with a little Bread and Rice go far in their Diet; and candied and pre fer ved Fruits are their Regal'to in all Seafons. They have Hogs and Fowl plenty, but ufe them fparingly; and the Church feeds moil on Filh, but not miraculoully, for the poor Fifliers dare fell none till the Priefthood is firfl fer- ved, fo that the Laity moftly eat ftale or {linking Fifh. And the Soldiery, Fifhers, Peafants and Handicrafts feed on a little Rice boyled in Water, with a little Bit of fait Filh, or Atchaar^ which is pickled Fruits or Roots, and drink fair Water, when they can get it. This fine fpare Diet never loads them with fuperabundant Flefli on their Bones, and, without the Church, it is rare to find a corpulent Man among them. They are generally very weak and feeble, but whether that proceeds from their Diet, or from their too great Inclinations to Venery, or from both, I am not Phyfician enough to determine. Their Soldiers Pay is very fmall and ill paid. They have but fix Xerapheens per Month, and two Suits of Calico, ftript or chequered, in a Year.

Their Settlements were thick fet between Mozambique and Jap on ; and, as a Monument of their Grandeur then, their Language goes current along moft of the Sea-coait at this Time. Their infolent Pride and W ar with the &lt;r Dutch have brought them to the Poverty and Contempt they arc in, as I ftiall remark in their proper Places. The Muskat War, ( that has lafted fince the Arabs took that City from them ) tho* the longefl, has done them lead Harm, for it o- bliges them to keep an Armada of five or fix Ships, befides fmall Frigats and Grabs of War, which gives Bread to great Numbers of People, who otherwife would be much more burdenfom to the State,'by crowding into Churches. The Arabs and they have had many Encounters, but no great Damage done on either Side. I was Witnefs to one Engagement near Surat Bar, but it was not bloody. Theyof the Eaft Indies. 151 They alfo have had feveral Wars afhore, but the moft dangerous to the City of Goa, was that with Sevajee Rajah, who got toot ing on the Ifland about the Year 1685'. He raifed fome Batteries againft the Town, which would have annoyed it very much, had not a i Portugueze Heroine^ in a Sally, got into a Redoubt of the Enemy's, and cut them to Pieces, which llruck fuch a Terror into Sevajees Army, that they quitted their Polls and fled. The Lady was alive in Anno 1705-. and received the Pay of a Captain all her Days after that noble Exploit. She was cal led 'Donna Maria. She came 10 India in Man f s Apparel, in Queft of a Gentleman that had promifed her Marriage, and then deferted her, and went, in Quality of Cap tain, to India ; but Ihe found him, and chal lenged him at Sword and Piftol, but he ra ther chofe to make the Quarrel up amicably by Marriage. I have Hood on a little Hill near the City, and have counted about eighty Churches, Convents and Monafteries within View; and I was informed, that, in the City and its Di- ftrids, which ftretch about 40 Miles along the Sea-coaft, and Miles within Land, there are no fewer than 30000 Church Ver min, who live idlely and luxurioufly on the Labour and Sweat of the miferable Laity, fo that every Body that has Sons and Subftance, ftrives to buy Places for them in the Church, becaufe neither military nor civil Preferments can be expefted from the State, or if by Me-new Account lit they chance to raife themfelves, yet the Tyranny and Oppre/Tions of thedomineerino- Clergy is infupportable; for Inftance, I knew a Gentleman that bought a Parcel of frefh liih, and a Priell coming foon after to the rilliers, and finding that none was left for the Chinch, he demanded the Gentleman's Bargain, who excufed himfelf, by teltino- the Prielt, that he had fome Friends todine^with him, and could not fpare them. The Prieft gave him a Reprimand in fcurrilous Lan guage, and the Gentleman ufing fome tart Language to the Prieft, that offended him, he let fly the fharp Dart of Excommunicati on, that pierced him fo deep, that it coft him above 7 L.

Accordingly his Arm was fairly cut off by the Shoulder, and fent to Rome to (land its Trial. When his Holinefs had viewed it, he called for Pen, Ink and Paper to be brought on a Table, and the Ai m let near them. After a little Conjuration, in lull View of the facred College, who were there prefent, and no Body elie, the Saint s Hand took hold of the Pen, and dipt it in Ink, and fairly wrote Xavier. I take it to be a pretty Piece of Wax-work that ferves to gull the People of their Mo^ ney, for many vifit it with great Vencration, and leave fomething at its Shrine for the Maintenance of Candles and Olive Oyl, that continually burn before it: And a Priefl at tends weekly to lhave his Head and Beard; but none but that Prieft has the Honour to come within the Iron Rails that are placed about the Corps, four or five Yards dillant from it. Now if any Ihould queftion the Truth of Xavier's Story at Goa, they would be branded with the odious Name of an ob- ffinate incredulous Heretick, and perhaps fall in the Hands of a convincing Inquifition. But , if any incredulous Heretick Ihould befqueamiih, and cannot fwallow the Story of Xavier without chewing it, I will tell them ofZ54 new Account of another that doubtlefs will go glibly down. At a certain Time, but God knows when, a Ship of 'Portugal coming to hid'ta, got the Length of Cabo de bona Ejperanz,a, and then met with fuch a violent Storm, that drove the ohip fo violently before it, that it was pair the Pilot s Skill to keep her to Rights in a i and who 'hould come to their Aiiiltance in that critical Junfture, but Senhor Jjiabolo, who took the Helm, and managed it very dextroufly: And the Virgin Mary, to Jhevv her Kindncfs, and Skill in Navigation, itood a whole Night on the Forecaftle, dire- tting the Devil how he fhould fteer, and be- j 1° t o e .

The Church lave often feen as I pall up and down the Kiver. And this Story is fo firmly believed Doutaof h ^ ^ danserous t0 make any . Of all the Churches in or aboutGoa none nonbured with Glafs-windows, but one in tlie City dedicated to St. Alexander, for tne relt are all ferved with clear Oylter-lhell Lights, that are far inferior to Lights of Glafs.of the Eaft Indies. Glafs. And all their (lately Houfes are fur- niftied with Oylter-lhel Lights. The Country about Goa is fteril in Corn, but it produces fbme excellent Fruits. The Goa Mango is reckoned the largelt and moft delicious to the Talte of any in the World, and, I may add, the wholfomell and beft ta iled of any Fruit in the World. Their bo Malacca is very beautiful and pleafant, and they have very good Pine Apples and Melons. The little Trade they have, is moftly from their Arrack, which is diflilled from Toddy of the Cocoa-nut Tree, which grows in great Abundance in the Territories of Goa. The Enghjh are their bell Cullomers, for they buy great Quantities yearly for Punch. It is fold by the Candy, or two Casks, about 45* Gallons each, for Xerapheens fer Cask; but I have bought it for 20. when there was no great Demand for it. They alfo make a great Deal of Salt in Ponds made in low Grounds, where they may convey the Wa ter at fpring Tides. It may be bought for a Crown the Tun, and fometimes cheaper. The River's Mouth is guarded, and the Entrance defended by feveral Forts and Bat teries, well planted with large Cannon on both Sides. On the Illand is the black Fort, which Hands within half a Musket-fliot of the Bar, which is fhut up by the South-fouth- weil Monfoons, from April to Sept ember y when is St. Anthonys New-moon, as they call being the firll New-moon in September. The Freihes coming down from the Moun tains,Z5^ A new Account tains, carry off the Sands, which choke the Mouths of the Rivers along all the Coafts of India. And, without the black Fort, is a Battery built clofe to the Sea on a little Pro- montory, called Nos Senhor de Cabo, about a Mile without the black Fort. And, juft o- ver that Battery, on a little Hill about 40 Yards high, is a fine Monallery, always kept as white as Snow, and may be feen a o-ood Diftance off at Sea. The Monaitery has a large pleafant Garden towards the Land, and an Orchard of excellent Fruit Trees. And, on the Oppofite of ISlos Senhor de Qabo^ is a fort built on the Face of a little Hill, which commands that Side of the River. And, with out that, is the Afrnada) fortified with a Fort on its Top, and feveral Batteries at the Foot of its high Grounds, which are alfo about 40 Yaids high. In the Caftle is placed a large Lantern for a Light-houfe, to lliew Ship ping the Way into the Road about the Be ginning o'i September , when thick Clouds ob- cuie the Land, that it cannot be well known at Sea. All Boats that are bound to the Ci ty, are obliged to call at Aguada^ to give an Account from whence they came, and what their Bufinefs is; and if any prefume to pafs without calling there, they arefure of a Shot hred from a Battery at them, to put them in Mind of their Duty.

River of St. Lorenzo, which is a Branch of Coa River, parting about five Leagues from their Mouths, and compofe the Ifland cal led Goa Ifland. This Country belonged formerly to the Kin^s of Vifapore ; but in the fifteenth Cen tury, when Albukerk fettled the Tortn^ueze Colonies in India, he purchafed the lilands of Goa and Salfet, which lie contiguous to Goa, from the King, who did them many Angular Services, which afterwards were re paid by Ingratitude. „ , About the Year r66o. when the had a War in America and India, with the Tortueue&amp;e, the 'Dutch fent a Squadron, to try if they could add G to the rell ot theif Indian Conquefts, but found its Avenues fo well fortified, that it Was thought impracti cable to land. Their Ships were forced to ly at a good Diftance from and A os Senhor de Cabo, and fo continued riding at Anchor triumphantly, without Action, ex cept a little Diverfion they had with a 'Por- tu'jueze Bravo, who, with a fmall Ship of forty Guns, would needs pafs thro'the Fleet, as they lay at Anchor ; but they toon made him fenfible of rafli Folly, by finking his Ship, and either killing or drowning him and all his Crew. , , „ • When the TortugUeze and the Sevajee had War, I think that Conde de Villa Verde was then Vice-roy, there were fo few Soldi ers, and fo many Priefts, that he was oblig-- ed to take Recruits for his Army, out of the j R Church j258 A new Church ; but the King of ^Portugal was for* ced to recal him for that great Offence. . Between Goa and Salfet there is a little River that is another Branch of the River of Goa, which difembogues about a League to the South of Marmagun, at a Village called Bangricoaly and affords a little Harbour for fmall Veffels, from which Place the Illand of Salfet Itretches five Leagues along the Sea- lliore, in a fine level Plain, planted with Co coa-nut Trees and Churches. The Produd: of this Ifland is as that of Goa, Arrack and Salt. The Churches and Monaiteries are Se minaries for black Rom'tjh Prieits, and the Country, befides them, produces good Store of Hogs and Poultry. At Cabo de Rama, which is contiguous to Salfet, are the Li mits of the Dominions of the Tortugucze on that Part of India. 44444444 i f4 , 4444444 44^4444^4444444444444444' ! f!i chap . xxn. : 1 Gives an Account of the Sundah RajahV 7)^- minions, the 'Produff.

But, Carwar, which lie^ feven Leagues to the Southward of Cape Ramus^ has the Ach cin- taees of a good Harbour, on the O outh Side of a Bay, and a River capable to re ceive Ships of 300 Tuns. The EngliJio\\^\ T Q a Fadory here, fortified with two Baltions, and fome fmall Cannon for its Defence. The Rajah is tributary to the Mogul at^preient, but formerly was a Part oiV'ifapore s pomi' nions, before Aurengzeh conquered that Country. This Rajatts Dominions reach from Cape Ramus to Merzee, about fifteen Leagues along the Sea-coaft, and fixty 01 v.- venty Leagues within Land. About the Year 1660. Aurengzeh came into Vifapore with an Army of 3 4 0OC00 Men, and foon conquered the open Country, but the Metropolis, called the City or / tja- porey took him feven or eight ^ ears t0 ie ' duce it, for being built on a flat Mountain or difficult Accefs, and Room enough to fow Corn on it, obliged Aurengzeb to furround it with his Army^ and make a Blockade, but at laft it yielded, and Aurengzeb the King in Chains of Silver, and carried him m Triumph along with his victorious Army, near the Space of thirty ^iears, and then he died an inglorious Captive. He was recko ned a good fimple peaceable Prince while he reigned, but was in no Way related to the God Mars. ^ t R ^ Th «160 A new Account The Sundah Rajah's Country is mountain ous, and lies on both Sides of the Mountains of Gatti. The Vallies abound in Corn and Pepper, the beft in India ; and the Woods, on the Mountains, with many Sorts of wild Beafls, as Tigers, Wolves, Monkies, wild Hog, Deer, Elks, and wild Cattle of a prodi gious large Size. I have feen a wild Bull killed there, whofe four Quarters weighed above a Tun Weight, befides the Hide, Head and Guts. I meafured his Horns, which were not long in Proportion to their Thicknefs, being twenty three Inches in Cir cumference about the Roots, and his Mar row-bones fo large, that I took the Marrow out with an ordinary Silver-fpoon. The Flefh was not fo favoury as that of fmall tame Cattle, nor would it take Salt kindly, but grew hard, dry and black when falted. This Country is fo famous for hunting, that two Gentlemen of Diilinftion, e utz. Mr. Lcmbourg of the Houfe of Lembourg in Ger many, and Mr. Goring, a Son of my Lord Gorings in England, went incognito in one of the Eaft-india Company's Ships, for India. They left Letters directed for their Relati ons, in the Hands of a Friend of theirs, to be delivered two or three Months after their Departure, fo that Letters of Credit follow ed -them by the next Year's Shipping, with Orders from the Eafl-india Company to the Chiefs of the Factories, where ever they fliould happen to come, to treat them according to their Quality. They fpent three Years atof the Eaft Indies. l($i Cavwar^ viz. {xoxviAnno 1678. to 1681. then, being tired with that Sort of Pleniure, they both took Paflage on board a Company's Ship for England, but Mr. Goring died four Days after the Ship's Departure from Carwar, and lies buried on the Ifland St. Mary, about four Leagues from the Shore, oft Batacola, and Mr. Liewbourv returned fafe to England, There are three Species of Tigers in Car war Woods. The fmaUell is the fierceft. It is not above two Foot high when it walks. It is very cunning, and delights much in hu man Flefli. The fecond Sort is about three Foot high, and hunts Deer and wild Hog, and a little Creature, called a PilTay. Its Body has the Shape of a Deer's, but its Head like a Swine; and, as a Boar has two long Tusks growing upward from the nether Jaw, fo it has two long fmall fharp Teeth which grow downward from the upper Jaw, and reach as low as the under Part oi the lou er Jaw. They are very harmlefs and tearful, and feed on Grafs and Herbs. They are hardly fo big as a full grown Cat, and their Flefh is black, and taftes like an Hare's. The largeft Size of the Tigers is above three Foot and anhalfhigh, when they walk. They are lefs rapacious than the others, feldom greedy of human Flelh, and fooner frightned. A poor Peafant in this Country had a Buffa lo bemired in a Bog, and while he went to his Neighbours for Afliflance, came a large Tiger that faved them the Trouble, for he pulled it out by his own Dexterity and R 3 Strength,idz A new Account Strength, and, when he had done, threw him over his Shoulder, as a Fox does a Goofe, and was carrying it, with its Feet upwards, to his Den, but, when he faw the People, he let it fall, and went away; but he had killed the Buffalo, and had fuckt his Blood. ( Tis a fmall Buffalo that weighs not above 500 lb. Weight, and fome weigh noo. 1 once was in the Woods with my Fuzee, to try if I could kill a Deer, but a fmall Rain happened to fall that damped my Powder, which was only wrapt up in Paper; and, my Gun being ulelefs, I was making towards the Plain where our Fa^ory ftands, and falling on a Foot-path from the Mountains towards the Plain, I kept in that Road, and had not gone far, till I efpied a Tiger of the largeft Size {landing in the lame Path, with his Pace towards me. Ailbon as he faw me, he fquat- ted his Belly to the Ground, and wagged his Tail, and crawled flowly towards me. I thought it would be in vain to flee, fo I ilept leiftirely forward, till 1 came within ten Yards of him, I then clubbed my Fuzee, and made what Noife I could to frighten him, and he, out of Civility, ruflit in amongft a Thicket of Buflies, and left me the Road, which I did not think fit to accept of, but got in among the Buflies on the oppofite Side to him (I dare fay) much more frightned than he was. And, before I got to the Plain, I faw a wild Bull and a Cow grazing. The Bull grew angry, and fnorted, but the Co\v only gazed on 5 but I (oon got out orvf the Eaft Indies. z6$ their Sight, and got fafe to the Faflory; but never went into the W oods again, but with a numerous Company. The Chief of the Engltjh Faftory is held in very great Efteem in this Country, and when he goes a hunting, is generally accom panied with molt Part of the People of Di- ftinftion in the Vicinage, who bring their Vallals and Servants with them, armed with fire Arms and other Weapons, both mif- five and defenfive, with Trumpets, Haut boys and Drums. The fire Men place them- felves at convenient Diftances, along the Skirts of an Hill or a Wood, except feme that are fent in to guard thofe who arc fent with their loud Mufick to rouze the Game. The Drums, Trumpets and Hautboys fpread themfelves fometimes for a Mile or two, and, on a Signal given, ftrike up at once, and march towards the Skirt where the fire Men are placed. The wild inhabitants being aftoniihed with the unufual Noife, betake themfelves to their Heels, and fall in the Am^ bufcade, and many of them are killed and wounded in their Flight. I law, in one of thefe Huntings, above a Dozen of Deer kil led, two wild Cows with their Calves^ who w T ould not leave their dead Parents, tho' they had done fucking; alfo four or five Sows, who had above a Dozen of Pigs following them, and were all killed, with fome PifTays; and all in lefs than two Hours Space. The Hun ters made good Cheer of what they lik'd bell, and what remained was fent to the Factory; R 4 andz6i$ A nm Account ^nd the Chief foon following after, was con» durted Home by the whole Company, and, at the Fadory Gate, made him a Complin ment, and departed. At this Time, which was in Anno 1692,. the Factory had about a Score of good Dogs for Game, of Englifh Brood, and the Company allowed each of them about x lb. of boyl'd Rice daily, but now they are better Husbands of their Mo ney, and have difcharged all their Dogs and other Superfluities, except one good old Cu- llom of treating Strangers that come there from Europe^ with pretty black female Dan-' cers, who are very aftive in their Dancing, and free in their Converfationj where Shame is quite out of Fafhion. The Woods produce great Quantities of good leak Timber, ufcful in building both 6hips and Houfes. It is more durable than Oak. And there is good Poon Malls, Wronger, but heavier than Fir. There is a Shrub grows in the Woods, that has a Leaf bigger than that of the Fig-tree; and the Dew that falls on that Leaf being carefully gathered, and fet in the Sun a Day or two, becomes the pleafantell and ftrongeft Acid that ever I tafted. Before Aurengzeh conquered Vifapore, this Country produced the fineft BetCeellas or Muflins in India. The Englijh Company had a great Cloth Trade here, and employed a- bout 5-0000 People in that Manufactory; but the Mogul's licentious Soldiers fell into this Province, ^nd ruined all Manner of Trade, pluib!of the Eaft Indies. 165 plundring the indultrious Inhabitants of all they could lay Hands on, and cut the Com pany's Cloth from the Loom, and ufed the Weavers fo rudely, that they left their own Country, to look For Protection in Countries farther to the Southward, where War had not fet up her bloody Banners. Pc _ _ mice in his Mafler's Name, he invited the Gentlemen of the En-* glijh Fadory to an Entertainment in his Tent, under Pretence of fettling the Com^ pany's Commerce, and, while they were at Dinner, he fent a Party of Men, who plun- dred and burnt their Houfe, which made the Company build and fortify what they now have; but he who built it where it is, had no great Forefight inchoofinghis Ground, for it ought to have been built in a Place of free Communication with the Sea, but now it (lands a League from it. And, in Anno 1718. the Rajah Ihewed them their Error, and built Batteries at the Mouth of the River, fo that the Faftory is nothing at prefent but a gen tile Prifon, which by dear bought Experience, we found in a War we had with him, by the Indifcretion of one Taylor who was Chief, who pretended to be Lord of the Mannor, in appropriating a Wrack to his own Ufe, that was call away above four Miles from the Faftory. The Rajah could not bear to be fo bare-fae'dly affronted in his own Domi nions, by Tenants that would hear no Rea- fon. He befiegcd the Faftoiy fov x Months General had takfn before166 *A ne-ia Account before the Seafon would admit of Forces co ming to affift them by Sea; and when they arrived, the Seas run fo high on the Shore, that there was great Difficulty of landing in the Teeth of an Enemy, who had ten Times our Numbers, fo that the firlt At- tgnpt of landing was unfuccefsful, by our JVtens Negleft and Difobedience to the Or- ders they had received, and about fourfcore of our braveft Fellows were cut off, and fome taken Prifoners: But, about fix Weeks after, we had fome Revenge on the Enemy in an Engagement on the Side of an Hill among thick Bullies. The Enemy being above our Men, began their Fire at Break of Day, to beat our Men from a Spring of frefh Water clofe to the Sea ; but our fmall VefTels lying near the Shore to cover about 400 Men, that lay to guard the Water, fired with fo good Succefs, that, in an Hour's Time, they were obliged to run, and leave near 2,00 dead m the Woods; and our Men purfuing them in their Flight, did fome Execution on them. We were in daily Expeftation of more Forces, and did not offer the Enemy Battle, becaufe of their Numbers and our Want of Experience; but we haraffed the Enemies in the Nights, in burning Villages, for there was little to plunder; and at Sea we took fome Velfels laden with Salt going to the E- pemy, and three Ships of the Rajah's com ing from Arabia with Horfes, to the Num ber of 140. which created us much Trouble to find Provender and Water for them \ How ever,of the Eaft Indies. 167 ever, when our Reinforcement came, we could mufter, in our Fleet, of Seamen and Soldiers, ixyoMen. The Enemy raifedfome Batteries on the Strand to lynder our land ing ; and we took two of the Prizes, and made them Shot-proof above Water, and laid them afliore at high Water to batter their Batteries, and keep the Enemy at a Diltance with their great Shot, till our Men were landed and drawn up. Each of our floting Batteries were covered with a Frigat of 2.0 or ^4 Guns. When all was ready, we land ed ixyo Men, without the leaft Hindrance from the Enemy, for they were preparing to flee to the Woods; but our frelli Water land Officers were fo long a drawing up their Men in a confounded hollow Square, that the Enemy took Courage, and, with Horfe and Foot, came running towards our Men, firing, and wounding fome as they marched in their Ranks, which our Commandant fee ing, pulled off his red Coat, and vaniflied. Some other as valiant Captains as he, took Example, and left their Pofts, and then the Soldiers followed, and threw down their Arms. We loll in this Skirmilh about 2,5-0. but our floting Batteries would not permit the Enemy to purfue far, nor duril they Hay to gather up our fcattered Arms, fo about 80 Sailers went on the Field of Battle, and brought on board of the Commodore about icoStand ofArms, moft of them loaded: How ever the Enemy had fome Lofs too, for wo found eleven Horfes dead, and faw many Fires alopg -f'iz68 A nemo Account long the Foot of the Hills to burn their dead Men in. T he Rajah had, by this Time, 7000 Men engaged in this War, which Expence he be gan to be tired of, and the Lofs of his Ships and Horfes was fome Mortification to him, befides the had made an Inroad in to his Northern Borders, which made him in cline very much towards a Peace, and accor dingly he fent a Brahman on board the Commodore of the Fleet, to negotiate about a Peace. The Commodore heard him, and advifed him to make his Overtures to Mr. Taylor ; but he faid, that the Rajah would by no Means confent to treat with him, com plaining, that he was not only the Occafion of that War, but even, before the War, had done fome Detriment to him and his Sub jects, for receiving the Company's Pepper a- bove 100 Miles from the Factory. He made the Servants that went to receive the Pepper, take certain Quantities to fell out by Retail in his Villages, to the utter Ruin of many poor Inhabitants, that had no other Way to get their Livelihood, but by huckilering, and becaufe the Company's Agreement with his Forefathers and himfelf, gave them a free Trade in all his Dominions, he paft all over, but was forced to relieve the poor Botickeers or Shop-keepers, who before could pay him Taxes; however we being tired of War as well as he, by the Mediation of a Se 'id^ who was a Friend to both Parties, in ten Days ^fter the fir ft Overture was made; Peace wasof the Eaft Indies. z6g proclaimed on eafy Terms for both Par ties. There is one Trick that the Priefts year ly put upon the People in this Country, that would puzzle the bell Merry-andrews in Eu~ rofe to imitate, and that is, about the latter End of May, or the Beginning of June, there is a Fealt celebrated to the infernal Gods, with a Divination or Conjuration to know the Fate of the enfuing Crop of Corn. The Ceremony I faw here, and at other Places on the Coafl of Canara. The Priefts having perfwaded fome Fools to bear a Part in the Farce, proclaim the Feaft to be on fuch a Day, at a certain Grove, where leveral thou- fands of People afTemble, and in the Middle of the Grove is placed a black Stone of ^ or 400 Weight, without any defigned Shape, but fome Places bedaub'd with red Lead mixt in Oyl, to ferve for a Mouth, Eyes and Ears, and a little earthen Pot of Fire placed before the Stone, and a Girl about ten Years of Age to attend it. Some Priefts, all naked, except a Bit of Cloth to hide their Privities, run and dance round the Stone and Fire for half an Hour, like mad Men, making ftrange Diftortions in their Phizes, and now and then bellowing like Calves. And this was the firfl Scene. Thofe Priefls had ereded a Scaffold on two Axle-trees, that had Trucks fitted for them like the Carriage of Ship Guns. In the Middle of the Scaffold ( which might be about 15- Foot long, and as broad) was ereded aPiece of 4'Vjo A new Account of Wood about ij Foot high, with a Notch cut in the upper End, like the Cheeks of a Ship's Pump, with Holes bored for a Bolt to pafs through, as Pump Cheeks have. A Tree hewn for their Purpofe, about 40 Foot long, was laid about the Middle in the Notch, and a Bolt pafling through the Cheeks and that Tree, like a Pump-brake. At one End of the Tree were placed two crofs Pieces, one at the very End, and the other about 4 Foot within it. Each of thofe crofs Pieces were about 4 Foot long, and, at the other End, had a Rope faftned to it. And this was the Vehicle for the Adors to hang on for a Mile or two. The Aftors prefenting themfelves to the Priefls, being four in Number, dreft as the Priefts were; only on their Heads, Crowns were made round their Temples, of Sugar cane Leaves, open at the Top, like ducal Crowns. The Priefts brought two Tenter hooks, fuch as the Butchers in Britain hang their Meat on, for each Ador, and, after lome ridiculous Ceremony, hookt them 011 each Side of the Back-bone, a little above the Kidnies. Thofe Hooks had Cords fall to them, fo they went dancing round the Stone, and the Priefl holding their Strings faft, and, after two Minutes Dancing, they came tamely to the End of the Tree, where the crofs Pieces were faftned, and one was tied up to each End of the crofs Pieces, and the Mob was ready to hale down the other End, and failned it to the End of the Scaf-r&gt;f the Eaft Indies. 2.71 fold, and the foolifli Fellows were hung up by the Back, above ten Yards from the Ground. The Populace broke fome old Cocoa-nuts on the Scaffold, and fome hundreds of them got hold of the Ropes fattned to the Scaf fold, and haled it over plowed Ground,, a- bove a Mile, to another Grove; and the Girl with the Pot of Fire on her Head, walking all the Way before. When they came to the End of their Journey, they were let down, and going into the Grove, where was placed another black Stone Pagod, the Girl fet her Fire before it, and run Hark mad for a Mir- nute or two, and then fell in a Swoon, and in that ihe lay fweating and foming at the Mouth prodigioufly. When ihe grew mad, the Men fell flat on the Ground before the Image, and then arofe after flie fell in her Trance. She continued immoveable about a Quarter of an Hour, and then awoke, and feemed to be very fick. The Prieils inter rogated her about what fhe had feen and heard from the terreftrial Gods, and ihe gave them a fatisfaftary Anfwer, on which they all bowed to the Image, and put their Hand on a Cow that was there ready, dedicated to the Image; and fo all departed fatisfied. O n fight of the new Moon in Augttft they have another Piece of Superilition, in a Feafl dedicated to the Sea, for the prolperous Na vigation of the enfuing Seafon. They have the Effigies of the God Gunnies^ which is a Man's Body, with an Elephant's Head, clapc cleverly on his Shoulders, and carried in Pro- cefiioaiyi A new Account ceflion to a River's Side, and thrown into the River, upon which, all Rivers who have Bars are opened for Navigation. This Gunnies was Son to Ram another God, who had a great War many Years with a certain Sort of gigantick Devils, that in- fulted the Land, and carried away all the Virgins they could lay their Paws on; at Length overcame them in a bloody Bat tle, for which Succefs, he fwore, he would make a Sacrifice of the firil living Creature he Ihould meet in his own Dominions,to the great God of Heaven; and poor Gunnies was the firft Objeft that prefented himfelf; for being a good loving Son, came on Purpofe to meet and welcome his Father from his Fatigues in War: You may judge what a Pack of Trou bles Ram was in, but there was no Remedy, but Gunnies mull: die; and, with great Re gret, he was about to have his Head ftruck off, when a clever Fellow of a Brahman Do ftor came, and told Ram, that by his Art he could fave Gunnies's Life, if his Advice might be followed, which Ram promifed to do, on which the Dodor ordered a young Elephant to be brought; and when the Father whipt off his Son's Head, the Doftor very skilful ly cut off the Elephant's at one Stroke, and nimbly fet it on Gunnies's Shoulders, to the great Admiration of all the Beholders; and from that Day to this, Gunnies has wore an Elephant's Head. . - .

In the Space ot three \ears no Eiiglijh Ship from Europe had called there, and the Gentlemen longing for one, and Moam But coming to vifit the Chief, Mr. Watfil askt him if he could tell when a Ship from Eu rope would call there. He anfwered, he could tell, and mufinga little While, told, that on that fame Day forty Days, which happened to fall out on a Sunday, one would arrive, and that fhe was, at that Time, at Anchor at an Illand on this Side of the Cape of Good- hope, taking in Refreshments; The Chief told him, it he prophefied true, he would prefent him with as much fcarlet Cloth as would make him a Coat. The But anfwer ed, that he thank 'd him, but that neither of them would live to fee her arrive, and there fore advifed Mr. TValfel to fet his Houfef in Order; and that, fo prove fome Part of the Prophecy true, the But himfelf fhould die ten Days after the Day he prophefied, and that Mr. JValfel Ihould die fo many Days af ter. Accordingly the But died, which put the other's Mind out of Order, till the Day of his Death came, and that Morning Mr. Walfel laid, he believed the Conjurer was out in his Reckoning, for he never was iri better Health in his Days; but, after Dinner, he had an apoplecliek Fit, that carried him • 1 . «■ m274 ^ ■ / ^ ccomi off. And the Ship's Pinnace came afliore at the Factory Gate that Noon that the But told Hie Ihould arrive. The Ship was the Mexico Merchant, commanded by Captain Rocer Taxton^ whom I well knew. The pretty nimble female Dancers at Car- war are not fo by Choice ; but all Trades and Occupations being lifted into Tribes, none can marry out of their own i ribe; and, as it fortuned, the Originals of this I ribe were Ladies that could not be confined to one Husband, and io would not marry. Their Poilerity are not fuffered to marry, be- caufe there are no Men in their Tribe allow ed. When the LafTes bring forth Children, the Males are brought up Soldiers, and the Females are learned to dance, and what they earn by dancing goes to the Raj ah ^ excepu a fmall Share for the ^ Girl's Maintenance. What they get by their Kindnefs to Stran gers is all their own; and I have feen iome have very fine Clothes and Jewels acquired by their Trade. The Tortugueze have an Ifland called Anjediva (before mentioned) about x Miles from Batcoal. They fortified it, for fear that Muskat Arabs or the Sevajees Ihould have fettled on it; if they had, they might have incommoded the Goa Fleet that goes yeaily to Canara for Corn. • ^ At the Mouth of C^rz^r River, are two fortified Iflands, called Shipe and Gur. One is fortified by Walls built round it, and fome Guns mounted on it. The other is iteril and dry,of the Eaft Indies. 27^ dry, and not worth walling. They both belong to the Rajah of Sundah. There are fome 1- flandsly athwart the Mouth of the Bay, that make the Harbour of Carwar, but none in habited. The Bay has two large Entrances for Shipping. That to the North is clear from Danger; but the South Chanel has a fliarp Rock like a Pyramid in the Middle of it^ that feveral large Ships have (truck on, for there is too much Water on it for fmall Ships to be frightned by it, having at leaft Foot Water on its Top. There are feveral more little Harbours in this Rajah's Dominions to the Southward of Carzvar, viz, Ankla^ Cuddermuddy and Merzeey whofe River terminates the Stin* dab's Territories^ and brings us on to a bet ter Country, viz. Qanara, CHAP. XXIIL Gives a &lt; Dcfcription of Canara, Jhewmg its Fertility, c Produ6f- t Government, Religion^ Cufloms, and Temper of its Inhabitants. ONOAR is its northermoft Port, and has the Benefit of a River, capable to receive Ships of 2 or 300 Tuns. It has a Caftle on a low Hill, about a Mile within the Bar, built, of old, by the Tortuguezei when they were Lords Paramount of all the Sea-coalls of India \ but the Rajah of Cana ra was fo affronted by them, that he laid ~ | S 2. Sieg^i~]6 A new A Seigc to the Caftle, but was three Years in reducing it; and fo long he bloekt it up, till Hunger forced a Surrender. The Religion, by Law eilablifhed) here, as well as in Sundah^ is the 'Pagan. And there is a Pagod or Temple, called Ramtrut, that is vifited yearly by great Numbers of Pilgrims. Clofe by the Temple there is a fine Ciltern or Tank, of a fquare oblong Fi gure. It is continually furnilhed with good Water, that gullies out of the Face ot a Rock, as big as a Man's Thigh. There are about 50 Steps cut out of the fame Rock, that lead from the Surface of the Earth down to the Tank-, and at the Foot ot the Stairs is a little Summer-houfe built. The Tank is a- bout three Fathoms deep in the Middle, and is llored with Plenty of pretty brown Fifti, with a white Stroke from their Head to Tail, on each Side of the Back-bone. And when any mufical Inilrument is played on by the Sides of the Tank, they come in fuch Num bers towards the Mufick, that they may be taken up in Baskets; but none dare meddle with them, becaufe they are confecrated to the Pagod. SoMEtiMES they carry the Image of the Pagod in ProcelFion. In Figure he is more like a Monkey than a Man. They put him into a Coach in Form of a Tower, with a pyramidal Top about Foot high, where eight or ten Prielts are fet to bear the Image Company, and to fing his Prailes. The Coach has four Wheels, and a Rope of aof the Eaft Indies. Z77 good Thicknefs made faft to it, and drawn through the Streets 1 by Strength of Hand, with a great Mob attending his Godihip, wherever he is drawn. I n Canara there are feveral Cuftoms pecu liar to itfelf, and many of them are fpread a- broad to remote Countries. Here it was, that the Cuftom of Wives burning on the fame Pile with their deceaft Husbands had its Beginning. It is reported, that before the Brahmans invented this Law 7 , Poifon was fo well known and praffifed, that the leaft Quar rel that happened between a married Couple, colt the Husband his Life, and this Law put a great Stop to it; and now Cuftom fo far prevails, that if any fainted-hearted Lady has not Courage enough to accompany her Spoule to the other World, Ihe is forthwith fhaved and degraded, and obliged to ferve all her Husband's Family in all Kinds of Drudgery. I have feen feverals burned feveral Ways. In this Country they dig a Pit about 10 I 1 oot long, and 6 broad, and fill it with Logs of Wood. One great Piece is fet at the Brim of the Pit, ready to fall down on pulling a Bit of String. When all is ready, there is good Store of Oyl or Butter thrown on the Wood, and then the Husband's Corps is pla ced about the Middle of the Pile, and Fire fet to it, which blazes in an Inilant. ( hen the Spoule took her Leave of all Friends and Acquaintances, and Drums, Trumpets and Hautboys being playing cheerfully, Ihe wal ked three or four limes round the Pile, S 3 which,ryS A nenso Account which, by this Time, was all in a great Blaze, and then leaps in on the Corps. Alfoon as ever ihe leapt in, a Prieft drew the String, and down fell the great Log of W ood, at leafl 500 Pound Weight, over her Body, and all confumed together. I n other Parts they do not ufe Pits, but a Pile is built, and the Corps laid on it, and Fire put to it; and theViftim dancing round it for a little Time, to the Noife of loud Mufick, leaps in; and, if ilie helitates, the Priells thruft her in with long Poles, making i'uch an hideous Noife, that flie cannot be heard; and, all the While ihe is a burning, the Priefts dance round the Fire. Others a- gain take fomnifick Medicines, and Hand by the Pile till they fall on it while aileep. I heard a Story of a Lady that had received Addref- fes from a Gentleman, who afterwards de- ferted her, and her Relations obliged her to marry another, who died Ihortly after the Marriage, and who, according to Cuflom, was laid on the Pile; and, as the Fire was well kindled, and fhe going to aft the Tragedy on herfelf, Hie efpied her former Admirer, and beckned to him to come to her. When he came, Ihe took him in her Arms, as if Ihe had a Mind to embrace him; but, being ftronger than he, fhe carried him into the Flames in her Arms, where they both con- fumed, with the Corps of her Husband : \ et i have known fome faint-hearted Girls that had not the Courage to accompany their Spoufes into an unknown World, but ratherof the Eaft Indies. 179 live in this, tho' under the Badge and Um brage of Ignominy and Shame. This Country of Canara is generally go verned by a Lady, who keeps her Court at a Town called Bay dour &gt; two Days Journey from the Sea. She may marry whom flie pleafes ; but her Husband never gets the Title of Rajah, tho' if Hie has Sons, the el- deft of them does; but neither Husband nor Son have any Thing to do with the Manage ment of the Government, while ihe lives. Nor are the Queens obliged to burn with their Husbands. The Subjects of this Coun try obferve the Laws fo well, that Robbery or Murder are hardly heard of among them And a Stranger may pafs through the Coun try without being askt where he is going, or what Bufinefs he has. N o Man is permitted in this Country to ride on Horfes, Mules or Elephants, but Of ficers of State, or Troopers, tho' we are al lowed to ride on Oxen or Buffaloes: Nor none are permitted to have Umbrellas carri ed over them by Servants, but mtift carry them themfelves if the Sun or Rain offend them ; but in all Things elfe there is Liber ty and Property. The next Sea -port, to the Southward of Onoar, is Batacola, which has the Veftigia of a very large City, (landing on a little River, about four Miles from the Sea. There is nothing of it left now worth noticing, but ten or eleven imall Pagods or Temples co vered with Copper and Stone. The Coun- S 4 try2oO A new Account try produces good Quantities of Pepper ; and the hugltjh Company liad a Fattoi y there ; Jim, about the Year 1670. an Ship commg there to lade, had a fine EnMh null-dog, which the Chief of the Factory oi the Captain. A 1 1 er the Ship was gone, the Fadory, Which confifled of eighteen Perfons, were go^ng a hunting, and carried the Bull-dos u ith rhcni; ,anrf, palHng through the Town, the Dog feized a Cow devoted to a Pasod, ^nd killed her. L pon which the Priefls raifed z Mob, who murdered the whole Fadory • but lome Natives, that were Friends to the , made a large Grave, and buried them all in it. The Chief of Carwar fent a pepne to he put on the Grave, with an In- Icnption, That this is the Eur'uil-place of Jonn nei£, with feventeen other Englilh Men % ' Z ere j f acri f lced t0 th e f ury of a mad 1 rtefthoed, and an enraged Mob, The Envlifh refettled there lince ; but often buy Pepper there. The Ifland St. Mary lies H cit-north-weft from the Mouth of the Ri- icr oi Baiacola, about four Leagues diilant being the Burial-place of Mr. Gor 'm? before obierved. There are fome more lllands ly- jt'g cjoic 10 the Shore, but are befet with Hocks under Water. And what Ships pafs jetween St. Mary and them, ought not to venture above two Miles within that Illand ; our tr^reis no Ranger within a Quarter of JVJuc o. it, but what is vilible. \ ■* M - . ■ . 4. Theof Indies. 281 The next Town, to the Southward of Batacola, is Barceloar^ (landing on the Banks of a broad River, about four Miles from the Sea. The Country abounds in Rice, having in many Places two Crops in a Year, by the Advantage they have of fome Lakes at the Feet of the Mountains of Gat- ti, whofe Waters being confined by Sluces, are let out at convenient Times to water their Rice Fields. The Dutch have a Fa- dory here, only to buy up Rice for their Garifons on the Malabar Coaft. It (lands a- bout a Mile from the River's Mouth, that has a Bar of 13 or 14 Foot Water on it at fpring Tides, and has a Caille on its North Side for its Guard, that none may go in or out without Leave. The Tortugueze alfo get Supplies of Rice for Goa, and they have fix or eight Ships belonging to Barceloar^ that carry their Car goes of Rice to Muskaty and bring baqk in Returns, Horfes, Dates, Pearl, and other Merchandize of the Produd of Arabia. To the Southward of this Place, on a plain Road that leads to Mangulore, are planted four Rows of Trees, on the Sides ot a Walk about eight or ten Miles long, which being very large, and having fpreading Branches ever green all the Summer, ferve for Umbrellas to PafTengers that travel that Road. And, on feveral Places, there are Flurs built, where fome old People (lay in the Day -time, with Jars of fine clear Water for the Paffengersto, drink gratis^ at the Charge of the State. Bac- canoariSi A neiso A Kl camar and Molkey ly between Barceloar and Manpdore^ both having the Benefit of Ri vers to export the large Quantities of Rice that their Fields produce. Mangulore is the greateft Mart for Trade in all the Canard Dominions. It has the Con- veniency ofoneRiver produced by three that come into it by different Ways, 'viz. from the North, South and Laft, all proceeding from the great Rains and Dews that fall from the Mountains of Gatti, which ly 25* or 30 Leagues up in the Country, and are the in land Bounds of the Canara Dominions. Thofe three Rivers joyn about a Mile from the Sea, and, at Mangulore, difembogue at one Mouth into the common Receptory of Ri vers. The ( Portugueze have a Factory for Rice here, and a pretty large Church, becaufe great Numbers of black Chriftians refide there. The Priefls, as well as their Congre gations, are the very Scum of Chrifiianity, The Clergy are fo fhamelefs, that they will bargain with a Stranger to pimp for him. And the Laity look on Whoring, Thieving and Murder as no Sin, if any Gain can be got by them. T h e Fields here bear two Crops of Corn yearly in the Plains; and the higher Grounds produce Pepper, Bettlenut, Sandal-wood, I- ron and Steel, which make Mangulore a Place of pretty good Trade. The Town is poorly built, along the Sides of the Rivers, and has no Defence againft an Enemy, but twoof the Eaft Indies. z8 J two fmall Forts, one on each Side of the River's Mouth. The Rajah or Rana keeps generally about 15-000 Soldiers on their Malabar Frontiers, to repel the Infolence of the Malahars, and another Army towards the Sevajee Borders, to cover them from the In roads of thofe Harpies-, for the Malabarx and Sevajees being poor in refpeft of the Canarines, watch Opportunities to borrow the Superfluities of their rich Neighbours. Such Praftices have been ufed, in former Times, amongflus in Britain^ and, no Doubt, would ftill be fo, if good wholfom Laws, backt with good Forces to fee them put in Execution, did not reftrain us. Along the Malabar Frontiers, the Ca- nar'tnes have Forts built of Earth, wherein are kept about ^ or 300 Soldiers ready, on all Occafions, to encounter any fmall Party of the Malabars that clandeftinely come in to thieve or rob; but the Muskat Arabs^ in Anno 1695-. came with a Fleet, and plun- dred the Sea-coaft of Canara, and burnt Bar- celoar and Mangulorey and carried away a great Booty. And Conajee Angarie, in Anno 1720. came along the Coaft, and infulted it; but, on landing fome Men, found fuch Re finance, that made him embark again, with out doing much Mifchief to the Country. T h e r e is only one fmall Sea-port more in Canara, called Mangnzeer, about five Lea gues to the Southward of Mangulore, and three from Decullyy a large Fort built on an {iland clof(^ to the Land. And three Lea gues 4'! ' *of the Eaft Indies. 3.89 or Empire of Calecut, one of the moft po- tent of them all, has no Place in this Lill. But, The Country, tho' large and populous, is not fruitful in Corn, for there is Abundance of Rice imported from Canara; but, being low and fandy all along the Sea-coaft, except a few ri(ing Grounds, which are the moll lleril, yet it nourifhes vaft Numbers of Cocoa- nut and Arecka Trees, whole Fruit brings them great Gains from other Countries. The higher Grounds produce Pepper and Carda- mumS) the bell in the World ; and their Woods Teak Timber and Angelique for building. Sandal-wood, or Saunders, white and yellow } CaJ]ia L 'tqnum, or wildCinnamorii and Cajjia Fijfula, Nux vomica, and Cocoius India. Drugs grow plentifully in their Woods^ which are alfo well ftored with wild Game; both for Pleafure and Ufe. Their Moun tains produce Iron and Steel, but not fo good as we have in Europe. And their Sea is (to* red with many Species of excellent Fillies. When ihz'Portuguese came firll into /;/- dia, the Samor in Of Calecui was Lord Para mount of Malabar ; and, in his Dotage, when he was well advanced in Years^ 'he would needs be a Mahometan, and, to fhew his Zeal, would go in Pilgrimage to Mecca, to vifit the Tomb. Before he took his Voy age, which was by Sea, he made a Will, and having four Nephews, bequeathed each of them a Part of his Empire, To the eldefl he bequeathed Callifiree, whofe Sea-coait reaches from 'Decully to Ticorie* about 14 t T LeiH2 (jo A new Account Leagues. To the fecond, whom he loved beft, the Title of Samorin, and a Sea-coaft from Ticorie to Chit aw a, about the fame Di- llance. To the third Atthiga, which reach ed from Chitawa to Cape Comerin^ about 5*0 Leagues, becaufe that Part of the Country is contined between the Sea and the Mountains of Gatt 't, and is divided by Rivers from thofe Mountains, into more than 1000 lilands be- tween Chit aw a and Quoiloan. The young- eft had Ctf//, which reached from Cape Co- merin to the River of Nayapatam, about 50 Leagues more. The old Zealot dying in his Voyage, made great Difturbances in the State among the Brothers; and, after a long and bloody War, they concluded on the Partitions of the foregoing Lift. Many of the Tribes conti nue Tributaries to the Provinces mentioned in the old King's Will; but many more are independent. And fo I'll return to Deadly^ and proceed in my Obfervations along the Shore. Between Ttccully and Mount ^elly there is no Harbour, tho' a fine deep River keeps its Courfe to the Southward, along t he Shore, for about 8 Leagues, never, in all that Trad, going above a Bow-Hiot from the Sea. It difembogues itfelf by the Foot of Mount T&gt;elly^ over Rocks and Sands, in a Chanel of half a League broad. The In habitants are a wild fuperftitious uncivilized People. There is alfo a fmall River that runs clofe by the Foot of Mount ZteZ/y, on theoj the Eaft Indies. 291 the South Side. And 3 Leagues South from Mount 'Dclly is a fpacious deep Kiver, cal led BalliaPatarn, where the Engltjh Compa ny had once a Factory for Pepper; and tlic aforementioned Mr. B was the lalt Chief for their Aftairs there. Cannanore was formerly a i own belonging to the Crown of Portugal, with a .very' flrong Fort to guard it, built on a 1 oint of Land fo commodioufly, that the Sea fortih- ed above four Fifths of it, and had the Con- vcniency of &lt;1 frnall Bay for an Irainouij that could ihelter fmall Ships from the Fury of the South-well Monfoons. Fhe ■Jjutch came with a I'leet about the \eai 1660. anc landed a fmall Army, and were joyned by a great Number oi the Natives, who ucie weary of the Tyranny of the Tortngneze. The very firll Day that they opened then Trenches a Tortugueze Fidalgo was killed on a Baftion, by a Shot from the 'Dutch, which fo frightned the Governor of the Vort, that, in the Night, he made his Li cape, aaa .cri the Garifon to capitulate for themfdves* w^hich they did next Day, to fave the li.nu- (ion of Chriftian Blood by heretical Cannon. The 'Dutch continue flill Mailers or the Fort, and added a large Curtain, with two royal Baftions fronting the Land Avenues. They demolilhed the 'Town, and, vm - 11 Stones, built thofe Defences. Their Trade is very fmall, fo that their Garifon conui.s of about forty Soldiers and a Captain, who is Governor of the l^ort: But there is apict- t T ilyl A new Account ty large Town built in the Bottom of the i Bay, that is independent of the T&gt;atch^ and that Town, with fome circumjacent Coun^ try, is under the Government of Adda Ra jah, a Mahometan Malabar Prince, who, up- on Occalion, can bring near xoooo Men in j to the Field. His Government is not abfo- lute, nor is it hereditary ; and, inllead of gi ving him the Truft .of the Treafury which comes by Taxes and Merchandize, they have Chefts made on Purpole, with Holes made in their Lids, and their Coin being all Gold, j whatever is received by the Treafurer, is put into thofe Chefts by thefe Holes; and each Cheft has four Locks, and their Keys are put in the Hands of the Rajah, the Commi/Iio- ncr of Trade, the chief Judge and the Trea furer ; and, when there is Occafion for Mo ney, none can be taken out without all thefe four be prefent, or their Deputies. hi Anno 1668. the Prince came into the ^jutch Fort to pay a Compliment to the Cap tain. He had brought about 5-0 Attendants with him. \\ hile the Prince was complimen ting the Captain, the Malabars took the Op portunity of the Dutch Security, and killed the Sentinel at the Gate ; but the Sol diers being all in their Barracks, and their Arms ready, made a feafonable Sally, and drove the Malabars out, with the Lofs of twenty of their Number; and the T&gt;utch ihut their Gate. The Fort is large, and the Governor's Lodgings at a good Dillance from the Gate, fo that the Fray was over be foreof the Eaft Indies. 295 fore either the Prince or the Ttutch Captain knew any Thing of the Matter; and an Of ficer bringing the News, the Prince ordered a Search to be made for the Ringleader, and being found, he fentenccd him to be fmear- ed over with Hony, and made fad to a Co coa-nut Tree in the Sun till he died. Next Morning the Sentence was put in Execution. Thefe Cocoa-nut Trees producing a fweet Liquor called Toddy, bring vait Numbers of Wafps and large red Ants to drink the Li quor. Thofe Ants bite as painfully as the Stinging of Wafps. When the Sun begins to be hot, they leave the Top of the Tree, and burrow in Holes about the Root. In their Paifage downward they fixt on the Carcaie befmeared with the Hony, and foon bur rowed in the Flefh. The poor Mifcreant was three Days in that fenllble Torment before he expired. The Tlutch Captain begged e- very Day fpr a Pardon, or at leail for a mil der or quicker Death; but the Prince was inexorable. In Anno ijoi. I hired a Ship called the Al bemarle, in Service of the new eftablifhed Eaft-india Company, to ferve me three Months and an half on a Voyage from Su- rat to the Malabar Coaft, and back ; and having Occafion to call at Cannanore, I ac companied the Captain of the Fort and an Engltjh Faftor from Tellicherry to the Court of Omn 'itree, SuccelTor to the eldeil Son of the Samorln before mentioned^ who died in his Voyage towards Mecca. T 3 C ap- ' Tz 94 necw -d ccom t C a p t a i n Beawcs-) who commanded ths yllhemarle, accompanied us alfo, cair^ing a Drum and two Trumpets with us, to make our Compliment the more folemn. This was a Vifit paid him by all his Tributaries and Friends, to willi him many happy Years, it being his Birth-day. We travelled eight or ten IVliles before we came to his Palace, which was built with I wigs, and co\cied with Cadjans or Cocoa-nut 1 ree Leaves w o- ven together. We were admitted to his l ie» fence aflbon as we arrived, in an open Giccn juit by his Palace Window, which lookt in to it, where fat his Majetty, with his Queen, and three or four of his Children, pretty well grown up. We paid our Compliment each with a Zcqueen in Cold, and a few Grains of Rice laid on it, and fo, by an Inter preter we had fome frivolous DifcQurle. He treated us with Toddy^ fome ^Plantains, and young Cocoa-nuts; and then, after an Hours Stay, we had Audience of Leave, and fo de- parted. , Otnnitree himfelf was a Alan of a good Afped, about 40 Years of Age, of an Olive Colour. His Drefs was only a Silk Lungte or Scarf made fad by a Girdle ot Gold Plate, about his Middle, that reacht to his Knees, with great Jewels of mafly Gold, let with Rubies, Emeralds and Pearl, hanging at his Ears, but no Ornament on his Head, but a very beautiful Head of Hair hanging over his Shoulders. His Queen and Daughters Were in the fame Habit, only their Hair wasof the Eafl: Indies. 295 tied up behind. They were all naked above the Navel, and were bare-footed. The Queen had a cheerful Countenance, and very af fable to us and others, who had the Honoui to Hand near her, dillnbuting Settle and J- recka with her own royal Hands, to bu an gers, who came, as we did, to compliment the Prince her Husband. A bout the Year 1680. there were three Princes of the Blood royal, who confpired to cut him and his Family off, to polfefs themfelves of the Government ; but being detefted, they were beheaded on Altars built of Stone. About two Miles from Cannanore the Altars were ilan^ing ^ , was there. They were only fquarc Piles of hewn Stone, tibout three i&lt;.nus ^ four Yards each Side. ^ ^ , Adda Rajah's Dominions reach but ten Miles to the Southward of Cannanore, to Tel- licherry River, near which he has an Hai- bour called Ttormefatam. Us PaUage inwam is deep enough, but embarailed .with Rocks m its Entrance. It has an Ifland againits Mouth, called Caeca Viva, about half a League from the Shore, invironed witu c i^. s Adda Rajah has alfo the Dominion over the Lacca Diva lilands, which ly about 40 Leagues oft' the Malabar Coaft, between the Latitudes of eight Degrees and an half and twelve and an half. I have feen eighteen ot them. They are all very low, and have ma ny dangerous Sholcs among them, and ^to t it.2.9^ ^ ww Account Northward of them. The Chanel between them and the Maldiva Iflands, is called the eight Degree Chanel. There are no Dan gers in it, and fometimes we pafs through without feeing either the Maldivas, or them. There is another Chanel through them in u Degrees Latitude. Their Product is only Cocoa-nuts and Fifti. Of the Cocoa-nut Kernels they ex- prefs Oyl, which is fine and clear, fitting for Lamps; and, when it is new, ferves their Kitchins. Of the Rind of the Nut they make Cayar, which are the Fibres of the Cask that environs the Nut fpun fit to make Cordage and Cables for Shipping, and for feverai o- ther Ufes. Their i iili they dry, and export to the Continent. Sometimes in the South- wcit Monfoons they find Amber-greafe flot- ing on the Sea. I faw a Piece in Mda Ra- ja/js Poffellion, as big as a Bulhel, and he valued it at 10000 Rupees, or 115-0 L. Sterl.

The Occafion of the War, as I was in formed, began about a Trifle. The Nayer, that was Lord of the Mannor, had a Royal ty, for every Velfel that unladed at Tellt- cherry, paid two Bales of Rice Duty to him. There was another Royalty of every tenth Filh that came to the Market there, and both together did not amount tozo L. Ster. per Annum. The Chief either appropriated thefe Royalties to his own, or the Compa ny's Ufe, and the Nayer complained of the Injuftice, but had no Redrefs. Thefe little Duties were the beft Part of the poor Nay- ers Subfiftence, which made it the harder to ,11! nlill f:' ' A4 » J, lif ^4 new Account to bear, fo his Friends adviled him to repel Force by Force, and diiturb the Fadory what he could, which he accordingly did (by the lecret AiTillance of his Friends) for above to Years. The Company are the bell Judg es whether the War .is like to bring any Pro fit ro their Affairs there, or no. The eilablilhed Religion of this Country is 'Paganifm; but there are a few black Chn- f tafis that live under the Protection of the radory, and fome of them ferve for Soldi ers in the Garifon. They have a little Church itanding within the outward Wall of the Fa ctory, fcrved by a Tortugueze Pricft or two, who get their Subfitience by the Alms of the Parifli. And the Englijh have Punch- houfes, where the European Soldiers make Oblations to Bacchus, and if they want De votion, which their Accounts can certify at Pay-day, they are forced to commute with their Officer, or undergo fome wholfom Dif- cipline or Chaftifement. About four Miles to the Southward of Tellicherrjy is a fmall French Factory lately fettled at the Mouth of a fmall River, but for what End I know not; but I believe more to employ a little Stock for the Gentlemen of Calecut Factory's Account, than for the French Company's. And eight or ten Miles farther to the Southward, is Bur gar a, a Sea-port in the Do minions of Ballanore Bur gar ie, a formidable Prince. His Country produces Pepper, and the bell Cardamums in the World. I once calledof the Eaft Indies.

I returned Aijfwer, that his Vifit would do me great Honour, and I fent my Barge to wait on him. He came on board in her, and hi ought about 100 Attendants in other Boats, along with hitn. I carried him to the gieat C^abpin, and. would have treated him with Coftee, Tea and Wine, or Spirits, but he would tafte none, telling me, that my. Water was pollu ted by our Touch, but he thanked me. rie defired to fee the Ship every where ; and I ordered he ihould have free Liberty, and he went for an Hour to and again, making his Obfervations; and, when he had feen what he thought tit, he told me, that he would build a Ship of the fame Dimenfions, but there wanted W ater enough in his Rivers 10 flote her- • ^ , This Prince, and his PredecelTors, have been Lords of the Seas, Time out of Mind, and all trading Veilels between Cape Come- rln and c Damaan, were obliged to carry his PafTes. Thofe of one Mall paid for their Pafles about eight Shillings yearly, and thofe with three paid about fixteen; but when the 'Portugueze fettled in India, then they pre tended to the Sovereignty of the Seas, which occafioned a War between him and them, that has laded ever llnce. He keeps fome light I 'I ' IS FWtfi I nm 300 d new Account light Gallies, that row and fail very well, which cruize along the Coall, from Ottober to May y to make Prize of all who have not his Pafs. In our Difcourfe, I • asked him if he was not afraid to venture his Perfon on board of a Merchant Ship, fmce he himfelf was an Enemy to all Merchants that traded on thefe Coalls. He anfwered, that he had heard of my Character, and that made him learlefs, and that he was no Enemy to Trade, but only vindicated his Sovereignty of thofe Seas before mentioned, and that our own King was invelled with the like Sovereignty, not only on his own Coalls, but on thofe of France, Holland and &lt;r Deiwiark i and could have no greater Right than he had, only he was in a better Condition to oblige the Tranf. greiiors of his Laws to Obedience than he was: However he would maintain his Claim and Right the beil Way he could, and who- eyer loll their Ships or VclTels for Contempt of his Authority, might blame their own Ob- ftinacy or Folly, and not him. H e fiayed about three Hours on board, and, at his going away, I prefented him with five \ ards of fcarlet Cloth, a fmall Carpet, a Fowling-piece and a Pair of Piftols finely gilt, which Prefent he feemed highly pleafed with; and he took a Manila, or Wrill-jew el oft from his left Arm, on which was en- grayen fomething of their Language, in their own Characters, and putting it on my k/t A'm, declared me a tree Denizon in ail ^ erritories; and all his Attendants paid theirof the Eaft Indies. ^01 their Compliments to me with profound Re-* foefl. At his going over the Side, he gave the Boatfwain ten Zequeens for waiting on him while he viewed the Ship) and ten more for the Seamen to make a Feaft, and when my Barge landed him, he gave the Cockfwain five ZequeeitSy and loaded her back with Poultry and Fruit. He was a very well Iha- ped Man, about 40 Years of Age, of a very dark Colour, but not quite black, his Eyes very lively and fparkling, and fomething of a majeftick Air in his Deportment. Next Day I waited on him afliore, and he carried me to his Palace, which was very meanly built of Reeds, and covered with Co coa-nut Leaves, but very neat and clean. He had two Rows of BettU Trees, which are very tall and ftraight, fet in Order about fifty Yards from the Door of his Palace, for it was not large enough to be called a Gate, and there he treated me with Rice, Fowl and freili Fifti dreft after their Way; and, after Dinner, he ihewed me feveral Ware- houfes like Barns, full of black Pepper and Qardamums ; and he told me, he wondred why the Englijh did not fettle a Fadory in his Dominions rather than at Cdie cut or Tel- llcherry, for he lupplied both theie Coun tries with his Commodities; and, confider- ing the Cuftoms paid to him were but 5* fer Cent, and what was carried into their Coun tries mud pay other Cuftoms to the Princes, the Company would find Pepper and Carda- rnums much cheaper in his Dominions than5oi new Account they could polHbly have them at their Fa- d:ories where they were fettled. I told him, that fending his Veffels to cruize on Mer chant Ships had blailed the Reputation of his Country. He anfwered, that if the Compa ny would make a Trial of a few Years in trading with him, they would be convinced of his fair Dealings; or, if I would come and ftay in his Country, he would build a good Stone Houfe at his own Charge, and make a Fortification round it, in any Place that I ihould choofe in his Dominions, and that I jfoould be Superintendent of all the Com merce and Trade in his Country. I told him, that I could not accept of his Favours with out the Approbation of our Company, and that would require Time to be got. This happened in January 1703* I n 1707. he built a new Ship, which I had a Mind to buy. I was then at Couch 'tn, ^nd fent him W ord, that I deligned him a Villt. He returned an Anfwer, that I was a Free man in hi§ Country, and might be allured of an hearty Welcom. About ten Days after I came in a fmall Boat, to a Place belonging to him, called Mealie. When News of my Arrival were carried to him, he fent a Per- fon of Diilindion, with twenty armed Men, to receive me, and ordered me to be lodged in a Stone Houfe, the common Place for mbaiFadprs to lodge in, when any had Bu- finefs to come to him. The Bedding was only fome Mats fpread on a Couch ; but it is the common Bedding of the Country, andof the F.aft Indies. 7 J bis Hishnefs has no better. Before I was conduced to my Lodgings, there was a 1 re- fent of Rice, Butter, Hens, Fruits and Roots put into a Pantry for me, and my Retinue and Guard, for Supper. Next Morning he lent a Compliment, that he dented to ! n . at his Palace. I went accordingly, and he re ceived me very gracioufly, with many 1 ro- teilations of his t ricndiliip? cind told itic 9 he would make good all that he had promiUw before, if I would continue in his Country, I returned his Compliment in the propereft Terms I could, and told him, I came tokifc his Hand, and to buy his new Ship, if he and I could jigrcc. He told me, that 1 i.i &gt;j1&lt;1 have her at a very reafonable Pi ice, biu inat his Religion forbad him to fell any Ship that he either built or bought, till he had tirft employed her in one Voyage himfclf. Htay- ed feven Days in his Country, and he treat ed me after the fame Manner as if I had been an Ambafiabor, in defraying all my Charges, and allowing his own Servants to attend me. When ! went to his Palace the fir ft Time, I was inndcently guilty of ill Manners, for, walking with him near his Lodgings, \ chan ced to touch the i hatch with my &gt; ^at, which polluted it fo much, that, afToon as I went awav, he ftript it of its Covering, be- caufe Religion forbad him to fleep under it w ^hen it was thus polluted; but it was foon re-fandified by a new Thatching. If any of his own Subjects had been guilty of the lame Fault,304 A new A Hulr, they might have run in Danger of lo- ling their Lives for the Offence. I daily received for my Table fix Hens, tuo] oiinds of Butfcr, five and twenty Pound i ei S of, R Ice ' a Quarter of a Pound of &gt; Pepper, and fome Salt, fome Leaves, ' and green Jrecka, with twenty youna, and ten old Cocoa-nuts, but no Filh, which was a favourite Difli of mine,. I fent my own Ser- vants to the Hfhing-boats, when they came II om fiflung, to buy fome; but the poor Fel lows durft not take a Peny of Money, yet i fupphed me with what Fifli I wanted, and my oeivants took their Opportunity to pay for them, when none of the Prince's Servants were prefent. } V ' Et i ] took Leave to depart, he feem- ed to be forry that I Hayed fo fliort a Time with him, and ordered two Days Provifions j e put into my Jdoat, and I prefented the rT vJf c r ^ waited on me to the Sea Side with five Zeqtieens for a Fcafl of to mm and his Companions.

XXV. Obfervations on the Samorin and his Conn- try, their Religion, Laws and CuJ?oms i Trodutt of the Country and its Commerce 1 an Account of their War with the Dutch,; begun in Anno 1708. and the Confequences of it. I HE Samor in's Country reaches along the Sea-coail from Ticori to Chitwa* : xx Leagues. His chief City (if it may be called one) is Calecut, where he general ly refides. His Palace is built of Stone, and there is fome faint Refemblance of Gran deur to be' feen about his Court. He is reck oned the powerfulleft King on the Sea-coaft of Malabar, and has the beft Trade in his Country, which makes both himfelf and | U People^06 A new Account People richer than their Neighbours. The Englijh had a Faftory there many Years, but now the Chief and the Fadors are remo ved to Tellkherryy and what Quantities of Pep per they procure there by their black Servants, , is fent by Sea to TeU'tcherry. The French have alfo a fmall Factory, fettled in Anno 1698. but they are not in a Condition to car ry on a Trade for want of Money and Cre dit: And the Tortugueze have a Church, but poorlv decorated, and pitifully endowed, for Chr'tfttan Charity is much decayed there as well as in other Places; and the Priefts Perquifites are but fmall by Converts. The Produft of the Samorins Country is Pepper in Abundance, Bettle-nux. and Cocoa- nut, and that Tree produceth Jaggery, a Kind of Sugar, and Copera^ or the Kernels of the Nut dried, and out of thofe Kernels there is a very clear Oyl expreft; alfo Sandel-wood, Iron, Caffia-lignnm and Timber for building, all which Commodities they export to the great Benefit: of the Inhabitants. Many ftrange Cuftoms were obferved in this Country in former Times, and fome ve ry odd ones are ftill continued. It was an ancient Cullom for the Samor in to reign but twelve Years, and no longer. If he died be fore his Term was expired, it faved him a troublefom Ceremony of cutting his own Throat, on a publick Scaffold erefted for that Parpofe. He firit made a 1 eaft for all his Nobility and Gentry, who are very nu merous. After the Feall, he faluted his Guefts,of the Eaft Indies. ^67 Guefts, and went on the Scaffold, and very decently cut his own Throat in the View ot the Affembly, and his Body was, a little While after, burned with great Pomp and Ceremony, and the Grandees elected a new Samor in. Whether that Cuftom was a reli gious or a civil Ceremony 1 know not, but it is now laid afide. A nd a new Cuftom is followed by the modern Santortns^ that a Jubilee is proclaim ed throughout his Dominions, at the End ot twelve Years, and a Tent is pitched for him in a fpacious Plain, and a great Feaft is cele brated for ten or twelve Days with Mirth and Jollity, Guns firing Night and Day, fo at the End of the Feaft any four of the Guefts that have a Mind to gain a Crown by a de- fperate Aftibn, in fighting their \\ ay through '30 or 40000 of his Guards, and kill the Sa* tnorin in his Tent, he that kills him, fucceeds him in his Empire. In Anno 1695-. one of thofe Jubilees hap pened, and the Tent pitched near Tennany* a Sea-port of his, about fifteen Leagues to the Southward of Calecut. There were but three Men that would venture on that de- fperate Adion, who fell in, with Sword and Target, among the Guards, and, after they had killed and wounded many, were them- felves killed. One of the 'DefPerados had a Nephew of fifteen or fixteen Years of Age, that kept clofe by his Uncle in the Attack on the Guards, and, when he faw him fall, the Youth got through the Guards into the u X Tent 330^ A new Account Tent, and made a Stroke at his Majefty^ Head, and had certainly difpatched him, if a large Brafs Lamp which was burning over his Head, had not marred the Blow; but, before he could make another, he was killed by the Guards; and, I believe, the fame Sa- morln reigns yet. I chanced to come that Time along the Coaft, and heard the Guns for two or three Days and Nights fucceflively. When the Samor in marries, he muft not cohabit with his Bride till the Nambourie or chief Prieft has enjoyed her, and, if hepleaf- es, may have three Nights of her Company, becaufe the firft Fruits of her Nuptials muft be an holy Oblation to the God ilie wor ships : And fome of the Nobles are fo com- plaifant as to allow the Clergy the fame Tri bute ; but the common People cannot have that Compliment paid to them, but are for ced to fupply the Priefls Places themfelves. Any Women, except the firft Quality, may marry twelve Husbands if they pleafe, but cannot have more at one Time, and they mult all be of her own Caji or Tribe, under Pain ot Excommunication and Degradation of Honour, if flie marries into a lower Tribe; and the Men are under the fame Penalty if they tranfgrefs that Law, but they are'not confined to a fet Number of Wives, as the Women are to Husbands. W h e n a W oman is married to the firft of her Husbands, Hie has an Houfe built for her own Conveniency, and that Husband co habits with her till ihe takes a fecond, or fo manyof the Eaft Indies. 3 09 many as (lie is prefcribed by Law, and the Husbands agree very well, for they cohabit with her in their Turns, according to their Priority of Marriage, ten Days, more or lefs, according as they can fix a Term among themfelves, and he that cohabits with her, maintains her in all Things neceffary, tor his Time, fo that (lie is plentifully provided for by a conftant Circulation. When the Man that cohabits with her goes into her Houfe, he leaves his Arms at the Door, and none dare remove them, or enter the Houfe, on Pain of Death; but, if there are no Arms to guard the Door, any Acquaintance may freely vifit her. And all- the Time of Cohabitation Ihe ferves her Husband as Purveyor and Cook, and keeps his Clothes and Arms clean. W hen fhe proves with Child, fhe nomi nates its Father, who takes Care of its Edu cation, after fhe has fuckled it, and brought it to walk or fpeak; but the Children are never Heirs to their Fathers Eftates, but the Father's Sifter's Children are, and if there are none, then to the neareft in Confangui- nity from his Grandmother. And this Cu^ Horn is alfo praftifed among the Mahometan Malabars. T here are many Degrees or Dignities in the Church as well as in the State. The Nam- bouries are the firft in both Capacities of Church and State, and fome of them are Popes, being fovereign Princes in both. The Brahmans or Brawanies are thefecond in the y 3 Church5 to A ne-iso Account Church only. The Buts or Magicians ara next to them, and are in great Veneration, The Nayers or Gentlemen are next, and are very numerous. The Teyvees are the Farmers of Cocoa-nut Trees, and are next to the Gentry. Merchants are of all Orders, ex cept Nambonries, and are in fome Efteem. The Toulias produce the Labourers and Me- chanicks. They may marry into lower Tribes without Danger of Excommunication, and fo may the Muckwas or Filhers, who, 1 think, are an higher Tribe than the Toidias^ but the Toultcbees are the lowetl Order of human Creatures, and are excluded from th^ Benefit of human and divine Laws. If a *Poulia or Teyvee meet a Nayer on the Road, he muft go afide to let his Wor- fliip pafs by, left the Air Ihould be tainted, on Pain of a fevere Chaftifement, if not of Death; but the jPou lie bets are in a much worfe Statei for, by the Law, they are not permitted to coriverfe with any other Tribe, nor can they wear any Sort of Cloth, but only a little Straw made fafl before their Privities, with 6 Line round their Middle. They are not permitted to build Houfes or Huts on the pround, nor to inhabit the Plains where there is Corn Ground, but mufl dwell in Woods, and build on the Boughs of Trees, like Birds, with Grafs and Straw. If acci dentally they fee any Body coming towards them, they will howl like Dogs, and run a- way, left thofe of Quality fliould take Offence at their breathing in the fame Air that theyof the Eafl; Indies. 51E do. They are not permitted to till and fow the Ground, only in obfcure Places of the Woods they plant Fruits and Roots, wople Seeds they ueal from their neighbouring Gardens in the Plains, in the Night, and it they are caught Healing, Death is then ru- nifliment, on the Spot where they are taken, without any Form orProcefs of Law. W hen they want Pood, they come to the Skirts ot their Woods, and howl like Foxes, and the charitable Toulias and Teyvees relieve them with Rice boiled or raw, and fome Cocoa- nuts and other Fruits, which they lay down in a convenient Place; and when their bc- ncfaftors come within twenty Paces ot them with their Alms, they walk off, and let the Touiuhees come to their hood, which they forthwith carry into the Woods. They aic very fwift in running, and cunning in catch ing wild Beads and Fowl; but they have few or no Fiih among the Mountains. The inferior Tribes have Liberty ofCon- fcience in fancying their Deities, and wor- {hipping them. I have feen, at many was' Houfes, a fquare Stake of Wood, with a few Notches cut about it, and that ^takc drove into the Ground, about two Foot ot it bein CT left above, and that is covered with fome Cadjans or Cocoa-nut iiec Leaves, and is a Temple and a God to that family. Some worlhip the firft Animal they fee in the Morning, let it be Cat, Dog or Seipent, and they pay their Adorations to it tnc 'u nolc? Day. Others choofe a Tree of their Father's^11 A new Account: or fome dear Friend's planting, and that he gets confecrated, and it then becomes his God ; but they all believe the Immortality of the Soul and Tranfmigration, and the Ado ration of the great God, of whom they have many wild Opinions. The great God's Image they can neither fancy nor make, but believe, that he fent an huge large Fowl from Heaven, that laid a fwinging Egg in the Sea, and, in Procefs of Time, it was hatch'd by the Sun, and forth came the World, with all Animals, Vegetables, &amp;c. that inhabit it now, and that poor Adam was fet alone on the Top of an high Moun tain in Zealoany which is called, to this Day, Baba Adam, from that Tradition, but, being tired of fo lonefom a Life, he defcended in to the Pjain, and there he met with Hevah, whom he prefently knew to be his Kinfwo- man, and they flruck Hands, and were there married. The great Men of the Clergy build Tem ples, but they are neither large nor beautiful. Their Images are all black, and deformed, according as they fancy the infernal Gods to be fhaped, who, they believe, have fome Hand in governing the World, particularly about benign or malignant Seafons that hap pen in the Produdions or Sterility of the Earth, for which Reafon they pay a lateral Adoration to them. Their Images are all placed in dark Temples, and are never feen but by Lamp-light, that burns continually before them,of the Eaft Indies. 315 When criminal Cafes are brought before the Magiftrate, that want the Evidence of WitnelFes to fupport them, the Trial of Truth is by Ordeal. The accufed Perfon is obliged to put his bare Hand into a Pot of boyling Oyl, and if any Bliiler appears, the Party is found guilty; and I have been cre dibly informed, both by Engltjh and 'Dutch Gentlemen, as well as Natives, that had feen the Trial, that the innocent Perfon has not been in the leall affeaed with the fcalding Oyl, and then the Punilliment due to the Crime, is infliaed on the Accufer. The Samor in entred into a War with the Ttutch Eaft-india Company in Anno 1714. and the Chief of the Engl'tjh Fadory, who was a privy Counfeller to the Samorhty had a great Hand in promoting it. The Quarrel began about a fmall Fort that the 'Dutch were building at Chitzva. The Ground whereon it ftood was a defert Morafs by the River's Side, and was claimed both by the King of Couchin and the Samor in. The King of Couchin made over his Claim to the Dutch, who made fmall Account who had the beft Title, but carried on their Work with Diligence. 1 he Samorin^ with, and by the Advice of his Council, got fome of his Soldiers to be entred into the Dutch Service, under the Difguife of daily Labourers to earry Stones, Morter, tSc. for building the Fort, and to take their Opportunity to ly in Ambufcade in a Morafs overgrown with Reeds near the Fort, Two514 . A ne-iH Aceomt- Two ^utch Lieutenants, who had the Overfceing of the Work, were one Evening diverting tbetnfelves with a Game at Tables in a Guard Room about half a Mile from the? Fort. They had let fome of their 'Dutch Sol diers go ftragglin?; abroad, and the Sentinels were carelefs under the Security of Friend- fliip, which gave the difguifed Workmen an Opportunity to kill the Sentinels, and make their Signal for the Ambufcade, who, in a few Minutes, took the half-built Fort. The Lieutenants came prefently after, with what Forces they had, to retake it, but one being killed dead in advancing, the other thought it impratlicable to attack greater Forces with^ in than he had without, and fo embarked, with his Men, on board fmall Boats for Cou- fhin, about 10 Leagues from Chitwa. I fortuned to be at Cm chin when he and his Men arrived, and, by a Court Martial, he was fentenced to be Ihot to Death, which Sentence I faw executed. The Samorm\ People next Day ereded a Flag-ilaff, and hoifled the Englijh Flag, which the Englljh Chief had fent by the Ambufcade, and im mediately after fet about demolilhing tho Walls, that were built, of the Fort, and car? ^ied off fome great Guns belonging to the ^Dutch. And this was the Prelude of the War. I knew pretty well th^ Strength of the An- tagonifts, what Power the Samorin had, and what Powers the Kings of Couching Taaru and Torcat could afliil the Uutch with, and I wroteof the Eaft Indies. 315 wrote to the Chief the Refolutions of the 'Dutch, and advifed him not to embark himfelf or his Matters in that Affair, becaufe \Viir w&lt;is 3. different Province tiorn nils, lie took my Advice fo ill, that he wrote tq Bombay, that 1 was in the ^utch Intei eii| oppofite to the Right Honourable Company, and alfo to his Matters in England, as it the 'Dutch Company could need my Interett, Ad vice or Alfillance; but, as I had forewarned him, he found the Sawiovin was foiccd, after three Years War, to conclude a diflionour- able and difadvantageous Peace, whciein he was obliged to build up the I' oit he had de- molilhed, to pay the 'Dutch Company /' l' c 'f Cent, on all the Pepper exported out ot his Dominions for ever, and to pay a large bum towards the Charges of the \\ ar. Some 1 art of the Money, I believe, he borrowed. Whether our Eajl-'tud'ta Company go^ or loft by that War, 1 know not, nor will I pretend to pafs Judgment on their Affairs; but this I know, that the Chief loft a good Milk Cow, for the Chiefs of Calecut, for ma ny Years, had vended between yooand 1000 Chefts of Bengal Ophttm yearly up in the in land Countries, where it is very much ufed. The Water Carriage up the River being cheap and fecure, the Price of Of hum high, and the Price of Pepper low, fo that their Profits were great both Ways; for, it 1 mi- flake not, the Company paid the higheft Pri ces for their Pepper, and the in the Company's Pay, were employed aboiKjhe -%i6 A new Account Chiefs Affairs; and by the unexpefted Turn of Affairs caufed by the War, that Trade is fallen intirely into the Dutch Company's Hands, and it will be a very difficult Task to get it out again. The Englijh Company were formerly fo much refperted at Calecut^ that if any Debi tor went into their Fadory for Proteftion, none durft prefume to go there to difturb them; but that Indulgence has been fome- times made an ill Ufe of, to the Detriment of Englijb private Traders. They have a good Way of arreting Peo ple for Debt, viz. There is a proper Perfon fent with a fmall Stick from the Judge, who is generally a Brahman^ and when that Per fon finds the Debitor, he draws a Circle round him with that Stick, and charges him, in the King and Judge's Name, not to ftir iout of it till the Creditor is fatisfied either by Payment or Surety ; and it is no lefs than Death for the Debitor to break Prifon by going out of the Circle. They make ufe of no Pens, Ink and Pa per, but write on Leaves of Flags or Reeds that grow in Moraffes by the Sides of Ri vers. They are generally about 18 Inches long, and one and an half broad, tapering at both Ends, and a fmall Hole at one End for a String to pafs through.

And on two or three of thefe Leaves they 11 write as much as we can on a Sheet of fmall Paper. All their Records are written fo on Leaves, and they are fining and rolled up in a Scroll, and hung fome Time in Smoke, and then lockt up in their Cabinets. And I have feen fome fuch Leaves Smoke-dried, that, they told me, were above 1000 Years old. In Anno 1703. about the Middle of Fehru* dry, I called at Calecut in my Way to Su~ rat, and Handing into the Road, I chanced to llrike on fome of the Ruins ot the fun- ken Town built by the 'Portuguese in for mer Times. Whether that Town was fwal- lowed up by an Earthquake, as fome affirm, or whether it was undermined by the Sea, I will not determine; but fo it was, that in G Fathoms at the main Maft, my Ship, which drew ii Foot Water, fat fall a-fore the Chefs-tree. The Sea was fmooth, and, in a Ihort Time, we got off without Damage. The unfortunate Captain Green, who was afterwards hanged in Scotland, came onboard of my Ship at Sun-fet, very much overtaken with Drink, and feverals of his Men came in the fame Condition. He told me, that he had fome fmall Arms, Powder, Shot and Glafs-ware to difpofe of, and asked me if I would take them off his Hands at a very rea- fonable Rate. I told him, that next Morn ing?i8 A new Account ing I would fee them, and perhaps be aMeN chant for them. He told me, that the Arms and Ammunition were what was left of a large Quantity that he had brought from is land, but had been at 'Don Mafcherenas and Madagafcar y and had difpofed of the reft to good Advantage, among the Pirates, and had carried fome Pirates from Don Mafcherenas to St. Marys. I told him, that, in Prudence, he ought to keep thefe as Secrets, left he might be brought in T rouble about them. He madd but little Account of my Advice, and fo de parted. ^ About ten in the Night his chief Mate Mr. Mather came on board of my Ship, and feemed to be very melancholy. He asked ine, if I thought one of my Mates would be induced to go with Captain Green, that he inight be cleared of his Ship, and he would give that Mate that would accept of his Poll:, a very confiderable Gratuity. I told him, that luch a good Poft as he had on board the fVtorcejter was not eafily procured in India, lor we feldom preferred Strangers before we had a Trial of them. He burft out in Tearsj and told me, he ^as afraid that he was undone. I askt his Keafon for his melancholy Conjefture. He anfwered, that they had afted fuch Things in their Voyage, that would certainly bring them to Shame and Punilhment, if they hould come to Light; and he was alTured, that luch a Company of Drunkards as their Crewof the Eaft Indict ^ 19 Crew was compofed of, could keep no Se cret, tho' the Difcovery fhould prove their own Ruin. I told him, I was forry for his Condition, and that I had heard at Coikan, that they had not aded prudently nor ho- neftly in relation to fome Moors Ships they had vifited and plundred, and in finking a Sloop, with ten or twelve Europeans in her f - off Cot loan. He askt me if that was known at Coiloan, I told him, that the People there made no Secret of it, but as long as you did them no Harm, you are welcom to their Trade. Next Day I went afhore, and met Captain Green and his Supercargo Mr. Cat- lant, who had failed a Voyage from Surat to Sindy with me. Before Dinner-time they were both drunk, and Callant told me, that he did not doubt of making the greateij Voyage that ever was made from England on fo fmall a Stock as ^oo Pounds.- I wilht him Joy and Snccefs, but told him, that we Indians undprilood none of thofe profitable Voyages, but were well content with 30 or 40 per Cent. In the Evening their Surgeon accofledmc in my Walk along the Sea Side, and askt if i wanted a Surgeon. I told him I had two, and both very good ingenious Men. He faid, he wanted to flay in India, for his Life was uneafy on board of his Ship, that the' the Captain was civil enough, yet Mr. Ma ther was unkind, and had treated him with Blows for asking a pertinent Queflion at fome wounded Men, who were hurt in the En gagementjzci A new Account agement they had with the aforementioned loop. I heard too much to be contented with their Condud, and fo I fhunn'd their Converfation for the little Time I ftaid at Ca* lecut. Whether Captain Green and Mr. Ma ther had JufHce impartially allowed them in their Procefs and Sentence, I know not. I have heard of as great Innocents condemned to Death as they were. About x Leagues to the Southward of Calecut, is a fine River called Baypore, cap able to receive Ships of 3 or 400 Tuns. It has a fmall Ifland oH its Mouth, about half a Mile from the Shore, that keeps it fafe from the great Seas brought on that Coaft by the South-weft Monfoons. Four Leagues more foutherly is Tannore, a Town of fmall Trade, inhabited by Mahometans. They are a little free State, but pay an Acknowledgment to the Samorin. Five Leagues to the South ward of Tannore, is Tennany, mentioned be fore. It has the Benefit of a River, and was formerly a Place of Trade. The French and Englijh had their Fa dories there, but were removed about the Year 1670. And a- bout four Leagues more to the Southward, is Chitwa River, which bounds the Samo* riri% Dominions to the South. C h a p»-y the Eatt Indies. CHAP. XXVI.

Myn Heer Van Reede before mentioned, about the Year 1695'. had an Abftrad of their Hiftory tranflated from the Hebrew into low Dtitch. They declare themfelves to be of the Tribe of Manaffeh, a Part whereof was, by Order of that haughty Conqueror Nebu chadnezzar, carried to the eallermoft Pro vince of his large Empire, which, it Icems, reacht as far as Cape Comer in, which Jour ney 10000 of them travelled in three Years from their fetting out of Babylon. u When they arrived in the Malabar Coun try, they found the Inhabitants very civil and hofpitable to Strangers, giving them Li berty of Confcience in religious Matters, and the free Ufe of Reafon and Induitry in Oeconomy. There they increafed, both in Numbers and Riches, till in Procefs of Time, either by Policy or \V ealth, or both, they Came to purchafe the little Kingdom of Cran* ganore. And there being one Family among them much efteemed for Wifdom, Power and Riches, two of the Sons of that family were chofen by their E-lders and Senators, to govern the Common-wealth, and reign joyntly over them. Concord, the ftrongell Bonds of Society, was in a fhort Time bro ken, and Ambition took Place, for one or the Brothers inviting his Colleague to a 1' eau, and picking a Quarrel with his Guett, balely killed him, thinking, by that Means, to reign alone; but the Defund leaving a Son of a boldvf the Eaft Indies 511 bold Spirit behind him, revenged his Father's Death, by killing the Fratricide, and lb the State fell again into a Democracy, which ftill tontinues among the Jews here; but; the Lands have^ for many Ages^ recurred back into the Hands of the Malabar and Pover ty and OpprelHon have made many apoftatize. Between Cranganore and Couching there is an Ifland called Bayf 'in^ that occupies the Sea-coall, It is 4 Leagues long; but no Part of it is ^ Miles broad. The T&gt;utch forbid all VelTels or Boats to enter at Qranganori 2 And at Couchin the Chanel is about a Quar ter of a Mile broad, but very deep, tho' the Bar has not above 14 Foot Water at fpring Tides. The firft Europeans that fettled in Cou~ thin were the ^Portu^ueze^ and there they built a fine City on the River's Side, about 3 Leagues from the Sea; but the Sea gaining on the Land yearly, it is not now above 100 Paces from it. It (lands io pleafantlyj that the Tortupueze had a common Sayings that, China was a Country to get Money in^ and Couchin was a Tlace to fpend it in ; for thd great Numbers of Canals made by the Ri vers and Klandsj make Fiftiing and Fowling very diverting; And the Mountains are well ftored with wild Game. ^ , On the Infide of Baypiri llland, there is an old Fort built by the Torttfgueze^ called TalLiaporet to infped: all Boats that go be tween Cranganore and Couchin. And 5 Lea gues up the Rivulets is a Romijh Ghurch cal-j 6 t X ^ -It514 ^ Yrtw Account led Verapoh, ferved by French and Itallaii Priefts; and when a Bifhop comes into thofe Parrs, it is the Place of his Refidence. The 'Padre Superior of Verapoli, can raife, upon Occafion, 4000 Men, all Chriftians ol^ the Church of Rome ; but there are many more St. Thomas's Chrijiians that do not commu-* nicate with thofe of Rome^ and fome 'Portu- gueze, called Topafes, that communicate with neither, for they will be ferved by none but Tortuyieze Pricfis, becaufe they indulge them more in their Villany, and Abfolutions from Crimes are eafier purchafed from the Portugueze than from the French or Itali ans, who are generally much more polite and learned than the Portuguese, who are permitted to take the Habit of fome Order, without being examined whether the Novice has the common Qualifications of School^ learning. About x Leagues farther up towards the Mountains, on the Side of a fmall, but deep River, is a Place called Firdalgo, where the Inhabitants of Cmch'tn generally ailemble to tefrefh themfelves in the troublefom hot Months of April and May. The Banks and Bottom of the River is clean Sand, and the Water fo clear, that a fmall PeebleStone may be feen at the Bottom in three Fathoms Water. Every Company makes Choice of a Place by the River's Side, and pitch their Tents, and drive fome fmall Stakes before their Tents, in the River, on which they liana up Clothes for Blinds, to hide the Ladies 0 1 when-.4 of the Eaft Indies. 31? when they hath; but moft of them Iwitn dextroufly, and fwim under Water through the Stakes, into the open River, where the Men are diverting themlelyes, and there they dive, and play many comical mad 11 icks, till Breakfalt or Supper call them alhore, for it is in Mornings and Evenings that they bath and fwim ; for in the Heat of the Day the Sun fcorches. Very orten the Ladies lay Wafers of Treats with the Gentlemen, about their Swiftnefs and Dexterity in Iwim- minff, but generally the Ladies win the Wa gers! tho', \ believe, if the Men would ufe their Art and Strength, they might win the Prize. The Heat of the Day they pafs with n Game at Cards or Tables for Treats, by which Means they fare fumptuoully eyeiy Day, fometimes in one Tent, and fometimes in another ; and, at Night, every Family fleeps in their own Tent, on the lort clean Sand, Males and Females promilcuouily. T here is a Place on the Side or that Ki- ver, called Hell's Mouth. It is a fubterrane- ous Cave about four Yards broad, and thiee high, hewn out of a fpungy Iron-coloured Rock. I went into it with aLantein, and paft ftraieht forward about 400 Yards, but law no End to it. It is an Habitation for Snakes and Bats, who were fhghtned by ti-.c Light of our Candle and Noile. As we were tired with their Company, fo we returned back. They have no Tradition why it wai piade, or by whom. X 3 T he i i^z6 A nm Account The Water of this Country, near the Sea-coaft, from Cranganore to St. Andreas, which is about ix Leagues, has a bad Quar lity of making the conttant Drinkers of it have fwell'd Legs, Some it affefts in one Leg, and fome in both. I have feen Legs above a Yard about at the Ancle. It caufe^ no Pain, but itching; nor does the thick Leg feeiB heavier than the fmall one to thofe who have them: But the 'Dutch at Couchin, to prevent that Malady, fend Boats daily to 1 VerapLi, to lade with fmall portable Cask^ of 10 or \i Engltjh Gallons, to ferve the Ci- fy. The Company's Servants have their Wa ter free of Charges, but private Perfons pay Sixpence fer Cask, if it is brought to their Houfes; and yet, for all that Precaution, I Ihave leen both Tjutch Men and Women trou bled with that Malady. And no Cure has been yet found to heal or prevent if. The old Romtfb Legendaries impute the Gaufe of thofe great fwell'd Legs to a Curfe St. Thomas laid upon his Murderers and their Poflerity, and that was the odious Mark they iliould be diftinguiflied by; but St. Thomas Was killed by the Tilln'tgue Priefts at Malli- apore. on Chormandel, above 400 Miles di stant from this Coaft, and the Natiyes there 'know none of that Malady, Couchm is waflit by the greateft Outlet on this Coall:, and being fo near the Sea, makes it ftrong by Nature j but Art has not been Wanting to ftrengthen it. The City built by {he Tortuzueze vyas about a Mile and an half longiof the Eaft Indies. 3*7 long, and a Mile broad. took it from the Tortugueze about the Year 1660 when Hekloff Van Ghon was General of the Vutch Forces by Land, and Commodore of a Fleet by Sea. Thelnfolence of the Ptfr- tugueze had made feveral neiahbounng Prin ces become their Enemies, who joyned with the 'Dutch to drive them out of their Neigl bourhood, and the King of larlv affifted with xooco Men.

The Garifpn generally confiils of^ 300 effedive Men: And from Cape Comerin upwards they are allowed, in all their l^orts and Factories, 00 Soldiers, and 100 Seamen, all Europeans^ efides fome Tofafes, and the Militia. They have their Stores of Rice from BarfaLore 9 becaufe the Malabar Rice will not keep a- bove three Months out of the Husk, but in the Husk it will keep a Year. The Country produces great Quantities of Pepper, but lighter than that which grows more northerly. Their Woods afford good Teak for building, and Anpeliqtie and ^Paw* beet^ tor making large Chefls and Cabinets, which are carried all over the WellCoafts of India. They have alfo Iron and Steel in Plenty, and Bees Wax for exporting. Their Seas afford them Abundance of good Fifh of feveral Kind^, which, with thofe that are caught in their Rivers, make them very cheap. T h e King of Couchifiy who, at bed, is but a Vaffal to the Tkutchy has a Palace built of Stone about half a League from the 'Dutch City; and there is a ftraggling Village not far from the Palace, that bears the Name of old Couchtn. It has a Bazaar or Market in it, where all Commodities of the Country's Pro-i ^30 ^ new Account Produft are fold; but there are no Curiofi- ties to be found in it. The King's ordinary Refidence is at another Palace 6 Leagues to the Southward of Couching and x from St. Andrea ; but he keeps but a very fmall Court. Mudbay is a Place, that, I believe, few can parallel in the World. It lies on the Shore of St. Andrea, about half a League out in the Sea, and is open to the wide Ocean, and has neither Ifland nor Bank to break off the Force of the Billows, which come rolling with great Violence, on all other Parts of the Coail, in the South-well Monfoons, but, on this Bank of Mud, lofe themfelves in a Mo ment, and Ships ly on it, as fecure as in the beft Harbour, without Motion or Difturbance. It reaches about a Mile along Shore, and has fhifted from the Northward, in 30 Years, a- bout three Miles. St. Andrea is only a Vil lage, with a Church in it dedicated to St. Andrew, and is lerved by St. Thomas's Priells, who generally are both poor and illiterate, About x Leagues to the Southward of St, Andrea begin the Dominions of ore at, or Torkah, It is of fmall Extent, reaching not above 4 Leagues along the Sea-coail. The Prince is poor, having but little Trade in his Country, tho' it was a free Port for Pirates when Euory and Kid robbed on the Coall of India-, but, fince that Time, the Pirates infeft the northern Coafts, finding the richefl Prizes amongft the Mocha and 'Per- fia Traders. The Tiutch keep a Faftory at Torkah, but of fmall Confequence. - ,of the Eaft Indies. £ Coilcoiloan is another little Principality con tiguous to Torkahy where the Tiutch keep ^Ifo a Faftory. And next to it is Qotloan another fmall Principality, It has the Benefit of a River, which is the foyther- moft Outlet of the Couchin Iflands; and the 'Dutch have a fmall Fort within a Mile of it, on the Sea-fliore, which they took from the *Portugmze when they took Couchtn. It keeps a Garifon of 30 Men, and its Trade is inconfiderable. Erwa lies x Leagues to the Southward of Cot loan, where the 'Danes have a fmall Fa- 6fory (landing on the Sea Side. It is a thatcht Houfe of a very mean Afpeft, and their Trade anfwers, every Way, to the Figure their Faftory makes. Aujengo lies 1 Leagues to the Southward of Erway a Fort belonging to the Engltjhy built, at the Company's Charge, in Anno 1695*. It ftands on a fandy Foundation, and is naturally fortified by the Sea on one Side, and a little River on the other. It is in the Dominions of the Queen of Attingdy to whom it pays Ground Rent. Before it was built, the Engl'tjh had two fmall Faftories in her Country to the South of Aujengo. One was called Brmjan, the other Ruttera ; but, being naked Places, were fubject to the In-» fults of Courtiers, whofe Avarice is feldom or never fatisfied: But I wonder why the Englijh built their Fort in that Place, for there is not a Drop of good W ater for drin king within a League of it j and the Road13 x A new Account has a foul Bottom for anchoring, and conti- nnally a great Surf on the Shore, when they might as well have built it near the Red Cliffs to the Northward, from whence they have their Water for drinking, and where there is good Anchor-ground, and a tolerable good landing Place for Boats in the North- eaft Monlbons. The Country produces good Quantities of Pepper and long Cloth, as fine as any made in India. When our Factories were at Ruttcrazwd Brinjan, they fent a yearly Prefent to the Queen of Attinga, whofe Court is about 4 Leagues within Land from Aujengo. In An* no 1685-. when the Prefent was fent, a young beautiful Englijh Gentleman had the Ho nour to prefent it to her black Majefty; and allbon as the Queen faw him, fhe fell in Love with him, and next Day made Propofals of Marriage to him, but he modeftly refufed fo great an Honour: However, to pleafe her Majerty, he ftaid at Court a Month or two, and, it is reported, treated her with the fame Civility as Solomon did the Queen of Ethio pia, or Alexander the Great did the Amazo nian Queen, and fatisfied her fo well, that when he left her Court, Ihe made him fome Prefents. About the Year 17x0. there were fome civil Broils in this Country, and the annual Prefent being demanded, the Englijh Chief refufed to pay it to any but to the Queen herfelf, tho' thofe that demanded it, alfured biixij thfit they cams to demand it by the Queen'.^bf the Eaft Indies. Queen's Order, and offered their Receit of it in her Name ; but he, being more pod-' tive than wife, continued obilinate in hisRe- fafal, upon which the Queen gave him an Invitation to Court; and he, to appear great there, carried two of his Council, and fome others of the Fa^ory, with mod Part of the Military belonging to the Garilon, and, by Stratagem, they were all cut off, except a few black Servants, whole Heels and Lan guage faved them from the Maffacre, and thev brought the fad News of the Tragedy. Tegjiapatam, where the 'Dutch have a Fa- 4 ' 6lory, lies abotlt ii Leagues to the South ward of Aujengo. That Country produces Pepper, and coarfe Cloth called Catchas: But Colicha, which lies between the Middle; and W ell Point of the Cape Comer in, affords the beft Cloth of that Sort, befides Tama rinds in Abundance ; but the Road is foul. It alfo produces Salt; but neither the Eng- iijh nor 'Dutch have any Commerce or Traf- fick there. And dole by Colicha, at the laid middle Point, there is a fmall Cave or Har bour that can fecure fmall Veffels from alf Winds and Weather. It ha$ a clean fandy Bottom, and three Fathoms in it at low Wa ter. Four Leagues off the Cape, in the Sea^ there is a fmall fmooth Rock bare at low Wa ter, and Ihews itfelf like the Back of a Whale. About 100 Paces from it, on all Sides, there is i8 Fathom Water; and the Sea feldom breaks on it, which makes it the more dan gerous. I knew a Ship that rubbed her Side on ' :354. A neto Account on it, before thofe on board could difcov^t it, tho' they lookt out for it. Manafaar lies to the North-eaftward of Cape Comer in, about 8 Leagues diftant, and the Ttutch have a Fadory there, {landing on an high Ground about a Mile from the Sea. And about io Leagues more northerly is Tu- tec are en a 'butch Colony, tho' but frnall. Tutecareen has a good fafe Harbourj by the Benefit of fome fmall Iflands that ly off it. That Country produces much Cotton- cloth, tho' none fine; but they both ftain and die it for Exportation. This Colony fu- perintends a Pearl Fifhery, that lies a little to the Northward of them, which brings the Dutch Company 2 ,0000 L. yearly Tribute^ according to common Report. There are feveral Villages on the Sea-fliore between Tutecareen and Coil, but none in any Ac count for Traffick. This Coil is a Promon tory that fends over a Reef of Rocks to the Wand of Zeloan, called commonly .Adam\ Bridge. That Reef of Rocks has fo little Water on them, that the fmalleft Boats cannot pafs but at an Ifland called Manaar, which lies aim oft Mid-way between Zeloan and Coik and that Paflage has not above 6 Foot Wa ter on it, fo that none but fmall VelTels can pafs that Way; and they muft unlade* and pay Cuftoms to the Tttitch who refide at Ma~ naar, and, after the VefTel is haled over the Bridge, they take in their Cargo again.

The Tortugueze having Information of the 'Dutch landing, and the fmall Aftiftance of the Natives, contemned their Forces, and laifed an Army of ioooq Men to chaftife t Y thetf11% A new Account their Folly in coming with fo few Forces.' The Tortugneze Army was commanded by a Fidalgo, called Antonio de Figuera, a Freih- water Soldier, but a great Braggadocio, and promifed to bring all the Dutch that did not fall by his Sword, into Colombo in Chains; and the Tortugueze Ladies were fo fure of his Performances, that they fent to compli ment him, and beg the Favour that he would pick them out fome lufty DutchlSfan. to car ry their c Paleuqueens and Somereras or Um brellas, which he promifed to do on Ho nour, and fo went to meet his Enemies. The 'Butch advancing towards the City, met the Tortugueze unexpeftedly, and there being a little fliallow River between them, the T?oTttiQiicze pretended to itop the 'Dutch there, and began to fire very briskly, tho' at too great a Diltance, but did not advance towards their Enemy. Upon which the Dutch paft the River, and advanced till they came within Pfftol-fhot, and then fired on the 'Portugueze with lo good Succefs, that they prefently broke, and betook them to their Heels, and the Dutch kept a running March after them, and being nimbler than the 'Portugueze^ entred the City with them, and made thcmfelves Mafiers of it, wherein they found immenfe Treafures: But the poor 'Portuguese Ladies were itrangely dilappoin- ted to find the Dutch were become their Bed-fellows inftead of their Slaves. The Dutch had one Game more to play before they had done with that Expedition. Theyof the Eaft Indies. They knew that Reinforcements were lent from Go a, who came in Sight two or three Days after the City was taken, and the Uutch Fleet, which then lay m the Road, pretend ed Fear, weighed their Anchors on Sight of the Tortugueze Fleet, and feigned a Flight, while the 'Dittch^ in the City, hoyfted Tor- tugueze Colours, and fired fome Guns to wards the Sea, to make thofe in the Tortu gueze Fleet believe, that the Firing was at the Ttutch Fleet. The Stratagem took, and the Tortugueze came and anchored in the Road about a Mile from the City, and fent their Boats afliore, whefe they were detain ed ; and the Dutch Fleet being in the Offing, came in with the Sea Winds, and fell on the Tortugueze Fleet, which foon yielded to them/for which Piece of Civility they had good Quarter. Upon the Conquefl of Colombo^ followed all the other Forts on the Ifland, viz, Cal* kijjle and Barbarhiy between Colombo and Galley and, on the South End, Valta and Matura ; on the Eaft Side Bat aft la and frankamaldya ; and, on the North End, j^- naPataMy with a Fort 4 Leagues from Galley within Land, called Bible gain ; and Tuteca- reen and Nagapatam on the main Continentj yielded. The 'Dutch were no fooner Malters of the Sea-coafts of Ceyloan, but they began to give Laws to their Ally the King of Candia, forbidding him to trade with any foreign Na tion but theirs, which Ufage the King could f Y x * not54-° ^ ww Account not well digefl, whereupon a War broke onf, that continued many Years, but, in the End, the 'Dutch made a Peace upon very advanta- gious Conditions. And Qolombo being too jiiige to be defended with a few Forces, they ha\e contracted it into one Quarter of its an cient bounds, and have fortified it ilron^ly with a Wall and Baftions. It is now about a Mile in Length, and three Quarters of a Mile inLreadth; and the Chriftians and other Na tives inhabit a Part of the old Town, with out the Walls of the new. The Streets of the new 1 own are wide and fpacious, and the Buildings after the new Mode. The Go vernor s Houfe is a noble I^abrick, and feve- ral other Houfes are beautiful. It wants the Benefit of a River, but has a fmall deep Bay capable to receive fmall Ships, and Ihelter them in the South-weft Monfoons. . de Galle y I have mentioned before, is a Bay with a dangerous Entrance for Ship ping, but is capable to receive Ships of the greateit Burden. About the Year i6 7 o.Lew~ is XIV. of France had a great Mind for a Settlement on Zeloan, and equipt feven or eight Sail of Ships for that Enterprize ; and when thev came to Sea, and opened their Orders, they found Galle was the Place they were to take and fortify, and the Manage ment of that Affair intruded to one Mr. de L llaye y which one Mr. Jean Martin^ who had ierved the 'Dutch many Years in good Polls ^ JwduLy and who had laid down that Pro- jecl, v\ ab lo chagrin'd with the Difappoint- : mentof the Eaft Indies. 541 mcnt of another having the firit Pofl in that Affair, that when they came to Galle they had but bad Succefs. They expeded the 'Portugueze there before them to aflift, but none came; but foon after Hitlof Van Gouze was with them, whom the French not caring to engage with, being equal in Number of Ships, and fuperior in Force, the French fled, and left their Projed on Galle unattempted. They went then to Trankamalaya, and anchored in that Bay, defigning to force that fmall Garifon to a Surrender; but that vigilant 'Dutch Man was foon after them with his Fleet, and forced them to fight dif- advantgeoufly in Trankamalaya Bay, where in the French lofl one half of their Fleet, being cither funk or burnt. With the reft they fled to Si. Thomas, on the Coaft of defigning to fettle there ; but Van Gouze was foon there alfo, and feized their Ships, ma ny of their Guns being difmounted and car ried afhore: But they.finding they could do no Good againft fo powerful and vigilant an Enemy, treated and capitulated with the 'Dutch, to leave India, if they might be al lowed Shipping to carry them away, which the Dutch agreed to, and allowed them their Admiral's Ship, called ihz Grand Briton, undi two more, to tranfport themfelves whither they pleafed ; but Mr. Martin was carried to Batavia, and there confined for his Life time, with aPenfionof a Dollar/^r Day.

They catch them wild by Stratagem, and foon make them tame after they are caught. The Way they catch them, as they told me, is, they drive large Stakes into the Ground for x or 300 Paces, in a Plain, and, about 100 Paces diflant, they begin another Row of Stakes, that almott meets one of the Ends of the firll Row, only leaving 7 or 8 Foot open between them, for a Door, and far ther out from the Door-place, are fome Stakes driven thicker than in the Rows, like a fquare Chamber. In the Door-place is a wooden Portcullice or Trap-door, fitted to pull up or let down at Pleafure. When all is ready, they bring a female Elephant trained up for a Decoy, and Hie is put into the Cham ber, and the Trap-door kept open, There are Men placed in a little clofe Place built on the Top of the Stakes at the Trap-door, and the female Elephant makes a loud dole ful Mone. If a male Elephant is near, he prefemly approaches the Chamber, on the Outlide ; but finding no Entrance there, he walks along the Outfide, till he finds the End, then walking back on the Infide of the biakes, he finds the Door, and enters.

W hen he is tired with their Treatment, and finds no other Reme dy but Patience, he even grows tame, and walks very orderly between his two Guards, whit her loevci* they pleafe to conduct him, and continues very fociable ever after, except when Rutting Time comes, and then, 11 he be young, he becomes very rude and trou- blefom. That Time is known by a great Sweating in his Head, fo they have hmng Fetters ready to put on his Legs, andtaitne to a great Tree for eight or ten Days that his Madnefs continues. There are feveral Dangers, and KocKS above Water, on all the (Joafts of Zehan. The great Bax'tas are above Water on its Eall Side, not far from the South Lnd ot the liland ; and the fmail B are under VV a- ter about i Leagues to the North of the o- ther, and dangerous Banks ofSand within them. To the Northward of Trankutmalaya there are fome Rocks high above \V ater, and fome alfo under Water ; and feveral Spits ot Sand jetting a pretty VI ay into the Sea fiom Points of Lands. I knew a Gentleman that run his Ship on one Spit near Point Pedro, bv too much Confidence of his own Knou- ledge of that Coaft, for his Mate told him, that, in his Opinion, they kept too ncarihe ^ * 4 '^■MP h j new Account Shore. His Captain anfvvered, that his Know* ledge of that Coall was fo good, that if a fingle Shovel-ful of Sand was carried off the Sea-lhore, he would infallibly mifs it; but a few Minutes after, his Ship was fall on a Bank, and he and his Crew deferted her, and went afliore, and the Ship found the Way off again of her own Accord, which when the Captain heard of, he, with fome of the Crew, returned, and took Poffellion of her 3gain. Tedro has the moft dangerous Banks oil it, for they ly above four Leagues from the Shore, and the Land being very 3ow, makes thofe Banks the more dangerous. I have known feveral Ships loft there; and, in Anno 1723. one IV'tlliams loll his Ship there, and he and all his Crew were feized by the Natives, and carried to the King at Cajidia, and, I am afhiid, will be forced to end their Days there. The Religion of Zeloan is 'Paganifm, and, for want of a better Image or Relid to a- tlore, they worfhip a Monkey's Tooth. When the Tartugueze were fettled there, the Priefts loll their adorable Tooth, and a fly Fellow, who had accompanied a Tortugueze hxnhtfr fador there from Colombo, ■ pretended he had found it three Years after it was mifling. He had, it feems, feen it, and got one as like it as was poffible.

This Opinion is alfo fpread over many Provinces on the Conti nent, which brings many Pilgrims to vifit the Footilep. And they alfo believe, that, on Adam\ Tranfgreflion, the Bridge, before fpoken of, was made by Angels to carry him over to the main Land, whither I am obliged to follow him, having no more of Zeloan to treat you with, but fome of the bed Arecka in the World that grows there. CHAP. XXVIII Treats of the Countries on the Sea-coaft, from AdamV Bridge at Zeloan, to Fort St, George; with an Account of St. ThomasV Martyrdom j according to the Portugueze Legend. TH E firft Place of Note, to the North ward of Adams Bridge, on the Conti nent, is Nagapatam a ^Dutch Colony and For- trefs taken from the Tortugueze, It has the Benefit of a River, which formerly bounded the Dominions of Malabar^ the' their Lan guage was, and is ufed farther Northward, The River walhes the Fort Walls, and its ,Waters are reckoned very unhealthful; but about34-6 m:w ^ ccom t about the Year 1693. by thelngenuity and Care of Myn Heer Van Reede, whom I have formely mentioned, that Caufe of a mortal Malady was removed, for he built fome Wa ter Boats, and fent them 4 Leagues off to an other River, whofe Waters were reckoned very healthful, and, by thefe Boats, furnilh- ed the Garifon with good Water. In a Ihort Time there was a vifible Alteration for the better in the State of the Inhabitants Health, and making an Ellimate ot the C harges ot thofe Water Boats, and the ufual Charges of the Hofpital, the Company found that they gained by the Water Boats. This Colony produces very little befides Tobacco and long Cloth. The Natives are Heathens. Having thus run along the Sea-coafl: of Malabar^ from 'Decully to Magapatam, Imuft vifit the Maldiva lilands, which ly oft this Coaft and that of Zcloan, about 60 Leagues diftant from the nearell Part of them. This Clufter of Iflands, which reaches from 7 Degrees 20 Minutes North Latitude into 1 Degree South, are all low, fandy and fteril, bearing no Sort of Corn, and their on ly Produd is Cocoa-nut. Their Trees are not fo high nor grofs bodied as thofe which grow on the Continent, or on Zeloan, but their Fruit is pleafanter. Of that Tree they build Veffels of or 30 Tuns. Their Hulls, Mads, Sails, Rigging, Anchors, Cables, Provi- fions and Firing are all from this ufeful fi'ee. It alfo affords them Oyl for their Kitchin and Lamps, Sugar and candied Sweet-meats,of the Eaft Indies. ^47 and pretty ftrong Cloth. Their Seas pro duce Abundance of Fifti, but their Trade is chiefly from a fmall Shell-filli called Courie and the Bonetta. . The Courks are caught by putting Bran ches of Cocoa-nut Trees with their Leaves on, into the Sea, and, in five or fix Months the little Shell-fifli flicks to thofe Leayes^ in Clufters, which they take off, and digging Pits in the Sand, put them in, and cover them up, and leave them two 01 thicc \cais in the Pit, that the Fifli may putrify, and , then they take them out ot the Pit,^and bai ter them for Rice, Butter and Cloth, which Shipping bring from B alia fore in Ori^near Benval) in which Countries Courics pais ior Money from 2-5*00 to 3000 for a Rupee, or half a Crown Englijh. . , x T 1 . The Bonetta is caught with Hook and Line, or with Nets. Thev come among thole Iflands in the Months of Afril and May, in Sholes, as our Herrings do. 1 hey cut the Fifli from the Back -bone on each bide, and lav them in a Shade to dry, fprinkling them fometimes with Sea Water. When they are dry enough to put in the Sand, they wrap them up in Leaves of Cocoa-nut Tiecs, and put them a Foot or two under the Surface of the Sand, and, with the Heat of the oun, they become baked as hard as Stock-hm, and Ships come from Atcheen on the II and ot Suwatra,^ purchafethem with Gold Duit, I have feen Comelamajh (for that is their Name after^ ■ f 'a* f -Jr/ii II ■ »■ m 54.8 ^4 new after they are dried) fell at Atcheen, for 8 L.

The King refides on an Illand in the Latitude of 4 Degrees Norths and his Ifland, which bears the Name of the Kings IJland, is fortiried with a Stone Wall, without Lime or Morter, and has a great many fmall Cannon for his Defence. And his Reign is arbitrary. The Illands are lb many, and, in mofl Pla ces, fo near to one another, that they could never yet be numbred. They are mod Part inhabited ; but the Inhabitants very poor. None of them dare wear any Clothing above their Girdle, but a Turband on their Head, without a fpecial Warrant from the King. He lets Governors of Provinces over fuch a Number of Iflands, and they lord it over the poor Subjefts as much as a Dragoon does o- ver an Hugohot in France. They give Bu rial to their Dead, and not Burning. And, at the Illand t)f Hammandow, which lies in 7 Degrees, I faw Carving on fome Tomb-ftones, as ingenioufly cut with Variety of Figures as ever I faw in Europe or AJia. Their Wells furnifli them with all the Frelh-water they ufe, and they dig them near the Depth of high Water Mark, which is a- bout 5- or 6 Foot; and if they go deeper, it becomes brakifh, becaufe there being no Subilance of folid Earth under the Surface of the Sand, the Sea-water percolates thro' theof the Eaft Indies. ^49 the Sand, and mixes with the Rain-water that fupplies the Springs. So having given the belt Account I can of a Parcel of Illands that cannot be counted, I return back to Na- gafatam, from whence I took my Departure, and Iketch along the Coait of Chormondel. I begin at the River of Nagapatam, be- caufe it is the Ibuthermoft Bounds of Golcon- dahy and coaft along Shore to Trinetimbar a Fortreis and Colony belonging to the 'Banes. The Fort is ilrong, the Sea walhing one half of its Walls; but the Colony is milerably poor. In Anno 1684. they were fo diilreii with Po verty, that they pawn'd three Ballions of their Fort to the Ttutch, for Money to buy Pro- villons, which then was very fcarce and dear in that Country ; but next Year they redeem ed all again, paying their Debts by an un known Fund, which {till remains a Secret: But that the Englifh had a Ship called the Formofa, which, in her PaiTage Home to Sit' rat, called at Calecut for Water, Wood and other Stores. The 'Danes? at that Time, had two Ships cruizing between Surat and Cape Comer in, upon w^hat Account none could tell but. themfelves. The Form/a left Cale cut at Mid-night, and flood to Sea, in order to proceed on her Voyage, and being out of Sight of Land, about 11 in the Forenoon, thofe afhore heard a great firing of Cannon from the Sea, and the For mo fa, nor none of her Crew were ever heard of fince that Time. They flill keep their Fort, but drive an inconfiderable Trade either to and from Eu~ \ 1350 A new Account Europe, or in Ind'ta, for what they have to live by, is the Hire that they freight their Ships for to Atcheen, Malacca and Johore, and fometimes, but rarely, to 'Perjia, by which they keep up the Name of a Compa ny, but refemble one no more than that of the MiJJiJJift does in France. They have a Set of Clergy there lately come as MifTioners from 'Denmark, to teach the Natives Chriftiamty, which deferves both Commendation and Encouragement, but what Profelytes they make, I cannot tell, tho' I faw fome of the poorer Sort become Difciples. The Product of the Country is Cloth, white and dyed. The next Place of Commerce is Torto Novo, fo called by the Tortugueze, when the Sea-coafts of India belonged to them ; but when Aurengzeb fubdued Golcondah, and the Tortugueze Affairs declined, the Mogul fet a Fouzdaar in it, and gave it the Name of Mahomet Bander. The Europeans gene rally call it by its firft Name, and the Natives by the laft. The Country is fertil, healthful and pleafant, and produceth good Cotton Cloth of feveral Qualities and Denominations, which they fell at Home, or export to Tegu, Tanafereen, Quedah, 'jobore, and Atcheen on Sumatra, The Bulk of the People are Ta- gans. Fort St. David is next, a Colony and Fortrefs belonging to the Engl'ijh. About the Year 1686. a Moratta Prince fold it to Mr. Elthu Tale, for 90000 Tagodoes, for the Ufeof the Eaft Indies. Ufe and Behoof of the Enghjh Eaft-india Company. The Fort is pretty llrong, and Itands clofe to a River; and the Territories annext to the Fort by Agreement, were as far as any Gun the Enghjh had, could fling a Shot, every Way round the Fort; but whether the Buyer or Gunner were Conjur ers or no, I cannot tell, but I am fure that the Engltjh Bounds reach above 8 Miles a- long the Sea-fliore, and 4 Miles within Land, The Country is pleafant, healthful and fruit ful, watered with feveral Rivers, that are as good as fo many Walls to fortify the Englijb Colony. And ever fince the Time that Au~ rengzeb conquered Vifapore and Golcondah t there are great Numbers of Malcontents and Freebooters that keep on the Mountains, arid often fall down into the open Country, and commit Depredations, by ravaging and plun- dring the Villages v and all the Mogitl\ for ces cannot fupprefs them. When the Englijh bought Fort St. 'Da vid, the Dutch had a little Vapory there, a- bout a Mile from the Fort, and the good- natured Engltjh fuflfer them ftill to continue a few Servants in it. Our Company did not find fo much Grace from the Dutch at Con- chin, nor the Gentlemen of Bantam and In- drapouray when the Dutch feiied thofe Pla ces. It is true, the Dutch drive no o- pen Trade there, but what they muft pay the Englijh Company Cuiloms for. Abo ^ t the Year 1698. the Freebooters a- forementioned had almoft made themfelves Ma-nemo Account Mailers of the Fort by Stratagem ahd Sur prize. They pretended, that they had been lent from the Mogul's Vice-roy at Vifapore, to take Charge of the Revenue collefted at 'Porto Novoy and to carry it to the Treafu- ry at V'tfapore^ and defired Leave to put their feigned Treafure into the Fort for a few Days, to fecure it from the Moratta Freebooters aforementioned, who, they faid, were plundring the open Country, which Favour Mr. Frazer, Governor at that Time, granted, fo they brought into the Fort ten or twelve Oxen loaded with Stones, and each Ox had two or three Attendants, and about 200 more of that Gang, who came a- long with the Carriage Beails as a Guard, lodged themfelves in a Grove near the Fort Gate, to be ready, on a Signal given, to enter the Fort. The Freebooters within took an Op portunity the very next Morning, and killed the Sentinel and a few more that were afleep in the Gate-way next to the Grove; bur, before they could break the Gate open, the Garifon was alarmed, and killed all their treacherous Guefts, and the Ambufli without being come into the Parade before the Gate, met with fo warm a Reception, that they retreated in Confufion, and the Engiijh pur- fuing them, killed feverals, but loll lome of their own Men. M r . Frazer ordered diredfty the Grove to be cut down, for fear of future Danger from it, but Fort St. c Dav'td being fubordi- nate to Fort St, GeorgBy the Governor and Council /of the Eaft Indies. 3 ^ Council there called Mr. Frazer to theif Court, and fined him for Prefumption, in cutting down fo fine a Grove for Enemies to fculk in, without Leave askt and given ill due Form ; but their Right Honourable Ma ilers adjufted all that Matter, and ordered the Fine to be refounded, with the Intercity but Governors of different Views and Hu^ mours feldom agree. This Colony produces good long Cloths in large Quantities, either brovyn, white, or blue dyed, alfo Sallampores, Morees, '■Demi-* ties. Ginghams 1 Snccatoons; arid Steel. And, without the Afliftance of this Colony, that of Fort St. George would make buc a fmall Figure in Trade to what it now does. The River is but fmall, tho' very conve nient for the Import and Export of Merchan dize. And Ctiddelore, that lies about a Mile to the Southward, is capable to receive Ship's of xoo Tuns in the Months of September and Otfober. The Rivers have both of them Bars, but are very fmooth, whereas Fort Sr. George is alwavs dangerous in going afhore and coming off. The Company has a pretty good Garden and Summer-houfe, where generally the Go vernor refides; and the Town extending it- felf pretty wide, has Gardens to molt of their Houfes. Their black Cattle are very fmall, but plentiful and cheap. And their Seas and Rivers abound in good Fifhes. Tunttcherry is the next Place of Note on this Coaft, a Colony fettled by the French, t z *^54 ^ necw '^• CCOHn ^ It lies about 5 Leagues to the Northward of Fort St. 'David. The Fortifications are fine, regular and ftrong, but its Tiade is ^eiy fmall, tho' the Country produces the lame Commodities that caufe the Trade circulate in Fort St. 'David. About the Year 1690. the Dutch brought Forces from Bataviay and befieged it, and being then very fcarce in Men, Magazines and Money, the French were forced to capitulate, and fuirendei on pretty honourable Terms, but, in theCon- clufion of King Williams War, the Dutch were obliged to return ^/ r ^ tl( :l cs P Peace, which verified the Fable of thcCuck- ow in feizing of other Birds Nefts weaker than herfelf, in the Spring, and quitting them again in Autumn. 1 . Connywere or Conjemeer is the next 1 iace, where the Englijh had a Faaory many Years, but, on their purchafmg Fort St. David, it was broken up, and transferred thithei. At prefent its Name is hardly feen in the Map of Trade. d N ear Connymere are the feven 1 ago as, one of which, whofe Name I have now for got, is celebrated among the c Paga7is 101 Sandity, and is famous for the yearly Pilgn- maffes made there. The God was very oh- fcene, if his Image rightly reprefents him, and his Nymphs as lewd as any in Drury-lane, if their Pottures were really figured and car ved as they are to be feen on the Oatlide 01 the Temple. Here it was that St. Thomas s Perfecution firft began, becaufe lie could diaw * . aof the Eaft Indies. 555 a fhoit Tree to a great Length, as Wire- drawers do Metals, and the Tagan Priefts being ignorant of fuch Pieces of Art, made them cry out, that St. Thomas was an arrant Conjurer; for, as the Romijh Story goes., the Frefhes coming down in Rivulets, had made fome of them pretty deep to what they ufed to be, and a Lady going to Church, could not get over one of them, becaufe a Tree, that was laid for a common Bridge, was too fliort at that Time, and St. Thomas^ who preached in the Country Villages, a Dodnne oppofite to the eftabliihed Church, accidentally being there, drew the Tree to fuch a Length, that the Lady could pafs without wetting her Foot, upon which flie became a Convert, to the great Dilfatisfadi- on of the eftablifhed Clergy^ who loft a de vout and charitable Benefadrefs by that Trick of St. Thomas's. The Priefts, as is ufual in fuch Cafes, cri ed out, that the Church was in Danger, and fo inflamed the Minds of the Populace, that St. Thomasi finding himfelf in greater Danger than the Church, thought it beft to get out of Harm's W ay, and fo marched to the North- 8 ward, whither I mud follow him to Saderafs, or Saderafs Tat am, a fmall Fa- ftory belonging to the 'Dutch to buy up long Cloth. The Country is healthful, and the Ground fertil, which make them capable of aflifting their Neighbours at Fort St. George with Sallading and Pot Herbsj the Ground there being very fteril. t Z % Caht*5_A nm Account Cabeloit is next, where the Oft enters have? fettled a Faaory.

The City was built by the Tortuguezc, and they made the Apoflle its Godfather &gt; but, before that, it was called Malltapore. rhcic is a little dry Rock on the Land, within if, called the Little Mount, where the Apoltle defianed to have hid himfelf, till the t-uryof the 'Pa-rm Priefts his Perfecutors had blown over. There was a convenient Cave in that Rock for his Purpofe, but not one Drop ot Water to drink, fo St. Thomas cleft the Rock with his Hand, and commanded W ater to come into the Clift, which Command it rea dily obeyed ; and, ever lince, theie is vj ater in that Clift, both fweet and clear. \\ hen I faw it, there were not above 3 Cations in it. He (laid there a few Days, but his Ene mies had an Account of his Place of Re uge, and were refolved to facrificc him, and, in great Numbers, were approaching the Mount. When he faw them coining, he left his Lave, and came down in order to leek Shelter lomc where elfe ; and, at the Foot of the Mount, as a Teilimony that lie had been iheie, he ftampt with his bare Foot, on a very hau Stone, and left the Print of it, which remains there, to this Day, a \V itncls agaiuit tuoK per-of the Eaft Indies. perfecuting Priefts.

FORT St. George or Maderafsy or, as the Natives call it, China 'Patam, is a Colony and City belonging to the Englijh Eaft-india Company, fituated in one of the molt incommodious Places I ever faw. It fronts the Sea, which continually rolls impe- tuoufly on its Shore, more here than in any other Place on the Coaft of Chormondel. The Foundation is in Sand, with a Salt-water Ri ver on its back Side, which obftruds all Springs of Frefti-water from coming near the Town, fo that they have no drinkable Water within a Mile of them, the Sea often threatning Deftrudion on one Side, and the River in the rainy Seafon Inundations on the other, the Sun from April to September fcor- ching hot; and if the Sea-breefes did not moi- ften and cool the Air when they blow, the place could not poffibly be inhabited. The Heafon why a Fort was built in that Place isof the Eaft Indies. 359 not well accounted for; but 1 radition lays» that the Gentleman, who received his Or- ders to build a Fort on that Coall, about the Bednninff of KingCharles Il's. Reign after his Reftauration, for proteding the C^any s Trade, chofe that Place to ruine the '1 or,u- oueze Trade at St. Thomas. Others again al- ledge, and with more Probability, that the Gentleman aforefaid, which I take to be Sir Wtlliam Lanvhorn, had a Miftns at St. Tho mas he was fo enamoured ot, that made hini build there, that their Interviews might be the more frequent and uninterrupted; but whatever his Reafons were, it is ^ CI V 1 1 tuated. The Soil about the City is o dry and fandv, that it bears no Corn, and what truits. Roots and Herbage they have, are brought to Maturity by great Pains and much liou- ble. If it be true, that the Company gave him Power to fettle a Colony in any 1 art ot that Coaft that pleafed him beft, I wonder that he choolcd not Cabelon, aoout 6 Ceague to the Southward, where the Ground is er- til and the Water good, with the Conyem- encv of a Point of Rocks to facilitate Boats landing, or why he did not go nine Leagues farther northerly, and fettle at the Banks of a good River, as the 'Dutch have done fince, where the Road for Ship pin' is made eafy by iome Sand Banks, that reach s Leagues off Shore, and make the hi o h turbulent Billows that come rolling from the Sea, fpend their 1'orce on toe Banks before they can reach the Shore. 1 ne _ . X 4%6q A new Account Soil is good, and the River commodious, and convenient in all Seafons. Now whether one of thofe Places had not been more eligible, I leave to the Ingenious and thofe concerned to comment on. H owever, the War carried on at Ben* gal and Bombay, by the Enghjh againit the Mogul's Subjeds, from 1685 to 1689. made Fort St. George put on a better Drefs than he ^vore before ; for the peaceable Indian Merchants, who hate Contention and War, came flocking thither, bccaufe it lay far from j thofe Incumberers of Trade, and near the Diamond Mine? of Golcondah, where there are, many Times, good Bargains to be made, ^nd Money got by our Governors. The black Merchants reforting to our Colony, to le- cure their Fortunes, and bring their Goods to a fafe Market, made it populous and rich, notwithflanding its natural Inconveniencies. The Town is divided into two Parts. One where the Europeans dwell is called the white Town. It is walled quite round, and has feveral Bailions and Bulwarks to defend its Walls, which can only be attacked at its Ends, the Sea and River fortifying its Sides. It is about 400 Paces long, and 15-0 Paces broad, divided into Streets pretty regular, and Fort St. George Hood near its Center. There are two Churches in it, one for the Englijh, and anpther for the Romijh Service. The Governor fuperintends both, and, in filling up Vacancies in the Romijh Church, is (he Pope's Legate a latere in Spirituali- de|of the Eaft Indies. ties. There is a very good Hofpital in the Town, and the Company's Horfe-ftables are neat ; but the old College, where a great many Gentlemen Favors are obliged to lodge, is ill kept in Repair. T hey have a Town-hall, and underneath it are Prifons for Debtors. They are, or were a Corporation, and had a Mayor and Aldermen to be chofen by the free Burgers of the Town; but that fcurvy Way is grown obfolete, and the Governor and his Council pr Party fix the Choice. The City had Laws and Ordinances for its own Prefervation, and a Court kept in Form, the Mayor and Alder men in their Gowns, with Maces on the Table, a Clerk to keep a Regitter of Tranf- aftions and Cafes, and Attornies and Solici tors to plead in Form, before the Mayor and Aldermen ; but, after all, it is but a Farce, for, by Experience, 1 found, that a few Ta- go does rightly placed, could turn the Scales of Jullioe to which Side the Governor pleaf- ed, without Refpeft to Equity or Reputation. I n fmaller Matters, where the Cafe, on both Sides, is but weakly fupported by Mo ney, then the Court a61s judicioufly, accor ding to their Confcienccs and Knowledge; but often againfl Law and Reafon, for the Court is but a Court of Confcience, and its Decifions are very irregular; and the Gover nor's difpenfmg Power of nulling all that the Court tranfads, puzzles the moll celebrated Lawiers there to find Rules in the flatute t^aws, T he v2(52. A new They have no martial Law, fo they can not inflid: the Pains of Death any other Ways than by whipping or ftarving, only for Pira cy they can bang; and fome of them have been fo fond of that Privilege, that Mr. Tale hanged his Groom ( Crofs) for riding two or three Days Journey off to take the Air; but, in England, he paid pretty well for his arbitrary Sentence. And one of a later Date, •Z/'i-s. the orthodox Mr. Collet hung d. a Youth who was an Apprentice to an Officer on board of a Ship, and his Matter going a pi rating, carried his Servant along with him; but the Youth ran from them the firft Op portunity he met with, on the Illand of Jonk- ceyloan, and informed the Matter of a Sloop, which lay in a River there, that the Pirates had a Defign on his Sloop and Cargo, and went armed, in Company with the Matter, to hinder the Approach of the Pirates, and was the firtt that fired on them, yet that mer ciful Man was inexorable, and the Youth was hang'd. That Power of executing Pirates is fo flrangely ttretched, that if any private Trad er is injured by the Tricks of a Governor, and can find no Redrefs, if the injured Per- fon is fo bold as to talk of Lex talionis, he is infallibly declared a Pirate. lit Anno I went on a trading Voyage to Siam y on the Foundation of a Treaty of Commerce ettablifhed in Anno 1684. between King Charles and the King of Siams Ambaf- fador at London ; but, in Anno 1718. Mr.Cb/- letof the Eaft Indies. 3^5 let fent one Downey his Arnbnllador to Siattiy with full Power to annul the old Treaty, and to make a new one detrimental to all Britijh Subjects, except thofe employed by Co Met himfelf. It was ftipulated, that all Britijh Subjects that had not Collefs Letter, Ihould be obliged to pay 8 per Cent, new C^uiloms, and Meafurage for their Ship, which come to about 500 L- for a Ship ot 3°° Tuns, to fell their Cargoes to whom they pleafed, but the Money to be paid into the King s Cafh, that he might deliver Goods for it at his own Prices, whether proper for their homewaid Markets, or no. I coming to Siam, fent my fecond Supercargo up to the City, with Or ders to try the Market, and hire an Home for the Ufe of the Cargo and ourfelves. He could not get a Boat to bring him back,^ be fore the Ship arrived at Bencock^ a Caftle a- bout half-way up, where it is cuftomary for all Ships to put their Guns afliore, fo then •being obliged to proceed with the Ship to the City, I underftood the Conditions of the new Treaty of Commerce, which I would, by no Means, adhere to, but defired Leave to be gone again. 1 hey ufed many Peifwa- fions to make me llay, but to no Purpole, unlefs I might trade on the old and lawtul Treaty They kept me from the Beginning of Augnft to the latter End of Ttecember, before they would let me go, and then I was obliged to pay Meafurage before they parted with me, tf . ft 1 5 &lt;54 A new A . I wrote my Grievance to Mr. Collet, com plaining of 'Powney's villanous Tranfadions, not feeming to know that they were done by Collefs Order, and let fome Hints fall of Lex talionis, if I met with Towney conveni ently, which fo vext Mr. Collet, that he for mally went to the Town-hall, and declared me a rank Pirate, tho'I and my Friends came off with above 3000 L. Lofs. I fhould not have been fo particular, but that I faw fome printed Papers at London, in Anno 1715. that extolled his Piety, Charity and Juftice in very high Encomiums; but it muft have been done by fome mercenary Scribler that did not know him; but now he is dead, I'll fay no more of him. T h e black Town is inhabited by Gentows, Mahometans and Indian Chriftians, viz. Ar menians, and Portuguese, where there are Temples and Churches for each Religion, e- very one being tolerated ; and every one follows his proper Employment. It was wal led in towards the Land, when Governor Pit ruled it. He had fome Apprehenfion, that the Mogul's Generals in Golcondah might, fome Time or other, plunder it, fo laying the Hazard and Danger before the Inhabi tants, they were either perfwaded or oblig ed to raile Subfidies to wall their Town, ex cept towards the Sea and the white Town. The two Towns are abfolutely governed by the Governor Sola, in whofe Hands the Command of the Military is lodged ; but all ^•ther Allairs belonging to the Company, are manag-of the Eaft Indies, inanagcd by him and his Council, moil Part of whom are generally his Creatures. And I have been and am acquainted with fome Gentlemen, who have been in that Poft, as well as fome private Gentlemen, who refided at Fort Si. George, Men of great Candor and Honour, but they feldom continued long Favourites at Court. One of the Gates of the white Town looks towards the Sea, and it is, for that Reafon, called the Sea-gate. The Gate-way being pretty fpacious, was formerly the com mon' Exchange, where Merchants of all Na tions relorted about n a Clock, to treat of Bufinefs in Merchandize; but that Cuftom is out of Fafhion, and the Confultation Cham ber, or the Governor's Apartment ferves for that Ufe now, which made one Captain Hart, a very merry Man, fay, that he could never have believed that the Sea-gute could have been earned into the (^onjiiltation Roow, if he had not feen it. The Company has their Mint here for coining Bullion that comes from Europe and other Countries, into Rupees, which brings them in good Revenues. The Rupee is ftampt with Terfian Characters, declaring the Mo- gufs Name, Year of his Reign, and fome of his Epithets. They alfo coin Gold into Ta-* go does of feveral Denominations and Value. There are alfo Schools for the Education of Children, the Englijh for Reading and Wri ting Englijh, the Tortugueze for their Lan guage and Latin, and tiie Mahometans, Gen~$66 A new Account tows, and Armenians for their particular Languages. And the Englijh Church is well endowed, and maintains poor Gentlewomen in good Houfewifery, good Clothes and Ta* lankines. The Diamond Mines being but a Week's Journey from Fort Sx.. George, make them pret ty plentiful there; but few great Stones are now brought to Market there, fince that great Diamond which Governor^P/Vfent to England. How he purchafed it Mr. Glover, by whofe Means it was brought to the Governor, could give the beft Account, for he declared to me, that he loft 3000 T* ago does by introducing the Seller to Mr. Tit, having, left fo much 4 Money in Arc at as Security, that if the Stone was not fairly bought at Fort St. George, the Owner fhould have free Liberty to carry it where he pleafed for a Market; but neither the Owner nor Mr. Glover were pleafed with the Governor's Tranfadions in that Affair. Some Cuftoms and Laws at the Mines are, when a Perfon goes thither on that Affair, he choofes a Piece of Ground, and acquaints one of the King's Officers, who flay there for that Service, that he wants fo many Covets of Ground to dig in; but whether they agree for fo much, or if the Price be certain, I know not: However, when the Money is paid, the Space of Ground is inclofed, and fome Sentinels placed round it. The Kins challenges all btones that are found above a certain Weight, I think it is about 60 Grains; and if any Stones be carried clandeftinely a- wayof the Eaft Indies. ^6-} way above the flipulated Weight, the Per- fon guilty of the Theft, is puniihed with Death. Some are fortunate, and get Eftates by digging, while others lofe both their Mo ney and Labour. T he current Trade of Fort St. George runs gradually flower, the Trader meeting with Difappointments, and fometimes with Oppreilions, and fometimes the Liberty of buying and felling is denied them; and I have feen, when the Governor's Servants have bid for Goods at a publick Sale, fome who had a Mind to bid more, durft not, others who had more Courage and durftbid, were brow beaten and threatned. And I was Witnefs to a Bargain of Stir at Wheat taken out of a Gentleman's Hands, after he had fairly bought it by Audion, fo that many trading People are removed to other Parts, where there is greater Liberty and lefs Oppreilion. T he Colony produces very little of its own Growth or Manufa&amp;ure for foreign Mar kets, They had formerly a Trade to Tegu, where many private Traders got pretty good Bread by their Traffick and Induflry; but the Trade is now removed into the Armeni ans, Moors and Gentows Hands, and the Eng- lijh are employed in building and repairing of Shipping. The Trade they have to Chi na, is divided between them and Surat, for the Gold, and fome Copper, are for their own Markets, and the Grofs of their Cargo, which confifts in Sugar, Sugar-candy, Allom, China Ware and fome Drugs, as China Root, Galling* \k36S A ne-w Account Galling-gal, &amp;c. are all for the Mai'- ker. Their Trade to Terfia mufl firft come down the famous Ganges^ before it can come into 1'ort St. Georges Chanels to be convey-* ed to 'P er/la. They never had any Trade to Mocha in the Produd: and Manufadories of ChormondeL before the Year 171 3. and Fort St. David fupplies the Goods for that Port, fo that Fort St. George is an Emblem of Hollandm. fupplying foreign Markets with foreign Goods. The Colony is well peopled, for there is computed to be 80000 Inhabitants in the Towns and Villages; and there are general ly about 4 or 500 Europeans refiding there, reckoning the Gentlemen, Merchants, Sea men and Soldiery. Their Rice is brought, by Sea, from Ganjam and Orixa, their Wheat from Surat and Bengal, and their Fire-wood from the Illands of T^iu, a low Point of Land that lies near Matchultpatamy fo that any E* nemy that is fuperior to them in Sea Forces, may eafily diftrefs them. C H A P #of the Eaft Indies. CHAP. XXX. Gives an Account of the Co aft of Chormon- del from Fort St. George to Ganjam, the eaftermoft Town in the ancient Kingdom of Golcondah; with Obfervations on their Pagan IVor/hip, and feme Occurrences that happened to the Englilh Faftory at Viza- gapatam while I was there. POLICAT the next Place of Note to the City and Colony of Fort St. George, and, as I obferved before, is a Town belong ing to the 'Dutch. It is ftrengthned with two Forts, one contains a few Dutch Soldiers for a Garifon, the other is commanded by an Officer belonging to the Mogul. The Country affords the fame Commodities that Fort St. George doth ; and the People are em ployed moftly in knitting Cotton Stockings, which they export for the Ufe of all the Eu ropean Factories in India. There are feveral Places along the Coaft to the Northward, which, in former Times, had Commerce abroad, but now are negle cted and unfrequented. Armagun is one, and Kifnipatam is another, that brought good Store of Cloth, of feveral Sorts, to the En^- lijh Fadories. Kifnipatam has the Benefit of a good large River, that has a Bar of 15-Foot W ater on it. Carrera has the Benefit of a large River, that reaches a great Way into the Country. Tettipoly had once Englifb and Dutch Fadtories fettled in it, but were with- t A a drawnAnew Account drawn many Years ago, becaufe the inland Rajahs diflurbed Commerce by their Impo- fitions and Exadions. Mat chilif at being the next 1 lace or Figure, lies in the Way along the Sea-coait. It fkndson the North-eail Side of Point, about f Leagues ditlant from it. In the lat ter Part of the laft Century^ this I own was one of the mod flourifhing in all India, and the Englijh Company found it to be the mofl profitable Faftory that they Fhey had a large Faftory built ot I eak Timber; but now there are no Engltjh there, tho the 'Dutch continue their Fadory Hill, and keep about a Dozen of Hollanders there to carry on the Chint Trade, for that Commodity is not, as yet, forbid to appear m Holland Xhe T own is but fmall, built on a little Ifland, and is much flronger by Nature than Art. Towards the Continent Side, there is a deep Morafs, over which is a wooden Bridae about half a League long, and on breaking a Part of that Bridge, the Town is fecured from Enemies on the Land bide. The Mo^ul has his Cuftom-houle here, and the Commiffioner of the Cuilom-houfe is Governor of the Town The Country and adjacent Iflands are fruitful m Gram, Timber for building, and Tobacco the belt in India. The Iflands of 7)iu produce the famous Dye called Shan. It is a Shrub grow- in^ in Grounds that are overflown with the Spring -tides. It ftains their Calicoes in the moll beautiful and lively Colours in theW orld;of the Eaft Indies. and I have feen Butter from thence of as good a Colour andTalte as ever I faw m Eu rope. A few Years ago, the Nabob or Vice-roy of Chormondely who refides at Cmckactil, and who fuperintends that Country for the Mo gul, for fome Difguft he had received from the Inhabitants of Tliu Iflands, would have 1 made a Prefent of them to the Colony of Fort St. George, and the Inhabitants were ve- 1 ry willing to change their Mailers; but cer tain Reafons, that I am unacquainted with, made the Governor and his Council rejeft the Prefent, and the Vice-roy and the Iflan-^ ders became Friends again; but, after a Year or two, the Englijh having confidered bet ter of the Matter, would accept of the Vice- 4 roy's Profer, and fent fome Ships, with Men and Ammunition, to fortify a Factory, but the Inhabitants took Arms, and forbad them to land, fo they returned as they went a- broad. Next to Matchulipatam is Narfipore, where the Englijh had a Faftory for long Cloth, for the Ufe of their Faftory of Mat- chulifatam, when they manufactured Qhinti there. It alfo affords good Teak Timber for building, and has a fine deep River, but a dangerous Bar, which makes it little frequen ted. And paiFing round Cor ran go Point, a little Way up in Cor ran go Bay, is Anger ang, that has the Benefit of a large deep River, that penetrates far up into the Continent. Ic has a Bar foft at the Bottom, and three and | A a i372, A ne r dd Account an half Fathoms on it at high Water. Here the belt and fineft long Cloth is made that India affords, and is fold cheap ; but the in land Countries lying near the River, are in the Hands of different Rajahs^ and each be^ ing Sovereign in his own fmall Dominions, makes fuch Impofitions and Exactions on the Cloth that comes down the River, that they ruine that beneficial Trade otylngerang, and make it little frequented. In Anno 1708. the Englijhy from Vizaga* pat am ftttlcd there; but whether the Facto ry wasitarved for Want of Money, or whe ther the Conftituent and conflituted Chiefs of the Faftories difagreed about dividing the Bear's Skin, I know not, but the Faftory was foon withdrawn, and the Projcd loil. C oasting along Shore, there are feveral little Ports between MaUhulifatam and Vi~ zagapatam^ befides Narjipore and Angerang, but fVatrawis the molt noted, for it produ ces Rice for Exportation, befides fome long Cloth, but it is not frequented by Europeans, and therefore I proceed to Vizagapatam, a fortified Fadory belonging to the Engltfh. It is regularly fortified with four little Baltions, and has about 18 Guns mounted in it. It has the Advantage of a River, but a dangerous Bar to pafs over be fore we get into k. The Country about af fords Cotton Cloths, both coarfe and fine, and the belt TDureas^ or ftript Muflins, in /«- dia ; but the Fatlory is generally heart-fick for want of Money to refrefh it.of the Eaft Indies. 575 In Anno 1709. the Faftory drew a War on themfelves from the Nabob of Chickacul^ for one Mr. Simeon Holcomb^ who had been Chief at Vizagapatam, had borrowed confiderable Sums of the Nabob, and affixt the Company 's Seal to the Bonds he gave for them. Mr. Mo I comb dying, the Nabob demanded his Mo ney from the fucceeding Chief, who would not pay him, alledging, that Holcomb had borrowed it for his own private Ufe, and not for the Company's, and that he muit get Payment out of HoUomb's private Eftate, if there was enough found to pay the Debt, o- therwife he might get his Money from fome inland Rajahs, who flood indebted to //(?/- comb, by his Books of Accounts, in a great er Sum than would pay his Principal and In- terefl; and that he being the Mogul's Gene ral, could compel thofe Rajahs to pay their juft Debts, which they would make over to him: But the Nabob, not caring to enter in to a War with his Country-men on fuch a Foundation, fent Agents to acquaint the Go vernor and Council of Fort St. George, with his Affairs at Vizagafatam. They proved deaf to all the Agent's Propofitions and Ar guments, and hardly treated him civilly, fo he went back to his Mailer, with the Account of his ill Succefs. Upon which the Nabob came to a Garden about half a League front Vizagafatam, accompanied with 5-00 Horfe, and 35-00 Foot, to demand his Money. I be ing accidentally there in a fmall 'Duhh-hmXx. Ship s that I had bought from the French, on A a 5 my3 74 ^ nerw ■^ ccom ^ my Credit, at Fort St. George, and the Fa- ^lory being but ill mann'd, Mr. Haft in who was then Chief, and my Friend, defired the Afliftance of my Arms and Counfel in that Jundure of Aftairs, which I very freely gave him ; and my Opinion being askt in Council, what I thought about the Affair, I adviied him and his Council to compound the Mat ter as well as they could, and fpin out Time, that we might better fortify the Avenues to the Faftory. My Advice of compounding the Matter was rejected, but the other Part we followed, fo, with feven Europeans that belonged to the Factory, and twelve that were with me, and twenty Tofafes, and 180 Natives, mod of them Fiihers, that lived un der the Company's Protedion, we fortified fome Rocks that the Enemy w^as obliged to pafs within Piftol-lhot of, if they had a Mind to attack us. We threw up Breail-works be tween the Rocks, and moored my Ship with in Piftol-fhot of the Shore, and had eight minion Guns to fcour the Sands, if they had attempted to come that Way, and, for lix W 7 eeks we continued on our Guard, and were often alarmed in the Night, but find ing us always ready to receive them, they did not think it proper to force an Entry into the Town, I had the Honour to command all the Out- guards, and the Chief, with eight Europeans and twenty Blacks, kept the Fort. Thus we continued in perpetual Watchings and Alarms, {ill Reinforcements arrived from Fort St, George^of the Eaft Indies. 375 Georve, and then I left them, and proceeded on a Voyage to Tegu. Both Parties being very bufy, one ftriving to get his Money by Compulfion, and the other, to fave the Com pany's Money on any Terms, right or wrong The War being drawn to a greater Lengtn than was imagined at firft, and Charges i iling higher than was expected, inclined t ^ e ™'P make all up amicably, which was at lail c - feftcd by the Company's paying near the bum that was at firll demanded. „ ,. , The Nabob, whofe Name was Faktrly Cawn, would hear of no Peace, without the Company's Merchant, who was a Gfntow called Atapa, and a Subjeft of the_ Moguls, who was very aftive in the War, in encou raging the Town's People to defend them- felves and the Company's Intereft, and who alfo had wrote to fome neighbouring to embroil the Nabob's Affairs m his Abfence, in order to divert him from purfuing his Uc- mands on Viz.agafatam, Ihould be delivered up to him, which, at laft, he was, and was put to a very cruel Death. He was fet m the hot fcorching Sun three Days, with .us Hands faftned to a Stake oyer his Head, and one of his Legs tied up till his Heel touch ed his Buttock, and, in the Night, put into a Dungeon, with fome venomous Snakes to bear him Company, and this was repcied till the third Night he ended his miferable Life; but the Company's Merchants, for thefutuie, will be cautious how they efpouic the Com- ranv's Interell again. r - \ a 4 Theri37^ ^ new Account: T here was one Bally, a Recruit from rort Sr. George, on fome Difcontent, defer- ted the Company's Service, and entred into the Nabob's; but falling into an Ambuili, was taken PnToner by our Men, and was lent to Fort St. George, where, for his De- fertion, he was defervedly whipt out of this world intp the next, and there I leave him. A fter the War was ended, and all qui et, the Nahoh returned to ChickacuL, but could neither forget nor forgive his Treat- rnent at Fort St. George and Vtzagapatatn, but finding by Force he could not get the rariory into his Hands, without great L.ofs of Men and Money, he had Recourfe to Stra tagem, by furprifing it. He came into the Town one Day with icq Horfe, and fome Foot, without advertifing of his coming, as wasufual, at the Town-gate, and before the Chief could have Notice, he was got into the Faftory, with twenty or thirty of his At tendants. The Alarm being given, a refo- lute bold young Gentleman, a Factor in the Company's Service, called Mr. RichtrdHor- came running down Stairs, with hisFu- xee in his Hand, and his Bayonet fcrewed on its Muzzle, and, prefenting it to the Nabob's Breafl; told him in the Gentow Language, (which he was Mailer of) that the Nabob was welcom, but ifanyol his Attendants offe- red the lealt Incivilit}^, his Life fliould an- fwer for it. The Nabob was furprifingly a- ironiined at the Relolution and Bravery of {he young Gentlemanj and fat down to con- lide^of the Eaft Indies. ^77 (ider a little, Mr. Harden keeping the Muzzle of his Piece flill at his Brealt, and one of the Nabob's Servants Handing all the While be hind Mr.with a Dagger's Point clofe to his Back, fo they had a Conference of half an Hour long, in thofe above mention ed Poftures, and then the Nabob thought fit to be gone again, full of Wonder and Ad miration of fo daring a Courage. T here are many ancient Pagods or Tem ples in this Country, but there is one very particular that itands upon a little Mountain near Vtzagapatam^ where they worfliip liv ing Monkies; and, by Report, many Hun dreds breed there, which are nouriflied by the zealous Priefts, whofe Devotion confiiis moftly in boyling Rice and other Food for their comical little Gods, which, at Meal times, alTemble at the Pagod, and eat what is prepared for them, and retire again in good Order; but it is lefs dangerous to kill a Man near that Temple than a Monkey. I won't venture to be a Judge, to determine whether the Priefl or the God is the moft ridiculous Brute, and yet I think the Pried has fome Advantage of thofe on Zcloan, who w T orfhip a Monkey's Tooth only. Bimlifatam lies about 4 Leagues to the North-eaft of Vtzagapatam. The 'Dutch keep a fmall Faftory there, confifting of four Eu ropeans. The Country People manufadure Cloth, both coarfe and fine, which the Dutch buy up for Batavia. About 4 Miles offShore, Bmlipatam 7 there are fome Rocks that — appearnew Account appear above Water, called San ft a Tilla. A Ship may pafs between them and the Shore without Danger. And that is all worth Ob- fervation there. There are no European Factories to the Eaftward on the Coalt of CJjormondeh but Ganjam. It is kept for the Chief of Vizaga- fatams Ufe, tho' a Company might find their Account there better than in many Places that they keep Fadories in. It lies about 5-5- Leagues to the North-eaftward otVizagapa- tarn \ but there are feveral other Places be tween them on the Coaft, that drive a fmall Trade in Corn. Tondee, Call'ingapatam and Sunapore are the moft noted, but are not frequented by Europeans. The Country about Ganjam is fruitful in Rice and Sugar-cane, and they make pretty good Sugars, both white and brown. It has She Benefit of a River, but not navigable, nor the Bar pafTable for Ships, till the Month of Septemberj that the Frefhes from the Mountains open it, and then there is three fathoms on it, but it fliuts again about the Beginning of November, and, in the other Months, there are not above 7 or 8 Foot at Hifift-water. The Town flands about a Mile within the Bar, on a rifing Ground, and is governed by a Chowdrie, an Officer deputed by the Nabob. And there is a Pagod in it, dedica ted to an obfcene God, called Gopalfamt. He is carried fometimes in Proceflion thro* the Streets, and fometimes into the Fields nea;of the Eaft Indies. 379 near the Town. They allow him a Coacl^, becaufe he cannot walk, and he has always above a Dozen of Clergymen to accompany him in his Coach. Around his 1 emple, and on the Coach, are carved Figures of Gods and GoddefTes, in fuch obfcene Poftures, that it would puzzle the Covent Garden Nymphs to imitate. One of his Company in the Coach has a Stick about two Foot in Length, and one End is carved in Shape of a Prlafus. The Stick is placed between his Legs, and the End flicking out before him, and all Vir gins and married Women that neyer had Children, come and worlhip the Stick, and the Priefls beitow Bleffings on them to make them fruitful. I he Woods produce Tim ber for building. It is very heavy, but the Itrongeft Wood I ever faw^, tho' not laiting. They alfo produce Bees-wax and StickLack, and pretty good Iron. And the inland Coun tries manufacture Cotton into feveral S01 Cloths, both fine and coarfe, all fit tor Ex portation.

Treats of the Sea-coafl and fome inland Coun~ tries in the ancient Kingdom of Orixa, by the Natives called Oria ; with an Account of the famous Temple of Jagarynat. IN the Year 1708. I had Occafion to tra vel from Ganjnm to B alia fore^ by Land, which gave me an Opportunity to fee more of the Countries thro' which I travelled, than moft others could have who travelled by Sea. About three Miles to the Eatlward of Ganjam is lUure, at the End of a Ridge of Moun tains, that divide the ancient Kingdom of Golcondab from Orixa. Irs End runs within Filfol-fhot of the Sea, and there were three or four Sentinels to demand a Tax on every Head that pafl out of, or into Orixa. I had feventeen Servants to carry my C Palanqueen and Baggage, and all the Tax amounted to about three Shillings Sterl. Proceeding far ther, I came to Manikapatam^ where there is a great Inlet from the Sea; but, about a Mile from its Mouth, it divided itfelf into many Chanels, w 7 hich made many fmall I- flands. The Mogul had an Officer there, who examined from whence we came, and whither we were bound. Our Anfwers were iatisfaftory, and he prefented us with fome Poultry^ Rice and Butter, and gave us a Place to lodge in. And, altho' we faw Plenty of Fifii in the Rivers, yet Money could not purchafc one of them, becaufe there is a Pa-of the Eaft Indies. cod on a little Hill built of Iron-coloured btone, where all the Animals of the watery Element are worlhipped. And Water-fowls are fo facred, that they mull not be killed. Our next Stage was at the famous Temple of Jagarynat, which, in clear Weather, may be' feen from Manikafatam. In our Way we law great Numbers of Deer and Antilopes, fo tarpe, that they would not move out of our W r ay, till we approacht within five or li* Yards of them. Water wild Fowl were aU fo numerous and fearlefs, for none dares kill them under Pain of Excommunication, which cannot be removed but by round Sums to the Church. Poultry there is plentiful, but can not be killed by the Ta&amp;ans, becaufe they worfliip them ; nor can Strangcis purchafe them, only the Mahometans, who make no Account of their canon Laws, make bold tQ facritice them, and Fifh too, as we do in Great Britain. . In all thisTraft between Ganjam and Ja~ Zarwat, the viable God in moil Efleem is Gopalfami, whofe Temples, as I faid before, are decorated with obfcene Reprefentations of jMen and Women in indecent Poiluics, al- fo of Demons and Caco-demons, whofe Ge nitals are of a prodigious Size in Proportion, to their Bodies, the filthy Image is wor- fhipped by all the Heathens of both Sexes, but barren W omen are his greateil Devotees, and bring him the bell Oblations. ^ Javarynat has vaft Crowds of P|lgn ms ro viiit bim from all Parts ot India. Hii I ^ nj ^ e3^1 A new Account Hands in a Plain about a Mile from the Sea,' and no Mountains nor Outlets of Rivers near it. It is built of a free hard Stone, the Pedeflal of large fquare Stone, and clofe by it is a Ciftern built about with large oblong fquare Stones of different Colours, viz. Brick- colour, light blue, gray and white. The Ci- llern has Steps that run the whole Length of the Ciftern, which is about 40 or 50 Yards, and, at the End oppofite to the Pagod, Steps of the whole Breadth of it, which is about ^5 or 30 Yards, each Step about a Foot deep, defcending, by Gradation, under the Surface of the Water, which did not feem to be clear, but, they fay, is three Fathoms deep in the Middle. This Ciftern or Tank is wal led round with a Stone Wall about 5 Foot high, with two Iron Gates to let in Pilgrims, and keep out unfan^ified Perfons, as Chrt- ft tans, Mahometans^ &amp;rc. for all Pilgrims are obliged to wafh in that Tank before they go into the Temple to worlhip. The Temple is built in the Shape of a Canary Pipe fet on End, about 40 or 50 Yards high, about the Middle is the Image of an Ox cut in one intire Stone, bigger than a live one. He looks towards the South-eaft, and his hin der Parts are fixt in the Wall. TheFabrick is crowned with a Top about the fame Dia meter that it is in the Middle, and the Tem ple being exactly round, makes no contem ptible Figure in Architedure. On the Weft Side of the Pagod, there is a large Chapel that joyns it, wherein Sermons are daily preach-of the Eaft Indies. 585 preached; and there are fome Convents at a little Diftance for the Priefls to lodge in, who daily officiate. There are, in all, about 500 of them that belong to the Pagod, who daily bovl Rice and Pulfe for the Uie of the God. They report, that there are five Can dies daily dreit, each Candy containing 1600 lb. Weight. When fome Part has been car ried before the Idol, and the Smoke had fa- luted his Mouth and Nofe, then the Remain der is fold out, in fmall Parcels, to thofe who will buy it, at very reafonable Rates, and the Surplus is ferved out to the Poor, who are ever attending the Pagod out of a pretend ed Devotion: And this Food, that is dreft for the Pagod, has a particular Privilege a- bove other Eatables, that the purified Hea then is not contaminated by eating out of the fame Difh with polluted Qhr'ifttans or Mah- rnetans^ tho' in another Place, it would be reckoned a mortal Sin. 1 fiaid there one Day and two Nights, and my Lodgings were in an Houfe very near the Pagod. The Nights were fpent in beat ing on Tabors and Brafs Cymbals, with Songs of Praifes on Jagarynat, who is only a Stone God, not carved into a Figure, but an irregular pyramidal black Stone of about 4 or 500 lb. Weight, with two rich Diamonds placed near the Top, to reprefent Eyes, and a Nofe and Mouth painted with Vermilion, to Ihew his Devotees that he can both fmell and tafle. There are no Windows in the Temple to give Light, fo that he has Ule584 A new Account tor about ioo Lamps continually burning be fore him. He is railed about, that none may approach near him but his Prielts; and on ly thofe of the firft Quality dare enter into the Sanfytum fanttorum, I would fain have gone into the Temple, but could not be admitted, tho' I profered the Value of three Guineas for Admittance, but I fent one of my Servants, who was a Gentow, to obferve what he could, and he brought me the foregoing Account. H e is never removed out of the Temple, but his Effigie is often carried abroad in Pro- ce/Tion, mounted on a Coach four Stories high. It runs on eight or ten Wheels, and is capable to contain near 200 Perfons. It is drawn thro' a large Street about fo Yards wide, and half a League long, by a Cable of 14 Inches Circumference, and, at convenient Dirtances, they faften fmall Ropes to the Cable, two or three Fathoms long, fo that upwards of 2 .000 People have Room enough to draw the Coach, and fome old Zealots, as it paffes thro' the Street, fall flat on the Ground, to have the Honour to be crufht to Pieces by the Coach Wheels, and, if they meet with that good Fortune to be killed outright, the Prielts make the Mob believe, that the Defund's Soul is much in favour with the Idol, but if only a Leg, a Thigh or an Arm are cruflit, then the Devotee is not fandified enough to be taken Notice of, how ever, it they die of their Bruifes, their Bo dies are burned as well as the others, and • their^ ■ mrnmrnm^mm of the Eaft Indies. 385 their Souls go into Paradife, or a Place ve ry near it, without (lopping at the half-way Houfe to be purged from their Sins, as o- thers lefs pure are obliged to do. They have a Tradition^ that this famous Idol was not originally of the Country he How (lays in, but, 3 or 4000 Years ago, he fwimm'd over the Sea, and lome Fifhers feeing him ly at High-water Mark^ went near him* and, to their great Aflonifliment, heard him fay in their own vernacular Language, that he came out of pure Charity to re/lde among them, and dejired that he might have a good Lodging built for him, on that fame Spot of Ground that he now dwells on. The Fifhers told this Story to their ghoftly Fathers, who €ame in Troops to fee the Stone that could talk fo prettily, and would have excufed themfelves of the Trouble of building an Houfe fit to entertain his Godlhip, but he would not be denied; and, tho' there are no Stone-quarries nor Mountains to be feen with in Reach of the Eye, he promifed to furmih them with good Stone and Lime to build his Houfe, if they would but take the Trouble* and fo, every Night, Materials were brought as there was Need, and, in a Ihort Time, his Houfe was built, as it now is. And there are reckoned, in the fame Town, no lefs than 400 Temples built in Honour to Jagarynat —and his Relations. Had Jagarynat ftaidbut twenty or thirtf Centuries, and fwimm'd to the Shore of fome Chr 'tjlian Qatholick Country, he would have | U h found, I 38(5 A ne-w Account ^ found an hearty Welcome, and would not have been obliged to confine himfelf to one Houfe without Windows, but would have had an hundred Palaces built for him, with fwinoine great W indows for to give him Day- liaht -r and Hundreds of good Wax-candles burning before him Night and Day, inilead of Lamps, whofe Charge is much lefs than Virgin Wax, and their Light much dimmer. Whether this Story of Jagarynat y or thofe of the miraculous Adventures of Xavi- er, and the Ship that run from Cape Bona JEfperanza to Goa in one Night, aic moft to be credited, I leave to the Determination of the unprejudiced Judges of Controverfy in Points polemical. # The Prince of this Country is ^ Heat hefty and pays a Tribute to the Mogul of a Lack of Rupees yearly, or ix^ooZ/. Sterl. which is paid into the Exchequer at Gut tack. And the Prince exads a Tax of half aCrown^7 Head on every Pilgrim that comes to the Pagod to worlliip, which generally amounts to 75000 L. per Annum. % . . { This Country abounds in Corn, Clotn, Cattle, Deer and Antelopes. Bears and Mon- kies are very numerous and feailefs. There is alfo Plenty of Water-fowl, Partridge and Pheafant, all tame, becaufe none dares kill them but the Prince, except thofe whom he e;ives written Licences to, and they are but feldom obtained. The Country is \v a- tered with many fmall Rivers, whofe Out lets to the Sea are at Manikafatam and fiportof the Eaft Indies, /tfore, and there are many Bridges of Stone over thofe little Rivers, and great Numbers of Beggars near thofe Bridges, asking Alms m the Name of Jagarynat The Prince who reigned 1708. had a peculiar Efteem for Europeans in ge- ?| ra '' , ' ,r ' one Day as he was a hunting, his Horfe fell, and the Prince broke his Thigh- bone, and accidentally an European Surge- 1 - on being in the Town, fet the Bone, and made a perfeft Cure, and was rewarded with 45' ^ Sterl. for it. When I was there, he was abroad a him- ing, and he fent me a Compliment, that he clclired to iee me; but I excufed myfelf on account of my having a Fit of the Gout, and ne was fatisfied with the Excufe, and fent me a good fat Buck for my Supper; and fe- veral of the belt Gentlemen in Town, came, with their Compliments, next Morning, to invite me to ftay a few Days till his High- nels retui^icd from hunting; but my Bufinefs being pre/ling, I returned their Civilities in thepropereft Terms I could, and took Leave to proceed on my Journey. W hen I had travelled three or four Lea gues from Jagarynat, I left the Sea-lhore, and took my Way towards on a very tme Road, where I faw many Droves of Cat tle and wild Game, and feveral Monuments ot zealous Pilgrims, who had fignalized them- lelves by fevere Penances, and one particu larly, that, about three Months before I was there, had, out of Zeal, built a Tomb for ' t. B b a him-388 A nemo Account himfclf, and, when it was finilhed, took hi3 Leave of his Friends in Form, and entred into his new Cell, and ftaid till he died for Want of Suftenance. I challenge any Chrifti- an Penitents to do more, in Ads of Super erogation, than this blind Heathen did. CHAP. XXXII. Is an Account of the mar'it'im Towns mi the Coaji (?/Orixa, which terminates at Balla- fore; alfo of feme inland 1?Laces through which 1 travelled. FROM the Dominions of Jagarynat, I came into thofe of Arfipore. The Town, where the Rajah refided, is named after the Province, and there is a fine River that in vites Strangers to frequent it for Cotton Cloth and Rice, that this Country affords in great Plenty. And, in fixfcore Miles that I travelled between Jagarjnat and Cattack, I found little elfe worth noticing but Numbers of Villages interfperfl in the plain Countries, and, at every ten or twelve Miles End, a Fellow to demand Junkaun or Poll-money for me and my Servants, which generally came to a Peny or three half Pence a Piece, fo that, in the whole, it coft me about 1 L, Sterl. for PafTage-gilt. The next Place to Arfifore, on the Sea- coaft, \$ Ray fore y that llands on the Banks ot the River oiQattack^ where it difembogues intoof the Eaft Indies. jgp into the Sea, about mid -way between Point Faifo and Point Talmeira. It has a fine Bar aftording leven Fathoms Water on it in Spring, tides, it is not frequented by Europeans^ tho', no Doubt, it was before Aurengzel conquered the Country, for it produceth Corn, Cloth very fine, Butter and Oyl in great A bundance. The City of Cat tack Hands on an Ifland of this River, about 2,5- Leagues from the Sea. W he n I came to the River ot Cattack, I efpied a fmall Pagod, built in Form of a Cu^ pola. The Out-lide had Holes in it, like the Holes of a Pigeon-houfe, placed in Order, and in each Hole was a Man's Skull. Enqui^ ring the Reafon why fuch a Number of Skulls were put there, I was informed, that when Jurengzeb\ Army came to befiege Cattack^ there was a Confpiracy in the Town to be tray it, ^)ut being detected, above five Hun dred that were concerned in it, were, by Or der or the King of Qnxa y who was then in the City, condemned to be beheaded, and their Heads to be placed in thofe Holes, and there they have continued ever fince. Clofe bv that Temple, we took Boat to carry us to the City, the River, on that Side, being about a Mile broad, and founding it in the Middle, I found fix Fathoms. The River Water is very clear, and wholfom to drink, and de- fcends with a flow Stream, T he Springs of the River are from the Mountains of Gatti, within 40 Leagues of and, in its Paffage, waflies Part of the B b 3 King- 1 . ii si39° 4 new Account Kingdoms of Taiinga, Vifapore, Golcondah, and Orixa, blelling all the Countries that it palFes through, with Fertility of Com, even to i he Place where it lofes it felf,and there it is alio beneficent, in affording a conveni ent Harbour for Shipp : ng,tho' it is not much frequented by Strangers, and not at all by Europeans. 1 believe the Reafon is, that ma-, ry Rajahsy of different Interells, have their Countries on the Sides of the River, and they joad the Trade with fo many Taxes and Im- poliiions, that the induflrious Merchant can- riot get any Profit by his Labour; and the Reins of the A/^w/'s Government being fo llack in thole Parts, the Nabob of Orixa is not capable to keep the contentious Rajahs in better Order. Cat tack is ftill a large City, willed round, end a good many Cannon planted on its W alls, but neither the Wall nor ArciHery are Kept in good Order. The Town is not one Quarter Part inhabited; but the Ruins of ir.any large Buildings fhew fufficiently its an cient Grandeur, when Kings kept their Courts there. Its Figure is an Oblong for a League long, and a Mile broad. It is garifoned with fooo Foot, and 5-00 Horfe. The Company had once a fine Fa^oryin Cat tack. Moft of its Walls were Ending in Anno 1708. and a Garden that be longed to the Fa^ory, was then in good Re^ pair, kept by a Perfon of Quality in the Town. The Country about abounds in Corn and C^ttle^ *ind tame and wild Fowl are very PknUiof the Eaft Indies. 391 plentiful and good. Their Manufadory is in Cotton Cloths, coarfe and fine of all Sorts, and very cheap, and fo are Butter and Oyl. I boueht a few Seerbands and Sannoes there, to know the Difference of the Prices between Qat tack and Ballafbre Markets, and I found Cattack fold them about 60 per Cent, cheap er f han Ballafore 5 but, on the Road, which is about 35 Leagues long, we paid feven or eiaht Times Toll for our Heads and Croods, 'which made them come out about 2.8 per Cent, better than Ballafore Market. That Part of the River, on the North Side of Cattack, is very Ihallow. W hen I pail it, there were not above three toot W atei 111 it. They have a Cultom in this Town, that, when any Stranger travels thro it, he muit find Surety, that he'll carry none of the in habitants off with him, without the Nabobs PermHTion, and if the Stranger can find no Security, the Nabolis Secretary Uxomcs bound for paying him fen Rupees tor the Danger he runs. Two 'Dutch Ren ago aoes^ who were in the Nabobs Service as Qrun- ners, came to wait on me, with a Prefent or Mutton, Fowl and Filh, and protered to be my Sureties. I rewarded them with the ufual Perquifite due to the Secretary, and gave them a Bottle of French Brandy, which they fet a great Value on. t1 , . „ W hen I left Cattack, I travelled about &gt;0 Miles in two Days, and came to badruct, which (lands on the Side of a River, that runs into the Sea at Cunnaca, about 20 Miles below B b 4 ha192* ^ Account Badntck. There are about 1000 Houfes in if, and a fmall Mud-wall Fort, but never a Gun in it. The Inhabitants are moftly em ployed in Husbandry, Spinning, Weaving and Churning, and Butter here is pretty cheap, being accounted dear at a Peny per Pound Weight. In two Days I travelled from Ba- druck to Ballafore, and faw nothing in the 'Way, but Things common and indifferent, the Produft of the Country being Corn and Cloth, Iron, Annife and Cummin-feeds, Oyl and Bees-wax. Iron is fo plentiful, that they call Anchors for Ships in Moulds, but they are not fo good as thofe made in Europe. I mull now return back to Raypore^ and travel along the Sea-coaft. Four Leagues from Raypore is the Ifland of Talmeira, which lies about a Mile from the Shore, and has a Chanel of two Fathoms deep between them. The Country is here very low, but the I- Hand lower, and it fends off a very dange rous Sand Bank fo far into the Sea, that the Ifland can fcarcely be feen till a Ship is a^ ground. Within 5*0 Paces of the Bank are fixteen Fathoms Water, which fudden ShaU lowings make it the more dangerous. T hree Leagues to the Northward of the Point Taltneira, is Cnnnaca, which River is capable to receive a Ship of 100 Tuns. It has a Bar, but not dangerous, becaufe the Sea is fmooth, and the Bottom foft. The Nabob of Cattack commands the North Side of the River, and a Rajah the other, which makes them both court the Merchant that comesof the Eaft Indies; Comes to trade there, for he pays Cuftom only to the Sovereign, whofe Side of the River his Ship lies on. The Produce and Manufadories of the Country, I mentioned already. About iz Leagues to the Northward of Cunnaca, is the River's Mouth of Ballafore, where there is a very dangerous Bar, fuffi- ciently well known by the many Wracks and Lolles made by it. Between Cunnaca and Ball afire Rivers there is one continued Tan dy Bay, where prodigious Numbers of Sea Tortoifes refort to lay their Eggs; and a ve ry delicious Fifli called the 'Famflee, comes in Sholes, and are fold for two Pence per Hundred. Two of them are fufficient to dine a moderate Man. T he Town is but four Miles from the Sea by Land, but, by the River, twenty. The Country is fruitful to Admiration, produc ing Rice, VV heat, Gram, 'Doll Callavances^ feveral Sorts ofPulfe,Annife, Cummin, Cori ander and Caraway Seeds, Tobacco, Butter, Oyl and Bees-wax. Their Manufadories are of Cotton in Sannis, CaJ/as, Ttemeties, MuU mnls. Silk, and Silk and Cotton Romals, Gur- rahs and Lungies ; and of Herba (a Sort of tough Grafs} they make Ginghams, T 'tnafcosy and feveral other Goods for Exportation. The Englijh, French and Dutch have their refpeaive Factories here, but, at pre- fent, are of little Confideration, tho' in for mer l imes, before the Navigation of Hugh*m A new Account Ly River was cultivated, they were the head Faftories in the Bay or Gulf of Bengal. The Town of BaLlafore drives a pretty good Trade to the Iflands of Maldiva, Thofe Iflands, as I obferved before, have no Rice or other Grain of their own Product, fo that Ballafore fupplies them with what Neceffaries they want, and, in Return, bring Cowries and Cayar for the Service of Ship ping. The Sea-fhore of Ballafore being ve ry low, and the Depths of W ater very gra dual from the Strand, make Ships, in Bulla- fore Road, keep at a good Diftance from the Shore, for, in four or five Fathoms, they ride three Leagues off. From Afr 'tl to OEtober is the Seafon for Shipping to come into the Bay of Bengal. Pilots ly ready at Ballafore to carry them up the River Hughlyy which is a fmall Branch ot the famous Ganges. The European Com panies, before mentioned^ keep theirs always in Pay; but, when none of their own Ship ping is there, their Pilots have the Liberty to ferve other Ships, which is no fmall Ad vantage to them. The People about Ballafore have one par ticular Cullom that I never heard of in any other Country, v 'tz. they take a Piece of foft Clay, and make it in the Form of a large Supporitory l and they harden it in the Sun, till it comes to the Confidence of foft VVax, and, when they think it fit for Ufe, they put it into the right Inteftine, immediately after Exoneration. This, they alledge, keeps themof the Eaft Indies. them cool, tho', after it has been in Ijie a Day and a Night, it becomes hard, but even ly Morning they have a new one ready for Ufe. T here is a Report current among the Englifl) in India-, that the old EaJl- 'tndiaQom* pany delired one Captain Goodlad, who was going in their Service Commander of a Ship to Bengal, that he would bring them Home fome Indian Rarity that had never been feen in England before. And being lodged in the Fadory at Ballafire, looking out of his Window one Morning, he faw fome People making Ufeof their Siippofitories, and leaving the old hard bak'd ones behind therm He immediately bethought himfelf of the Corn- million he had from his Mallersj and judged that they might be Rarities never feen in Eu rope before, and ordered a fmall Keg to be filled with them. When he brought them to England, they proved to be fuch as they had never feen. Some Gentlemenj more curious than the red, fcrapt fome of them to try the Ta{le,but they dill continued in the Dark, till the comical Captain gave them an Account of their life and Virtue. The Sides of the River are overgrown with Bulhes, which give Shelter to many fierce and troublefom Tigers, who do much Mifchief. I knew an Englijh Man that was in a Ship's Boat laden with trefh W ater, ly ing in the River, waiting the Tide to carry her over the Bar, and this Man had the Cu- riolity to Hep alhore, and being a little W ay from59^ ^ w*® Account from the Boat, had a Call to exonerate, and had nofooner put himfelf in a Pollure near the Bullies, but out leaps a Tiger, and caught both his Buttocks in his Mouth, and was for carr) ing him away, but one of the Seamen in the Boat feeing the Tragedy, took up a JMusket, and placed a Bullet in the Tiger's Head, while the Man was in his Mouth help- lefs. The Tiger immediately let him fall, and fculkt in among the Bulhes, and the wound ed Man was carried on board of his Ship, and the Surgeon made a perfect Cure of the Wounds. I faw the Marks of the Wounds three or four Years after the Accident hap pened to him. And now having led you as far Eaftward as ^Alexander the Great led his Army, even to the famous River Ganges^ which put a Stop to his Travels, I'll venture farther, and vifit both the Banks of that River, upwards and downwards, and then march as far Eall; as our Ruropean Navigation has as yet difcoverecf: Thefecond Volume will difcover whether I keep my Pro- mifeor not, and fo I proceed.
